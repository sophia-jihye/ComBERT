 Item 1. Busines s 

Overview 

We were formed in 2005 as a Delaware limited liability company until our conversion on March 6, 2015 into a Delaware limited partnership. We are focused on the acquisition, development, ownership and operation of midstream and other energy producing assets. Historically, our operations have consisted of the exploration and production of proved reserves located in the Cherokee Basin in Oklahoma and Kansas, the Woodford Shale in the Arkoma Basin in Oklahoma, the Central Kansas Uplift in Kansas, the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and in other areas of Texas and Louisiana. In October 2015, we consummated the acquisition of midstream assets in the Eagle Ford Shale (the &#8220;Catarina gathering system&#8221;) from Sanchez Energy and entered into a 15-year gathering and processing agreement with Sanchez Energy (the &#8220;Catarina gathering and processing agreement&#8221;). 

We have entered into a shared services agreement (the &#8220;Services Agreement&#8221;) with Manager pursuant to which Manager provides services that we require to operate our business, including overhead, technical, administrative, marketing, accounting, operational, information systems, financial, compliance, insurance, professionals and acquisition, disposition and financing services. 

Our common units are currently listed on the NYSE MKT under the symbol &#8220;SPP.&#8221; 

Our Relationship with Sanchez Energy, Manager and SOG 

We believe that our relationship with Sanchez Energy provides us with growth opportunities through Sanchez Energy selling additional assets to us over time and facilitating organic growth opportunities and accretive acquisitions from other third parties. Sanchez Energy is currently a high-quality anchor customer for the Catarina gathering system. According to its filings with the SEC, Sanchez Energy had as of December 31, 2015, approximately 200,000 net leasehold acres in the oil and condensate windows of the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas, with total proved reserves of 128 MMBoe, including 85 MMBoe in the dedicated acreage subject to the Catarina gathering and processing agreement. In addition, pursuant to a right-of-first-offer, Sanchez Energy has agreed to provide us the first right to make an offer to purchase any midstream assets and reversionary working interests that it desires to sell, although there can be no assurance that we would be able to acquire any such assets on terms reasonably acceptable to us, or at all. Sanchez Energy is under no obligation to sell any assets to us or to accept any offer for its assets that we may choose to make. We do not have a current agreement or understanding with Sanchez Energy to purchase any assets covered by our right-of-first-offer. 

We believe that our relationship with Manager will provide us with competitive advantages operationally. Manager is the sole member of our general partner and has an interest in us through its ownership of all of our incentive distribution rights. Pursuant to the Services Agreement, Manager provides services that we require to operate our business, including overhead, technical, administrative, marketing, accounting, operational, information systems, financial, compliance, insurance, acquisition, disposition and financing services, in exchange for a quarterly fee, the reimbursement of all allocated overhead costs as well as any direct third-party costs incurred and a fee for each asset acquisition, asset disposition and financing. 

Manager utilizes SOG to provide the services under the Services Agreement. SOG has a senior management team that averages over 20 years of industry experience and employs over 200 full-time employees, including 46 technical staff and engineers. SOG has a dedicated business development team that screens approximately 150 acquisition opportunities per year. 

In May 2014, we entered into a Contract Operating Agreement with SOG pursuant to which SOG either provides services to operate, develop and produce our oil and natural gas properties or engages a third-party operator to do so, other than with respect to our properties in the Mid-Continent Region. We also have entered into a Geophysical Seismic Data Use License Agreement with SOG pursuant to which SOG provides us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use seismic, 

&#160;

geophysical and geological information relating to our oil and natural gas properties that is proprietary to SOG and not restricted by agreements that SOG has with landowners or seismic data vendors. 

Although we believe that our relationships with SOG and Sanchez Energy provide us with a significant advantage in acquiring assets in the midstream and producing asset markets, there is no assurance that we will achieve such an advantage or otherwise benefit as a result of these relationships. While our relationships with SOG, Sanchez Energy and its subsidiaries is a significant strength, it also is a source of potential conflicts. Please read &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Business Strategy 

Our primary business objective is to create long-term value and to generate stable cash flows that allow us to make and grow distributions over time. We plan to achieve our objective by executing our business strategy, which is to: 

&#183; 

Conduct a sales process to evaluate and pursue the possible divestiture of our Mid-Continent assets in 2016; 

&#183; 

Align our asset base, interests and operations with our sponsor, SOG; 

&#183; 

Grow our business by acquiring cash producing assets involved in production, gathering and processing activities with minimal maintenance capital requirements and low overhead; and 

&#183; 

Reduce the volatility in our cash flows resulting from changes in oil and natural gas commodity prices and interest rates through efficient hedging programs. 

Business Segments 

Our business activities are conducted by two operating segments for which we provide information in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. These two segments are our: 

&#183; 

midstream business, which includes the Catarina gathering system; and 

&#183; 

exploration and production business, which includes oil and natural gas reserves located in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and in other areas of Texas and Louisiana, as well as properties in the Mid-Continent region. 

For information about our segments&#8217; revenues, profits and losses and total assets, see Note 15. &#8220;Reporting Segments&#8221; of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Midstream Business 

Catarina Gathering System 

In October 2015, we acquired the Catarina gathering system from Sanchez Energy. The system consists of gathering assets, pipelines, processing units, compression units and other related assets in Western Catarina, which are located in Dimmit and Webb Counties, Texas and service upstream production from the Eagle Ford Shale. The Catarina gathering system consists of approximately 150 miles of gathering lines, compressors, tanks, vessels and other miscellaneous production infrastructure. The gathering pipelines range in diameter from 4 to 12 inches, with capacity of 40,000 barrels per day for crude oil and NGLs, and 200 MMcf/d for natural gas. There are four main gathering and processing facilities, which include eight stabilizers of 5,000 barrels per day, approximately 25,000 barrels of storage capacity, NGL pressurized storage, approximately 18,000 horsepower of compression and approximately 300 MMcf/d of dehydration capacity. The gathering system is used solely to support the gathering, processing and transportation of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas produced by Sanchez Energy in the Western Catarina. The gathering system has crude oil interconnects with the Plains All American Pipeline header system delivered to the Gardendale terminal, and to all four takeaway pipelines to Corpus Christi, and it has natural gas interconnects with Southcross Energy, Kinder Morgan, Energy Transfer and Transwestern 

&#160;

Pipeline. Pipeline capacity on the gathering system can be expanded through small compression projects at a nominal cost, with approximately $1.0 million in capital expenditures planned per year. 

During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, Sanchez Energy transported average daily production through the gathering system of approximately 4,272 Bbls of crude oil and 9,221 Boe of natural gas. The average age of the Catarina gathering system assets is approximately 5 years, and they have an expected life of approximately 25 more years. 

Customer 

Our midstream business has one customer, Sanchez Energy, as a result of having entered into the Catarina gathering and processing agreement. All of the revenue from the Catarina gathering system are currently earned under this agreement. Pursuant to the 15-year agreement, Sanchez Energy tenders all of its crude petroleum, natural gas and other hydrocarbon-based product volumes on 35,000 dedicated acres in the Western Catarina of the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas for processing and transportation through the gathering system, with a right to tender additional volumes outside of the dedicated acreage. During the first five years of the term (or through 2020), Sanchez Energy has agreed to tender a minimum quarterly volume of 10,200 barrels per day of crude oil and NGLs and 142,000 Mcf per day of natural gas in the dedicated acreage. Sanchez Energy is required to pay us gathering and processing fees of $0.96 per barrel for crude oil and condensate produced and $0.74 per Mcf for natural gas that are tendered through the Catarina gathering system, in each case, subject to an annual escalation for a positive increase in the consumer price index. After the end of the 15 year agreement, the rate will be subject to renegotiation between the parties. Except for a force majeure or temporary shutdown for testing and maintenance, we are obligated to transport all crude petroleum or other hydrocarbon-based products tendered by Sanchez Energy on the Catarina gathering system for shipment up to the minimum volume per day that Sanchez Energy is required to tender. 

Title to Properties 

Title to the gathering system assets falls into two categories: parcels that are owned in fee and parcels in which our interest is derived from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities, permitting the use of such land for our operations. Portions of the land on which portions of the gathering system are located are owned by us in fee title, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to these lands. The remaining land on which the gathering system is located are held by us pursuant to surface leases between us, as lessee, and the fee owner of the lands, as lessors. Our predecessors leased or owned these lands for many years without any material challenge known to us relating to the title to the land upon which the assets are located, and we believe that we have satisfactory leasehold estates or fee ownership in such lands. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or license that is held by us or to the title to any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or lease that have, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of the material leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses with respect to the Catarina gathering system. 

Exploration and Production Business 

Our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2015, were approximately 11.6 MMBoe, approximately 99% of which were classified as proved developed, with 67% being natural gas, 6% being NGLs, and 27% being oil. At December 31, 2015, we owned approximately 1,992 net producing wells. Our total average proved reserve-to-production ratio is approximately 8.1 years and our portfolio decline rate is 12% to 24% based on our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2015 and production for the month ended December 31, 2015. 

Below is a description of our operations and our oil and natural gas properties by basin at December 31, 2015: 

&#160;

Locations 

We have oil and gas properties in three basins in the Mid-Continent region of the United States: 

&#183; 

Cherokee Basin, where we had approximately 6.6 MMBoe of estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2015, approximately 98% of which were classified as proved developed, with 93% being natural gas and 7% being oil; 

&#183; 

Woodford Shale, where we had approximately 84 MBoe of estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2015, all of which were classified as proved developed and natural gas; and 

&#183; 

Central Kansas Uplift, where we had approximately 30 MBoe of estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2015, all of which were classified as proved developed, with 7% being natural gas and 93% being oil. 

In addition, we own properties in the onshore Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast Region, where we had approximately 4.8 MMBoe of estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2015, all of which were classified as proved developed, with 30% being natural gas, 15% being NGLs, and 55% being oil. 

Operations 

We do not operate any of our oil and gas properties, except in the Cherokee Basin where we operate a substantial portion of our properties. In the Woodford Shale, approximately 95% of the wells are operated by affiliates of Linn Energy LLC and Newfield Exploration Mid-Continent, Inc., with the remaining wells operated by three additional companies. Murfin Drilling Company, Inc., an experienced oil producer in Kansas, operates all of our wells in the Central Kansas Uplift. Zachry Exploration, LLC operates assets located in onshore southern Louisiana, with the remaining wells in Texas being operated by SOG. 

Proved Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Reserves 

The following table reflects our estimates of proved oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves based on the SEC definitions that were used to prepare our financial statements for the periods presented.

(a) 

Standardized Measure is the present value of estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves. It is determined using SEC-required prices and costs in effect as of the time of estimation without giving effect to non-property related expenses (such as general and administrative expenses or debt service costs) and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. Our Standardized Measure does not include the impact of derivative 

&#160;

transactions or future federal income taxes because we are not subject to federal income taxes. Future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. The Standardized Measure shown should not be considered the current market value of our reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate present value, which is required, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate. 

Our 2015 estimates of total proved reserves decreased 5.1 MMBoe from 2014 due to a 24.1 Bcf decrease in undeveloped gas reserves in the Cherokee Basin. The higher volumes in 2014 were due to a higher gas price. Our reserves are 67% natural gas and are sensitive to lower prices for natural gas and basis differentials in the Mid-Continent region. For the proved reserves, the production weighted average product price over the remaining lives of the properties used in our reserve report are $50.28 per barrel for oil, $19.90 per barrel for NGLs and $2.58 per Mcf for natural gas. 

We have a successful track record of developing our proved undeveloped reserves. We do not rely on any proprietary technology to drill our development wells. Based on our organizational structure and our current business plans, our forecasted cash flow over the next five years is expected to be sufficient to fund this type of development drilling program on certain of our proved undeveloped locations. Using the SEC guidelines for estimating proved reserves, all of the locations are scheduled to be drilled within the next five years. 

The following table summarizes our inventory of proved undeveloped locations as of December 31, 2015:

Excluding acquisitions, we expect to make capital expenditures related to drilling and completion of wells of approximately $0.8 million during the year ending December 31, 2016. No PUDs were removed in 2015 due to performance issues. 296 PUDs were removed from the future drilling schedule in 2015 due to lower oil and natural gas prices. No locations are included that would generate positive future net revenue but have negative present worth when discounted at 10 percent. 

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, Netherland, Sewell &#38; Associates, Inc. (&#8220;NSAI&#8221;) and Ryder Scott Co. LP (&#8220;Ryder Scott&#8221;), independent oil and natural gas engineering firms, prepared estimates of all our proved reserves. We used NSAI&#8217;s and Ryder Scott&#8217;s estimates of our proved reserves to prepare our financial statements. NSAI and Ryder Scott maintain a degreed staff of highly competent technical personnel. The average experience level of NSAI&#8217;s technical staff of engineers, geoscientists and petro physicists exceeds 20 years, including 5 to 15 years with a major oil company. The engineering information presented in Ryder Scott&#8217;s report was overseen by Don P. Griffin, P.E. Mr. Griffin is an experienced reservoir 

&#160;

engineer having been a practicing petroleum engineer since 1976. He has more than 30 years of experience in reserves evaluation with Ryder Scott. Our technical staff of engineers and geosciences professionals has an average experience level that exceeds 27 years. Our activities with NSAI are coordinated by a reservoir engineer employed by us who has approximately 35 years of experience in the oil and natural gas industry and an engineering degree from the University of Tennessee and a masters of business administration from the University of New Orleans. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. He has prior reservoir engineering and reserves management experience at Exxon Mobil Corporation, Dominion Resources and Hilcorp Energy. He has extensive experience in managing oil and natural gas reserves processes. He serves as the key technical person reviewing the reserve reports prepared by NSAI and Ryder Scott prior to review by the audit committee of the board of directors of our general partner and approval by the board of directors of our general partner.

We did not convert any proved undeveloped wells into proved producing wells in 2015. We had estimated a total of 17 wells scheduled to be converted from the 2014 reserve report. Previously, our focus for capital expenditures was on exploration and development of properties, but it shifted into an acquisition-based approach focusing primarily on producing developed properties to generate stable cash flows under the master limited partnership format. 

&#160; 

Drilling Activity 

The following table sets forth information with respect to oil and natural gas wells drilled and completed by us during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value. Productive wells are those that are capable of producing commercial quantities of oil or natural gas, regardless of whether they produce a reasonable rate of return. No exploratory wells were drilled on any of our properties during the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014.

(d) 

A net acre is deemed to exist when the sum of the fractional ownership working interests in gross acres equals one. The number of net acres is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof. 

&#160;

Leases 

Our leases are concentrated in Oklahoma (85%), Texas (6%), Kansas (8%) and Louisiana (1%). We have approximately 1,537 leases in the Cherokee Basin on 224,300 gross acres, or approximately 215,252 net acres. Our acreage includes areas leased under a concession agreement that we have with the Osage Nation in Osage County, Oklahoma, which provides us with the exclusive right to lease for coalbed methane on up to 560,000 acres within Osage County and the exclusive right for a period of 90 days after drilling a coalbed methane well on any such acreage to lease for oil and natural gas on such acreage. Generally, we have the right each year to elect to license up to a certain amount of acreage under the concession agreement for such year for a specified license payment, and a license must be obtained before we then lease the acreage. During the term of the concession agreement, however, we have the exclusive right to lease the acreage covered thereunder for coalbed methane unless we notify the Osage Nation in writing that we have no intention to lease any particular acreage. Our concession agreement with the Osage Nation requires drilling and completing a specified number of wells between 2005 and 2020, which we had achieved as of December 31, 2012, the most recent drilling target. We believe that the Osage Nation has granted at least two concessions for the drilling of conventional oil and natural gas on acreage which overlaps certain of the acreage covered by our earlier granted concession, and it has taken the position that we are not entitled to conventional oil and natural gas leases under the terms of our concession agreement where we have not drilled a coalbed methane well first. 

The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our other Cherokee Basin properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on or pooled with the leased property. In the Cherokee Basin, depending on the location of a particular well, the total lease burden on our operated properties is generally 20%, generally corresponding to an 80% net revenue interest to us, and on our non-operated properties is generally a 40% net revenue interest. We have approximately 58 leases with a gross acreage position of 3,710 acres, or approximately 893 net acres in the Central Kansas Uplift. We have no leasehold rights associated with our 83 well bores in the Woodford Shale. We have approximately 92 leases in Louisiana with a gross acreage position of 3,318 acres, or approximately 658 net acres. We have approximately 315 leases in Texas with a gross acreage position of 14,570 acres, or 6,862 net acres. 

Under the oil and natural gas lease agreements covering our productive wells, such leases have generally been perpetuated beyond their stated lease term and generally will not expire unless and until associated production ceases. Such leases are said to be &#8220;held by production&#8221; and do not require us to make lease payments beyond the royalty amount stipulated by each lease. The area held by production from a particular well is typically held by lease or applied to a pooled unit for such well or as specified under state law. Barring establishment of commercial production, most of our leases not currently held by production will expire. Approximately 12% and 7% of our total net undeveloped acreage of 12,844 acres is held under leases that have remaining primary terms expiring in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Of these expiration amounts in 2016 and 2017, approximately 83% and 95%, respectively, apply to our concession agreement with the Osage Nation. If these leases do expire, we have the exclusive right to acquire a new coalbed methane lease on any expired acreage under our concession agreement with the Osage Nation until its expiration in 2020 or any earlier termination according to its terms and conditions. The remaining expiring acreage in all three years is primarily located in Kansas and Oklahoma. 

Marketing and Major Customers 

We manage our oil and natural gas marketing efforts and actively monitor our credit exposure to our major customers. We currently sell our natural gas produced in the Cherokee Basin to Macquarie Energy LLC; Keystone Gas Corporation; Scissortail Energy, LLC; Cotton Valley Compression, L.L.C.; Cherokee Basin Pipeline, LLC and ONEOK Energy Services Company, L.P. Our oil production in the Cherokee Basin is primarily purchased by Sunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals L.P. and Coffeyville Resources Refining and Marketing, LLC. Our natural gas production in the Woodford Shale and our oil production in the Central Kansas Uplift is marketed by the operators of our properties. Our natural gas and oil production in the onshore Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast region is marketed by the operators of our properties. 

&#160;

Title to Properties 

When we acquire our interests in oil and natural gas properties, we obtain a title opinion or perform a review on the most significant leases in the fields. As a result, title opinions or reviews have been obtained on a significant portion of our properties. In some instances, and as is customary in our industry, we conduct only a cursory review of the title to certain properties on which we do not have proved reserves. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title requirements on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any material title matters at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured or waived any such title matters or deemed the title risk sufficiently mitigated to justify proceeding with operations on the property. 

We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material oil and gas properties. Title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests and contract terms and restrictions, liens under operating agreements, liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations, liens for current taxes and other burdens, easements, restrictions and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry. We believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens and encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties or will materially interfere with our use in the operation of our business. In addition, we believe that we have obtained sufficient rights-of-way grants and permits from public authorities and private parties to operate our exploration and production business. 

Markets and Competition 

We operate in a competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and retaining trained personnel. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and personnel resources than us. As a result, our competitors may be able to outbid us for assets, more competitively price their gathering and transportation services and oil and gas production, or utilize superior technical resources than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional assets will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable assets and to consummate transactions in a competitive environment. 

The natural gas gathering, compression, treating and transportation business is very competitive. Upon such time that we seek to obtain other customers besides Sanchez Energy for the Catarina gathering system, our competitors will include other midstream companies, producers and intrastate and interstate pipelines. Competition for volumes is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, location, available capacity, capital expenditures and fuel efficiencies. 

We are also affected by competition for drilling rigs, completion rigs and the availability of related equipment. In the past, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling and completion rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which has delayed development drilling activities and has caused significant increases in the prices for this equipment and personnel. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may occur or how they would affect our development and drilling program. To date, however, we have not experienced such shortages. In addition, over the past several years, our field employees have been working with teams of drilling and completion contractors and have developed relationships that should enable us to mitigate the risks associated with equipment availability. 

Neither SOG nor any of its related companies are restricted from competing with us. 

&#160;

Governmental Regulation 

Environmental Laws 

Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences; 

&#183; 

restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances, including water and waste, that can be released into the environment; 

&#183; 

limit or prohibit activities on lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and 

&#183; 

require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells. 

These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible in the absence of such regulations. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. In addition, federal, state and local authorities frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs. 

Environmental laws and regulations that could have a material impact on the oil and natural gas industry and our operations include the following: 

Waste Handling 

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and comparable state laws regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous wastes and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the federal Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;), the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA&#8217;s non-hazardous waste provisions. Although we do not believe that the current costs of managing any of our wastes are material under presently applicable laws, any future reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as hazardous wastes, could increase our costs to manage and dispose of wastes. 

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. 

&#160;

We currently own, lease or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for a number of years. Although we believe that operating and waste disposal practices utilized in the past with respect to these properties were typical for the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination. 

Water Discharges 

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the &#8220;Clean Water Act&#8221;), and comparable state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of produced water and other oil and natural gas wastes, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties, impose investigatory or remedial obligations and issue injunctions limiting or preventing our operations for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. 

Oil Pollution Act 

The Oil Pollution Act was enacted in 1990 to amend the Clean Water Act in large part due to the Exxon Valdez incident. Under the Oil Pollution Act, the EPA was directed to promulgate regulations which would create a comprehensive prevention, response, liability and compensation program to deal with oil discharged into United States navigable waters. In particular, the regulations developed under the Oil Pollution Act strengthened the requirements that apply to Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plans. The Oil Pollution Act imposes liability for removal costs and damages resulting from an incident in which oil is discharged into navigable waters and establishes liability for damages for injuries to, or loss of, natural resources. 

Air Emissions 

The Clean Air Act, and comparable state laws, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. In October 2015, finalized rules that lower the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (&#8220;NAAQS&#8221;) for ozone from 75 parts per billion (&#8220;ppb&#8221;) to 70 ppb. In addition, in September 2015, the EPA proposed rules which defined what are called &#8220;stationary sources&#8221; to resolve how sources of emissions from the crude oil and natural gas sector should be aggregated under Clean Air Act permit programs. Compliance with these or other new legal requirements could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our business. Compliance with these rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business. States can also impose air emissions limitations that are more stringent than the federal standards imposed by the EPA. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Rules restricting air emissions may require a number of modifications to our operations, including the installation of new equipment. Compliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our operating results. However, we believe that our operations will not be materially adversely affected by any such requirements, and the requirements are not expected to be any more burdensome to us than to other similarly 

&#160;

situated companies. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with federal and state air emission standards. 

Climate Change 

While the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (&#8220;GHGs&#8221;), the prospect for adoption of significant legislation at the federal level to reduce GHG emissions is perceived to be low at this time. Nevertheless, the Obama Administration has announced that it intends to adopt additional regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs and to encourage greater use of low carbon technologies. In January 2015, the Administration announced that the EPA plans to propose new regulations that will set methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas production and gas processing and transmission facilities to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. Furthermore, in August 2015, the EPA issued final rules outlining the Clean Power Plan (&#8220;CPP&#8221;), which was developed in accordance with the Administration&#8217;s Climate Action Plan announced the previous year. Under the CPP, carbon pollution from power plants must be reduced over 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations that limit emissions of GHGs could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that exploration and production operators produce, some of whom are our customers, which could thereby reduce demand for our midstream services. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, it is uncertain if they would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. 

Hydraulic Fracturing 

Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing practices and has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities. In 2014, the EPA issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 requesting comments related to disclosure for hydraulic fracturing chemicals. Further, the Department of the Interior has released final regulations governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Native American oil and natural gas leases which require lessees to file for approval of well stimulation work before commencement of operations and require well operators to disclose the trade names and purposes of additives used in the fracturing fluids. The states in which we operate have also adopted disclosure requirements related to fracturing fluids. Legislation has been introduced, but not adopted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In addition, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. Currently, no states in which we utilize hydraulic fracturing have adopted these regulations. At this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing hydraulic fracturing would impact our business. 

Endangered Species 

The Endangered Species Act (&#8220;ESA&#8221;), and analogous state laws, restrict activities that may affect listed endangered or threatened species or their habitats. If endangered species are located in areas where we operate, our operations or any work performed related to them could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. While some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in compliance with the ESA. In addition, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on September 9, 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to review and consider the listing of numerous species as endangered under the ESA by no later than the completion of the agency&#8217;s 2017 fiscal year. 

&#160;

Additional listings under the ESA and similar state laws could result in the imposition of restrictions on our operations and consequently have an adverse effect on our business. 

Gathering System Regulation 

Regulation of pipeline gathering services may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our services. Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated by agencies of the U.S. federal government, primarily the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;). The FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. 

The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce is regulated primarily under the Natural Gas Act (&#8220;NGA&#8221;), and by regulations and orders promulgated under the NGA by the FERC. In certain limited circumstances, intrastate transportation, gathering, and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by the U.S. Congress and by FERC regulations. 

Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to establish whether a pipeline is a gathering pipeline not subject to FERC jurisdiction as a natural gas company. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services has been the subject of substantial litigation and varying interpretations. In addition, the FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our natural gas gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts, or the U.S. Congress. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual gathering facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the FERC. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or the NGPA, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the cost-based rate established by the FERC. 

Gathering service, which may occur upstream of transmission service subject to FERC jurisdiction, is regulated by the states. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. Our purchasing and gathering operations are subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the State of Texas. The ratable take statute generally requires gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, the common purchaser statute generally requires gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. These statutes have the effect of restricting our right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to purchase or transport gas. 

The Railroad Commission of Texas (&#8220;TRRC&#8221;) requires gatherers to file reports, obtain permits, make books and records available for audit and provide service on a nondiscriminatory basis. Shippers and producers may file complaints with the TRRC to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering access and rate discrimination. 

While our systems have not been regulated by the FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA, the U.S. Congress may enact legislation or the FERC may adopt regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to further regulation. Changes in law and to FERC policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action FERC will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas gatherers with which we compete. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability. 

&#160;

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (&#8220;EPAct 2005&#8221;), amended the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by the FERC, and furthermore provides the FERC with additional civil penalty authority. The EPAct 2005 provided the FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 per day for violations of the NGA and increases the FERC&#8217;s civil penalty authority under the Natural Gas Policy Act (&#8220;NGPA&#8221;) from $5,000 per violation per day to $1,000,000 per violation per day. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. In Order No. 670, the FERC promulgated rules implementing the anti-market manipulation provision of the EPAct 2005. The rules make it unlawful, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to: (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The anti-market manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted &#8220;in connection with&#8221; gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. 

Pipeline Safety Regulation 

We are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;) under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (&#8220;HLPSA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes with respect to design, installation, inspection, testing, construction, operation, replacement and maintenance of pipeline facilities. HLPSA covers petroleum and petroleum products, including NGLs and condensate, and requires any entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such regulations, to permit access to and copying of records and to file certain reports and provide information as required by the U.S. Secretary of Transportation. These regulations include potential fines and penalties for violations. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these HLPSA regulations. 

Our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (&#8220;PHMSA&#8221;) pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (&#8220;NGPSA&#8221;) and the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (&#8220;PSIA&#8221;), as reauthorized and amended by the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 (&#8220;PIPES Act&#8221;). The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities, while the PSIA establishes mandatory inspections for all U.S. oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in high-consequence areas (&#8220;HCAs&#8221;). 

PHMSA has developed regulations that require pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs. The regulations require operators, including us, to: 

&#183; 

perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity; 

&#183; 

identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a HCA; 

&#183; 

improve data collection, integration and analysis; 

&#183; 

repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and 

&#183; 

implement preventive and mitigating actions. 

The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (&#8220;2011 Pipeline Safety Act&#8221;) reauthorizes funding for federal pipeline safety programs, increases penalties for safety violations, establishes additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines, and requires studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, among other things, increases the maximum civil penalty for pipeline safety violations and directs the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to promulgate rules 

&#160;

or standards relating to expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, excess flow valve use, leak detection system installation and testing to confirm the material strength of pipe operating above 30% of specified minimum yield strength in HCAs. For example, effective October 25, 2013, PHMSA finalized rules that increased the maximum administrative civil penalties for violation of the pipeline safety laws and regulations after January 2012 to $200,000 per violation per day, with a maximum of $2,000,000 for a series of violations. 

PHMSA regularly revises its pipeline safety regulations and has published advanced notices of proposed rulemakings to solicit comments on the need for changes to its natural gas and liquid pipeline safety regulations, including whether to extend the integrity management program requirements to previously unregulated gathering lines. In 2015 and 2014, PHMSA issued advisory bulletins providing guidance on actions pipeline operators should consider taking to ensure the integrity of pipelines in the event of severe flooding or hurricane damage, notice of construction, flow reversal procedures, product changes and conversion, integrity management program evaluation metrics, and incident response plans. Further changes to PHMSA&#8217;s rules are expected in the future. 

For example, in September 2014, the Government Accountability Office (&#8220;GAO&#8221;) released a report in which the GAO recommended that PHMSA propose a rulemaking to address safety risks, including emergency response planning, from large-diameter, high-pressure gathering lines due to the recent increase in their size and operating pressures. In addition, in July 2014, the EPA&#8217;s Office of Inspector General recommended that the EPA work with PHMSA to address methane leaks from a combined environmental and safety perspective, and also develop a strategy to address the financial and policy barriers that hinder further methane reductions from the transmission and distribution sectors. In January 2015, the EPA unveiled a plan to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent by 2025, using 2012 methane emissions as a baseline. To implement that plan, in September 2015, the EPA issued a proposed rule to amend new source performance standards for the oil and natural gas source category by setting standards for both methane and volatile organic compounds for certain equipment, processes, and activities across the source category, including equipment and processes at gas gathering facilities. Also as part of that plan, the EPA called for PHMSA to propose new standards and programs to reduce methane leaks from natural gas transportation and distribution lines. Moreover, on In July 2015, PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing, inter alia, to extend operator qualification requirements to operators of certain gas gathering lines. In addition, in October 2015, PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing changes to its hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations, including to extend: (i) reporting requirements to all onshore or offshore, regulated or unregulated hazardous liquid gathering lines; and (ii) certain integrity management periodic assessment and remediation requirements to regulated onshore gathering lines. While we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, such regulatory changes and any legislative changes could have a material effect on our operations, particularly by extending more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations (such as integrity management requirements) to pipelines and gathering lines not previously subject to such requirements. While we expect any legislative or regulatory changes to allow us time to become compliant with new requirements, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations. 

Furthermore, DOT regulations have incorporated by reference the American Petroleum Institute Standard 653 (&#8220;API 653&#8221;) as the industry standard for the inspection, repair, alteration and reconstruction of storage tanks. API 653 requires regularly scheduled inspection and repair of such tanks. These periodic tank maintenance requirements may result in significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our storage tanks. 

States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines but most are certified by the DOT to assume responsibility for enforcing intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. For example, in Texas the Pipeline Safety Department of the TRRC inspects and enforces the pipeline safety regulations for intrastate pipelines, including gathering lines. States may adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines; however, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. State standards may include more stringent requirements for facility design and management in addition to requirements for pipelines. We do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state 

&#160;

laws and regulations. Our pipelines have ongoing inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements. 

We have incorporated all existing requirements into our programs by the required regulatory deadlines and are continually incorporating the new requirements into procedures and budgets. We expect to incur increasing regulatory compliance costs, based on the intensification of the regulatory environment and upcoming changes to regulations as outlined above. In addition to regulatory changes, costs may be incurred when there is an accidental release of a commodity gathered on our system, or a regulatory inspection identifies a deficiency in our required programs. 

Other Laws and Regulation 

We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;), and comparable state laws. These laws and the implementing regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communications standard, OSHA Process Safety Management, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state laws require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements. 

Our operations in Texas are subject to the rules and regulations of the Railroad Commission of Texas, Oil &#38; Gas Division. Our operations in Louisiana are subject to the rules and regulations of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, Office of Conservation. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these rules and regulations. 

We believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our current operations and that our continued compliance with existing requirements should not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2015, we had no accrued environmental obligations. We are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures or that will otherwise have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. However, we cannot predict how future environmental laws and regulations may impact our operations, and therefore, cannot provide assurance that the passage of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
