Disclosure of reserves 

Summary of oil and gas reserves at year-end 

The table below summarizes the net proved reserves for the company, as at December 31, 2015, as detailed in the &#147;Supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities&#148; part of the Financial section, starting on page 28 of this report. 

All of the company&#146;s reported reserves are located in Canada. The company has reported proved reserves based on the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month during the last 12-month period ending December 31. Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels. When crude oil and natural gas prices are in the range seen in late 2015 and early 2016 for an extended period of time, under the United States Securities and Exchange Commission&#146;s (SEC) definition of proved reserves, certain quantities of oil and natural gas could temporarily not qualify as proved reserves. Otherwise, no major discovery or other favourable or adverse event has occurred since December 31, 2015 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date.

NGL proved reserves are not material and are therefore included under liquids. The estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines. Furthermore, the company only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves. Although the company is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors, including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, royalty framework and significant changes in projections of long-term oil and gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the company&#146;s capital spending and also impact our partners&#146; capacity to fund their share of joint projects. 

When crude oil and natural gas prices are in the range seen in late 2015 and early 2016 for an extended period of time, under the SEC definition of proved reserves, certain quantities of oil and natural gas, such as oil sands operations, could temporarily not qualify as proved reserves. Amounts required to be de-booked as proved reserves on an SEC basis are subject to being re-booked as proved reserves at some point in the future when price levels recover. Under the terms of certain contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, lower prices can also increase proved reserves attributable to the company. It is not expected that any temporary changes in reported proved reserves under SEC definitions would affect the operation of the underlying projects or alter the outlook for future production volumes. 

Technologies used in establishing proved reserves estimates 

Imperial&#146;s proved reserves in 2015 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results. 

Data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements, including high-quality 3-D and 4-D seismic data, calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software, proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software and commercially available data analysis packages. 

&#160;

In some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates. 

Preparation of reserves estimates 

Imperial has a dedicated reserves management group that is separate from the base operating organization. Primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with the SEC rules and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of Imperial&#146;s proved reserves. This group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for Imperial&#146;s proved reserves. In addition, this group provides training to personnel involved in the reserve estimation and reporting processes within Imperial. 

The reserves management group maintains a central database containing the official company reserves estimates. Appropriate controls, including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database. An annual review of the system&#146;s controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance and a rigorous peer review. No changes may be made to reserves estimates in the central database, including the addition of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless those changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the base operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and endorsement by the operating organization and the reserves management group, culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management and the company&#146;s board of directors. 

The Operations Technical Subsurface Engineering Manager is a professional engineer registered in Alberta, Canada and has over 30 years of petroleum industry experience, including 22 years of reserves related experience. The position provides leadership to the internal reserves management group and is responsible for filing a reserves report with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities. The company&#146;s internal reserves evaluation staff consists of 47 persons with an average of 14 years of relevant technical experience in evaluating reserves, of whom 31 persons are qualified reserves evaluators for purposes of Canadian securities regulatory requirements. The company&#146;s internal reserves evaluation management team is made up of 17 persons with an average of 14 years of relevant experience in evaluating and managing the evaluation of reserves. No independent qualified reserves evaluator or auditor was involved in the preparation of the company&#146;s reserves data. 

Pr oved undeveloped reserves 

As at December 31, 2015, approximately 12 percent of the company&#146;s proved reserves were proved undeveloped reserves reflecting volumes of 513 million oil-equivalent barrels. Nearly all of those undeveloped reserves are associated with the Cold Lake field. This compared to 1,704 million oil-equivalent barrels of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2014. Decreased proved undeveloped bitumen reserves in 2015 were largely due to the start-up of the Kearl expansion project, resulting in a transfer of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. 

The remaining proved undeveloped reserves are associated with ongoing drilling programs, mainly at Cold Lake. Proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more are primarily associated with Cold Lake&#146;s ongoing drilling program and were not material compared to the company&#146;s total proved reserves. 

One of the company&#146;s requirements to report resources as proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments towards the development of the reserves. The company has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require a long lead-time in order to be developed. The company made investments of about $2.4 billion during the year to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves, principally the Kearl expansion project.

&#160;

In 2014, the following wells were drilled to add productive capacity: 90 development wells at Cold Lake, of which 74 development wells relate to the Cold Lake Nabiye expansion project, eight net tight gas wells and 13 net other wells. 

In 2013, the following wells were drilled to add productive capacity: 120 development wells at the Cold Lake Nabiye expansion project, 34 net tight oil development wells and three net other wells. 

Wells drilling 

At December 31, 2015, the company was participating in the drilling of the following exploratory and development wells. All wells were located in Canada.

&#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; Exploratory and development activities regarding oil and gas resources 

Cold Lake 

In February 2012, the Nabiye expansion at Cold Lake was sanctioned. Facilities start-up occurred throughout December 2014 followed by initial steam injection into the reservoir in January 2015. Bitumen production commenced February 2015. 

To maintain production at Cold Lake, additional wells were drilled on existing phases in 2015. 

The company also conducts experimental pilot operations to improve recovery of bitumen from wells by means of new drilling, production and recovery techniques. 

Mackenzie Delta 

In 1999, the company and three other companies entered into an agreement to study the feasibility of developing Mackenzie Delta gas, anchored by three large onshore natural gas fields. The company retains a 100 percent interest in the largest of these fields. 

In late 2010, the National Energy Board (NEB) announced its approval of plans to build and operate the project subject to 264 conditions in areas such as engineering, safety and environmental protection. Federal cabinet approved the project in early 2011. 

The commercial viability of these natural gas resources, and the pipeline required to transport this natural gas to markets, is dependent on a number of factors. These factors include natural gas markets, continued support from northern parties, fiscal framework and the cost of constructing, operating and abandoning the field production and pipeline facilities. 

In 2015, the company applied to the NEB and the Government of Northwest Territories (GNWT) for an extension of the pipeline and gathering system construction permits. The NEB and GNWT provided a nine month extension to the permits while they consider the extension request. No final investment decision has been made. 

Beaufort Sea 

In 2007, the company acquired a 50 percent interest in an exploration licence in the Beaufort Sea. As part of the evaluation, a 3-D seismic survey was conducted in 2008 and the company has since carried out data collection programs to support environmental studies and safe exploration drilling operations. 

In 2010, the company executed an agreement to cross-convey interests with another company to acquire a 25 percent interest in an additional Beaufort Sea exploration licence. As a result of that agreement, the company operates both licences and its interest in the original licence was reduced to 25 percent. The exploration licences are held through 2019 and 2020, respectively. 

In 2013, the company and its joint venture partners filed a project description, initiating the formal regulatory review of the project. Current activities continue to focus on data gathering, regulatory groundwork, and community consultation. No final drilling investment decision has been made. 

&#160;

Other oil sands activity 

The company filed a regulatory application for a new in-situ oil sands project at Aspen in December 2013, using steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) technology to develop the project in three phases producing about 45,000 barrels per day before royalties, per phase. 

In 2015, the company amended the regulatory application to develop the project using solvent-assisted, steam-assisted gravity drainage (SA-SAGD) technology. The technology significantly improves capital efficiency and lowers greenhouse gas intensity versus the existing SAGD technologies. The project is proposed to be executed in two phases producing about 75,000 barrels per day before royalties, per phase. Development timing is subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions. No final investment decision has been made. 

Work continues on technical evaluations to support potential Cold Lake Grand Rapids, Corner and Clyden in-situ development regulatory applications. 

The company also has interests in other oil sands leases in the Athabasca and Peace River areas of northern Alberta. Evaluation wells completed on these leased areas established the presence of bitumen. The company continues to evaluate these leases to determine their potential for future development. 

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) activity 

WCC LNG Ltd., jointly owned by the company (20 percent) and ExxonMobil Canada Ltd. (80 percent), was granted an export licence in 2013 for up to 30 million tonnes of LNG per year for a period of 25 years. The project is proceeding through the pre-application phase in a B.C. environmental assessment process. No final investment decision has been made. 

Exploratory and development activities regarding oil and gas resources extracted by mining methods 

Kearl 

Kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen, which is processed through extraction and froth treatment trains. The company holds a 70.96 percent participating interest in the joint venture and ExxonMobil Canada Properties holds the other 29.04 percent. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to certain of the company&#146;s refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate transportation by pipeline and rail. 

The Kearl expansion project was completed and started-up in the second quarter of 2015, adding an additional 110,000 barrels of bitumen per day before royalties, of which the company&#146;s share is about 78,000 barrels per day. 

Potential future debottlenecking of both the initial development and expansion would increase output to reach the regulatory capacity of 345,000 barrels of bitumen per day, of which the company&#146;s share would be about 245,000 barrels per day. Such debottlenecking remains under evaluation. 

Other oil sands activity 

The company is continuing to evaluate other undeveloped, mineable oil sands acreage in the Athabasca region. 

&#160;

Present activities 

Review of principal ongoing activities 

Cold Lake 

Cold Lake is an in-situ heavy oil bitumen operation. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to certain of the company&#146;s refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. 

During 2015, net production at Cold Lake was about 139,000 barrels per day and gross production was about 158,000 barrels per day. 

The Province of Alberta, in its capacity as lessor of Cold Lake oil sands leases, is entitled to a royalty on production at Cold Lake. Royalties are subject to the oil sands royalty regulations and are based upon a sliding scale determined largely by the price of crude oil. 

Kearl 

During 2015, the company&#146;s share of Kearl&#146;s net bitumen production was about 106,000 barrels per day and gross production was about 108,000 barrels per day.

The company holds a 25 percent participating interest in the joint venture. The produced synthetic crude oil is shipped to certain of the company&#146;s refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. 

In 2015, the company&#146;s share of Syncrude&#146;s net production of synthetic crude oil was about 58,000 barrels per day and gross production was about 62,000 barrels per day. 

Effective January 1, 2009, the Syncrude Crown Royalty Agreement was amended. Under the amended agreement, starting in 2010 and through 2015, Syncrude paid the existing Crown royalty rates plus an incremental royalty, the amount of which was subject to minimum production thresholds, before transitioning to the new generic royalty framework in 2016. Syncrude&#146;s royalty is based on bitumen value with upgrading costs and revenues excluded from the calculation. 

Conventional oil and gas 

The Norman Wells oil field in the Northwest Territories is the company&#146;s largest conventional oil producing asset. During 2015, average net production was about 10,000 barrels per day and gross production was about 11,000 barrels per day, currently accounting for about 70 percent of the company&#146;s gross production of conventional crude oil. 

Delivery commitments 

The company has no material commitments to provide a fixed and determinable quantity of oil or gas under existing contracts and agreements.

Western provinces 

The company&#146;s bitumen leases include about 193,000 net acres of oil sands leases near Cold Lake and an area of about 34,000 net acres at Kearl. The company also has about 80,000 net acres of undeveloped, mineable oil sands acreage in the Athabasca region. In addition, the company has interests in other bitumen oil sands leases in the Athabasca areas totalling about 193,000 net acres, which include about 62,000 net acres of oil sands leases in the Clyden area. These 193,000 net acres are amenable to in-situ recovery techniques. 

The company&#146;s share of Syncrude joint venture leases covering about 63,000 net acres accounts for the entire synthetic oil acreage. 

Oil sands leases have an exploration period of fifteen years and are continued beyond that point by meeting the minimum level of evaluation, payment of escalating rentals, or by production. The majority of the acreage in Cold Lake, Kearl and Syncrude is continued by production. 

The company holds interests in an additional 1,214,000 net acres of developed and undeveloped land in western Canada related to crude oil and natural gas. 

Petroleum and natural gas leases and licences from western provinces have exploration periods ranging from two to 15 years and are continued beyond that point by production. 

Canada lands 

Land holdings in Canada lands primarily include exploration licence (EL) acreage in the Beaufort Sea of about 252,000 net acres and in the Summit Creek area of central Mackenzie Valley totalling about 222,000 net acres and significant discovery licence (SDL) acreage in the Mackenzie Delta and Beaufort Sea areas of about 183,000 net acres. 

Exploration licences on Canada lands and Atlantic offshore have a finite term. If a significant discovery is made, a SDL may be granted that holds the acreage under the SDL indefinitely, subject to certain conditions. 

The company&#146;s net acreage in Canada lands is either continued by production or held through exploration licences and SDLs. 

Atlantic offshore 

The Atlantic offshore acreage is continued by production or held by SDLs. 

&#160;

Downstream 

Supply 

The company supplements its own production of crude oil, condensate and petroleum products with substantial purchases from a number of other sources at freely negotiated prices. Purchases are made under both spot and term contracts from domestic and foreign sources, including Exxon Mobil Corporation. 

Transportation 

Imperial currently transports the company&#146;s crude oil production and third party crude oil required to supply refineries by contracted pipelines, common carrier pipelines and rail. To mitigate uncertainty associated with the timing of industry pipeline projects and pipeline capacity constraints, the company has developed rail infrastructure. The Edmonton rail terminal commenced operation in the second quarter of 2015 and has capacity to ship up to 210,000 barrels per day of crude oil. 

Refining 

The company owns and operates three refineries, which process predominantly Canadian crude oil. The Strathcona refinery operates lubricating oil production facilities. In addition to crude oil, the company purchases finished products to supplement its refinery production. 

In 2015, capital expenditures of about $84 million were made at the company&#146;s refineries. Capital expenditures focused mainly on refinery projects to improve reliability, feedstock flexibility, energy efficiency and environmental performance. 

The approximate average daily volumes of refinery throughput during the three years ended December 31, 2015, and the daily rated capacities of the refineries as at December 31, 2015 were as follows.

Accordingly, actual capacities may be higher or lower than rated capacities due to changes in refinery operation and the type of crude oil available for processing. &#160; (c) Refinery operations at the Dartmouth refinery were discontinued on September 16, 2013. In 2015, refinery throughput was 92 percent of capacity, 2 percent lower than the previous year. The lower rate was primarily a result of planned maintenance. 

In 2014, refinery throughput was 94 percent of capacity, 6 percent higher than the previous year. The higher rate was primarily a result of improved reliability and increased product sales. 

Distribution 

The company maintains a nationwide distribution system, to handle bulk and packaged petroleum products moving from refineries to market by pipeline, tanker, rail and road transport. The company owns and operates natural gas liquids and products pipelines in Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario and has interests in the capital stock of one crude oil and two products pipeline companies. 

&#160;

Marketing 

The company markets petroleum products throughout Canada under well-known brand names, most notably Esso and Mobil, to all types of customers. 

The company sells to the motoring public through Esso retail service stations. On average during the year, there were more than 1,700 retail service stations, of which about 470 were company-owned or leased, but none of which were company operated. The remaining approximately 1,250 Esso branded service stations operate under a branded wholesaler model. The company continues to improve its Esso retail service station network, providing customer services such as car washes and convenience stores, primarily at high volume sites in urban centres. 

In January 2015, the company announced that it will evaluate its operating model for the company-owned retail stations. The company is evaluating ways of extending the branded wholesaler operating model to the remaining company-owned retail stations as part of Imperial&#146;s Esso branded growth strategy. 

Imperial sells petroleum products to large industrial and transportation customers, independent marketers, resellers as well as other refiners. The company serves agriculture, residential heating and commercial markets through branded resellers. 

The approximate daily volumes of net petroleum products (excluding purchases/sales contracts with the same counterparty) sold during the three years ended December 31, 2015, are set out in the following table.

Research 

In 2015, the company&#146;s total gross research expenditures, before credits, were about $195 million, as compared with $175 million in 2014, and $199 million in 2013. Research expenditures are mainly for developing technologies to improve bitumen recovery, reduce costs, reduce the environmental impact of Upstream operations, supporting environmental and process improvements in the refineries, as well as accessing ExxonMobil&#146;s research worldwide. 

The company has scientific research agreements with affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, which provide for technical and engineering work to be performed by all parties, the exchange of technical information and the assignment and licensing of patents and patent rights. These agreements provide mutual access to scientific and operating data related to nearly every phase of the petroleum and petrochemical operations of the parties. 

&#160;

Environmental protection 

The company regards protecting the environment in connection with its various operations a priority. The company works in cooperation with government agencies, industry associations and communities to address existing, and to anticipate potential, environmental protection issues. In the past five years, the company has made capital and operating expenditures of about $6.1 billion on environmental protection and facilities. In 2015, the company&#146;s environmental capital and operating expenditures totalled approximately $1.2 billion, which was spent primarily on water and tailings treatment and emission reductions at company-owned facilities and Syncrude and remediation of idled facilities and operations. Capital and operating expenditures relating to environmental protection are expected to be about $0.9 billion in 2016.

Career employees are defined as active executive, management, professional, technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for the company and are covered by the company&#146;s benefit plans. The increase in career employees in 2015 is primarily associated with the company&#146;s start-up of the Kearl expansion project. About 7 percent of the company&#146;s employees are members of unions. 

Competition 

The Canadian petroleum, natural gas and chemical industries are highly competitive. Competition exists in the search for and development of new sources of supply, the construction and operation of crude oil, natural gas and refined products pipelines and facilities and the refining, distribution and marketing of petroleum products and chemicals. The petroleum industry also competes with other industries in supplying energy, fuel and other needs of consumers. 

Government regulation 

Petroleum and natural gas rights 

Most of the company&#146;s petroleum and natural gas rights were acquired from governments, either federal or provincial. These rights in the form of leases or licences are generally acquired for cash or work commitments. A lease or licence entitles the holder to explore for petroleum and/or natural gas on the leased lands for a specified period. 

In western provinces, the lease holder can produce the petroleum or natural gas discovered on the leased lands and retains the rights based on continued production. Oil sands leases are retained by meeting the minimum level of evaluation, payment of rentals, or by production. 

The holder of a licence relating to Canada lands and the Atlantic offshore can apply for a SDL if a discovery is made. If granted, the SDL holds the lands indefinitely subject to certain conditions. The holder may then apply for a production licence in order to produce petroleum or natural gas from the licenced land. 

Crude oil 

Production 

The maximum allowable gross production of crude oil from wells in Canada is subject to limitation by various regulatory authorities on the basis of engineering and conservation principles. 

Exports 

Export contracts of more than one year for light crude oil and petroleum products and two years for heavy crude oil (including crude bitumen) require the prior approval of the NEB and the Government of Canada. 

Natural gas 

Production 

The maximum allowable gross production of natural gas from wells in Canada is subject to limitations by various regulatory authorities. These limitations are to ensure oil recovery is not adversely impacted by accelerated gas production practices. These limitations do not impact gas reserves, only the timing of production of the reserves and did not have a significant impact on 2015 gas production rates. 

&#160;

Exports 

The Government of Canada has the authority to regulate the export price for natural gas and has a gas export pricing policy, which accommodates export prices for natural gas negotiated between Canadian exporters and U.S. importers. 

Exports of natural gas from Canada require approval by the NEB and the Government of Canada. The Government of Canada allows the export of natural gas by NEB order without volume limitation for terms not exceeding 24 months. 

Royalties 

The Government of Canada and the provinces in which the company produces crude oil and natural gas impose royalties on production from lands where they own the mineral rights. Some producing provinces also receive revenue by imposing taxes on production from lands where they do not own the mineral rights. 

Different royalties are imposed by the Government of Canada and each of the producing provinces. Royalties imposed on crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids vary depending on a number of parameters, including well production volumes, selling prices and recovery methods. For information with respect to royalties for Cold Lake, Syncrude and Kearl, see &#147;Upstream&#148; section under Item 1. 

Investment Canada Act 

The Investment Canada Act requires Government of Canada approval, in certain cases, of the acquisition of control of a Canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by Canadians. The acquisition of natural resource properties may, in certain circumstances, be considered a transaction that constitutes an acquisition of control of a Canadian business requiring Government of Canada approval. 

The Act also requires notification of the establishment of new unrelated businesses in Canada by entities not controlled by Canadians, but does not require Government of Canada approval except when the new business is related to Canada&#146;s cultural heritage or national identity. The Government of Canada is also authorized to take any measures that it considers advisable to protect national security, including the outright prohibition of a foreign investment in Canada. By virtue of the majority stock ownership of the company by Exxon Mobil Corporation, the company is considered to be an entity which is not controlled by Canadians. 

Competition Act 

The Competition Bureau ensures that Canadian businesses and consumers prosper in a competitive and innovative marketplace. The Competition Bureau is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Competition Act (the Act). A merger transaction, whether or not notifiable, is subject to examination by the Commissioner of the Competition Bureau to determine whether the merger will have or is likely to have, the effect of preventing or lessening substantially, competition in a definable market. The assessment of the competitive effects of a merger is made with reference to the factors identified under the Act. 

An Advance Ruling Certificate (ARC) may be issued by the Commissioner to a party or parties to a proposed merger transaction who want to be assured that the transaction will not give rise to proceedings under section 92 of the Act. Section 102 of the Act provides that an ARC may be issued when the Commissioner is satisfied that there would not be sufficient grounds on which to apply to the Competition Tribunal for an order against a proposed merger. The issuance of an ARC is discretionary. An ARC cannot be issued for a transaction that has been completed, nor does an ARC ensure approval of the transaction by any agency other than the Competition Bureau.
