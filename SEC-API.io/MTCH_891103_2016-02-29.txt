OVERVIEW 

Who We Are 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;IAC is a leading media and Internet company comprised of some of the world's most recognized brands and products, such as HomeAdvisor, Vimeo, About.com, Dictionary.com, The Daily Beast, Investopedia, and Match Group's online dating portfolio, which includes Match, OkCupid, Tinder and PlentyOfFish. During the fourth quarter of 2015, IAC realigned itself into the following six reportable segments: Match Group, HomeAdvisor, Publishing, Applications, Video and Other. 

&#32;&#32;For information regarding the results of operations of IAC&#8217;s segments, as well as their respective contributions to IAC&#8217;s consolidated results of operations, see &#8220;Item 7-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Item 8-Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

All references to &#8220;IAC,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221; in this report are to IAC/InterActiveCorp. 

Our History 

IAC, initially a hybrid media/electronic retailing company, was incorporated in 1986 in Delaware under the name Silver King Broadcasting Company, Inc. After several name changes (first to HSN, Inc., then to USA Networks, Inc., USA Interactive and InterActiveCorp, and finally, to IAC/InterActiveCorp) and the completion of a number of significant corporate transactions over the years, the Company transformed itself into a leading media and Internet company. 

From 1997 through 2002, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Ticketmaster Group, Hotel Reservations Network (later renamed Hotels.com) and Expedia, as well as acquired Match.com and other smaller e-commerce companies. In 2002, the Company contributed its entertainment assets to Vivendi Universal Entertainment LLLP, a joint venture, and sold its interests in that venture to NBC Universal in 2005. 

In 2003, the Company continued to grow its portfolio of e-commerce companies by acquiring all of the shares of Expedia, Hotels.com and Ticketmaster that it did not previously own, together with a number of other e-commerce companies (including LendingTree and Hotwire). 

In 2005, IAC acquired Ask Jeeves, Inc. and completed the separation of its travel and travel&#8209;related businesses and investments into an independent public company called Expedia, Inc. In 2008, IAC separated into five publicly traded companies: IAC, HSN, Inc., Interval Leisure Group, Inc., Ticketmaster and Tree.com, Inc. 

In 2009, we sold the European operations of Match.com to Meetic S.A. (now known as Meetic S.A.S. (&#8220;Meetic&#8221;)), a leading European online dating company based in France, in exchange for a 27% interest in Meetic and a &#8364;5 million note. In 2010, we exchanged the stock of a wholly-owned subsidiary that held our Evite, Gifts.com and IAC Advertising Solutions businesses and approximately $218 million in cash for substantially all of Liberty Media Corporation&#8217;s equity stake in IAC. 

In 2011, we increased our ownership stake in Meetic to 81%. In 2012, we acquired About.com. 

In 2014, we acquired the remaining publicly traded shares of Meetic, ValueClick&#8217;s &#8220;owned and operated&#8221; website businesses, including Investopedia and PriceRunner, and The Princeton Review. 

In 2015, we acquired Plentyoffish Media Inc., a leading provider of subscription-based and ad-supported online personals servicing North America, Europe, Latin America and Australia, for $575 million in cash, and completed the initial public offering of Match Group, Inc. 

EQUITY OWNERSHIP AND VOTE 

IAC has outstanding shares of common stock, with one vote per share, and Class B common stock, with ten votes per share and which are convertible into common stock on a share for share basis. As of January 29, 2016, Mr. Diller, IAC&#8217;s Chairman and Senior Executive, owned 5,789,499 shares of IAC Class B common stock and 136,711 shares of IAC common stock. As of this date, Mr. Diller had sole voting and sole investment power with respect to these IAC securities and the shares of IAC Class B common stock held by Mr. Diller represented 100% of IAC&#8217;s outstanding Class B common stock and, together with the shares of IAC common stock held by Mr. Diller, represented approximately 42.9% of the total outstanding voting power of IAC. Mr. Diller also holds 300,000 vested options and 1,000,000 unvested options to purchase IAC common stock. 

&#32;On February 22, 2016, in connection with the long-term estate planning of Mr. Diller and his family, Mr. Diller: (i) transferred an aggregate of 136,711 shares of IAC common stock and 5,248,598 shares of IAC Class B common stock to two grantor retained annuity trusts, over which Mr. Diller has sole investment power and Mr. Diller&#8217;s spouse, Diane von Furstenberg, has sole voting power (the &#8220;2016 GRATs&#8221;); and (ii) transferred 540,901 shares of IAC Class B common stock to a trust for the benefit of certain of his family members (the &#8220;2016 Family Trust&#8221;), over which Mr. Diller&#8217;s stepson, Alexander von Furstenberg, has sole voting and sole investment power. 

In addition, pursuant to an amended and restated governance agreement between IAC and Mr. Diller, for so long as Mr. Diller serves as IAC&#8217;s Chairman and Senior Executive and he beneficially owns (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) at least 5,000,000 shares of IAC Class B common stock and/or common stock in which he has a pecuniary interest (including by way of sole investment power over the IAC securities in the 2016 GRATs), he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that IAC&#8217;s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve-month period. 

As a result of Mr. Diller&#8217;s sole investment power over the IAC securities in the 2016 GRATs, Ms. von Furstenberg&#8217;s sole voting power over the IAC securities in the 2016 GRATs, Mr. von Furstenberg&#8217;s sole voting and sole investment power over the IAC securities in the 2016 Family Trust and Mr. Diller&#8217;s contractual rights described above, Mr. Diller and his family are, collectively, currently in a position to influence, subject to our organizational documents and Delaware law, the composition of IAC&#8217;s Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions. 

DESCRIPTION OF IAC BUSINESSES 

Match Group 

Overview 

Our Match Group segment includes the dating and non-dating businesses of Match Group, Inc. (&#8220;Match Group&#8221;), which completed its initial public offering on November 24, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, IAC&#8217;s ownership interest and voting interest in Match Group were 84.6% and 98.2%, respectively. 

Services 

Dating. &#32;Through Match Group, we operate a dating business that consists of a portfolio with over 45 brands, available in 38 languages, and offered in over 190 countries, including the following key brands: Match, OkCupid, PlentyOfFish, Tinder, Meetic, Twoo, OurTime, BlackPeopleMeet and FriendScout24. We operate a North America dating business, which includes Match, Chemistry, People Media, PlentyOfFish, OkCupid, Tinder and other dating businesses operating within the United States and Canada, and an International dating business, which includes Meetic, the international operations of PlentyOfFish and Tinder and all other dating businesses operating outside of the United States and Canada. 

All of our dating products enable a user to establish a profile and review other people&#8217;s profiles without charge. Each of them also offers additional features, some of which are free, and some of which require payment depending on the particular product. In general, access to premium features requires a paid membership, which is typically offered in packages from one month to 12 months, depending on the product and circumstance. Prices differ meaningfully within a given brand by the duration of membership purchased, by the bundle of paid features that a user chooses to access, and by whether or not a customer is taking advantage of any special offers. In addition to paid memberships, many of our dating products, such as Match, Meetic and OkCupid, offer users the ability to promote themselves for a given period of time, or to review certain profiles without any signaling to other members, and these features are offered on a pay&#8209;per&#8209;use basis. The precise mix of paid and premium features is established over time on a brand&#8209;by&#8209;brand basis and is constantly subject to iteration and evolution. 

Non-Dating. In addition to our dating business, we also operate a non&#8209;dating business through Match Group&#8217;s ownership of The Princeton Review, which provides a variety of educational test preparation, academic tutoring and college counseling services. The Princeton Review includes Tutor.com (acquired in 2012) and The Princeton Review (acquired in 2014). 

Revenue 

Substantially all of the Match Group segment&#8217;s revenue is attributable to the dating business and substantially all dating revenue is derived directly from users. The significant majority of that revenue comes from recurring membership fees, which typically provide unlimited access to a bundle of features for a specific period of time, and the balance from &#224; la carte features, where users pay a fee for a specific action or event. Each brand offers a combination of free and paid features targeted to its unique community. In addition to direct revenue from users, dating revenue is derived from online advertising. Substantially all of non-dating revenue is derived directly from students. 

Marketing 

We attract the majority of users of our dating products through word&#8209;of&#8209;mouth and other free channels. In addition, many of our brands rely on paid customer acquisition for a significant percentage of their users. Our online marketing activities generally consist of purchasing banner and other display advertising, search engine marketing, e-mail campaigns and business development or partnership deals. Our offline marketing activities generally consist of television advertising and related public relations efforts, as well as events. 

Competition 

The dating industry is competitive and has no single, dominant brand. We compete primarily with other companies that provide similar dating and matchmaking products, including eHarmony, Spark Networks (Jdate, ChristianMingle), Zoosk, Parship, ElitePartner, e&#8209;Darling and Badoo. 

In addition to other online dating brands, we compete indirectly with offline dating services, such as in&#8209;person matchmakers, and social media platforms. Arguably, our biggest competition in the case of our dating business comes from the traditional ways that people meet each other, and the choices some people make to not utilize dating products or services. 

We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the case of our dating business will depend primarily upon the following factors: 

&#8226; 

our ability to increase consumer acceptance of dating products; 

&#8226; 

the continued strength of Match Group&#8217;s brands; 

&#8226; 

the breadth and depth of Match Group&#8217;s active communities of users relative to its competitors; 

&#8226; 

our ability to evolve our dating products in response to competitors&#8217; offerings, user requirements, social trends and the technological landscape; 

&#8226; 

our ability to efficiently acquire new users for our dating products; 

&#8226; 

our ability to continue to optimize our monetization strategies; and 

&#8226; 

the design and functionality of our dating products. 

HomeAdvisor 

Overview 

HomeAdvisor is a leading nationwide home services digital marketplace that helps connect consumers with home professionals in the United States, as well as in France and the Netherlands under various brands. HomeAdvisor connects consumers, by way of proprietary and patented technologies, with home services professionals, most of whom are pre-screened and customer&#8209;rated. 

As of December 31, 2015, HomeAdvisor&#8217;s domestic network of home services professionals consisted of approximately 102,000 paying service professionals in the United States providing services in more than 500 categories ranging from simple home repairs to larger home remodeling projects. HomeAdvisor generated 9.8 million domestic service requests from homeowners during the year ended December 31, 2015. HomeAdvisor also operates Felix, a pay-per-call advertising service, and mHelpDesk, a provider of cloud based field service software for small to mid-size businesses. 

Consumer Services 

Matching Services. When a consumer submits a request through the HomeAdvisor marketplace, we generally match that consumer with up to four home services professionals from our network based on the type of services desired and the consumer&#8217;s location. Consumers can then review profiles of home services professionals with whom they have been matched and select the professional whom they believe best meets their specific needs. In addition to (or in lieu of) submitting a request through our marketplace, consumers can also search, select and contact home service professionals directly through our online directory. In all cases, the consumer is under no obligation to work with home service professionals referred by or found through HomeAdvisor. 

On-Demand Services. In 2015, HomeAdvisor introduced two on-demand services to complement its matching services: Instant Booking and Instant Connect (patent-pending). Through Instant Booking, consumers can schedule appointments for select home tasks on-demand with a pre-screened home professional instantly across our platforms (website or mobile application), and through Instant Connect, consumers can connect with a home service professional instantly via phone. 

Other Services. In addition to matching and on-demand services, consumers can access our free, online CostGuide, which provides project cost information for more than 250 project types on a local basis, as well as an online library of service&#8209;related resources, which primarily includes articles about home improvement, repair and maintenance, tools to assist consumers with the research, planning and management of their projects and general advice for working with home services professionals. 

Consumers can also access all HomeAdvisor services and tools on iOS and Android devices, including the Apple Watch &#174; , through HomeAdvisor's mobile application. 

Subscription Services for Home Services Professionals 

&#32;We offer various annual subscription products for home services professionals. The basic membership package includes membership in our network of home services professionals, as well as a listing in our online directory. Additional membership packages include all of the basic membership package services, plus matches through the marketplace and, in the case of one package, custom website and mobile development and hosting services, as well as integration with mHelpDesk. 

Home services professionals who are new to HomeAdvisor must generally sign up for one of the annual subscription products described above. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 93% of the approximately 102,000 domestic paying service professionals within our network had purchased a membership package. 

Revenue 

The HomeAdvisor segment&#8217;s revenue is primarily derived from fees paid by home services professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the professional ultimately provides the requested service), subscription fees and fees for website hosting services. Fees for matches vary based upon the service requested and where the service is provided. 

Marketing 

&#32;We market our services to consumers primarily through television advertising, as well as search engine marketing and through affiliate agreements with third parties. Pursuant to these agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote our services and those of our home services professionals on their websites and we agree to pay them a fixed fee when visitors from their websites submit a valid service request through our website (on a cost-per-acquisition basis) or click through to our website (on a cost-per-click basis). We also market our services to consumers through e-mails, digital display advertisements, partnerships with other contextually related websites and, to a lesser extent, through direct mail and radio advertising. We market our subscription packages to home services professionals primarily through our sales force, as well as through search engine marketing, digital media advertising and direct relationships with trade associations. 

Competition 

We compete with home services-related lead generation services, as well as Internet search engines and directories and with other forms of local advertising, including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages, newspapers and other offline directories. We also compete with local and national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation services. We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors: 

&#8226; 

the size, quality (as determined, in part, by reference to our pre-screening efforts and customer ratings and reviews), diversity and stability of our network of home services professionals and the quality of the services they provide; 

&#8226; 

our continued ability to deliver service requests that convert into revenue for our network of home services professionals in a cost-effective manner; 

&#8226; 

whether our subscription products resonate with (and provide value to) our home services professionals; 

&#8226; 

the functionality of our websites and mobile applications and the attractiveness of their features and our services generally to consumers and home services professionals, as well as our ability to introduce new products and services that resonate with consumers and home services professionals; and 

&#8226; 

our ability to build and maintain awareness of (and loyalty to) the HomeAdvisor brand. 

Publishing 

Overview 

Our Publishing segment consists of: 

&#8226; 

our Premium Brands business, which includes About.com, Dictionary.com, Investopedia and The Daily Beast; and 

&#8226; 

our Ask &#38; Other business, which includes Ask.com, CityGrid, ASKfm and a labs division focused on accelerating growth for the portfolio of websites within the Publishing segment and incubating new digital publishing sites in emerging verticals. 

Our Publishing businesses publish digital content and/or provide search services to users. Those of our Publishing businesses that publish digital content (our Premium Brands) generate such content through various sources, including, for example, through a network of approximately 850 &#8220;experts&#8221; as of December 31, 2015 in the case of About.com and internal editorial staff in the case of The Daily Beast, and/or acquire such content (or the rights to publish such content) from third parties. Those of our Publishing businesses that provide search services (Ask &#38; Other businesses and About.com, Dictionary.com and Investopedia through search boxes embedded within their websites) generally generate and display of a set of algorithmic search results, or hyperlinks to websites deemed relevant to search queries entered by users. In addition to these algorithmic search results, paid listings are also generally displayed in response to search queries. Paid listings are advertisements displayed on search results pages that generally contain a link to advertiser websites. Paid listings are generally displayed based on keywords selected by advertisers. The paid listings displayed by our Publishing businesses are supplied to us by Google Inc. (&#8220;Google&#8221;) pursuant to a services agreement, which expires on March 31, 2016. Following the expiration of this agreement, a new services agreement with Google, which expires on March 31, 2020, will take effect. The Company may choose to terminate this agreement effective March 31, 2019. 

Premium Brands 

Our Premium Brands business primarily consists of the following destination websites: 

&#8226; 

About.com, which provides detailed information and content written by independent, freelance subject matter experts across hundreds of vertical categories; 

&#8226; 

Dictionary.com, which primarily provides online and mobile dictionary, thesaurus and reference services; 

&#8226; 

Investopedia, a resource for investment and personal finance education and information; and 

&#8226; 

The Daily Beast, a website dedicated to news, commentary, culture and entertainment that curates and publishes existing and original online content from its own roster of contributors in the United States. 

Collectively, our Premium Brands business was one of the largest digital publishers in the world during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, having reached more than 100 million U.S. users a month during this period. 

Ask &#38; Other 

Our Ask &#38; Other business consists of: 

&#8226; 

Ask.com, which provides general search services, as well as question and answer services that provide direct answers to natural-language questions; 

&#8226; 

CityGrid, an advertising network that integrates local content and advertising for distribution to affiliated and third party publishers across web and mobile platforms; 

&#8226; 

ASKfm, a questions and answers social network; and 

&#8226; 

a labs division focused on accelerating growth for its portfolio of websites and incubating new digital publishing sites in emerging verticals. 

Revenue 

The Publishing segment's revenue consists principally of advertising revenue, which is generated primarily through the display of paid listings in response to search queries, display advertisements and fees related to paid mobile downloadable applications. The substantial majority of the paid listings that our Publishing businesses display are supplied to us by Google pursuant to our services agreement with Google. 

Pursuant to this agreement, those of our Publishing businesses that provide search services transmit search queries to Google, which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to these businesses for display in search results. This ad-serving process occurs independently of, but concurrently with, the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries. Google paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages. Paid listings are priced on a price per click basis and when a user submits a search query through one of our Publishing businesses and then clicks on a Google paid listing displayed in response to the query, Google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing directly and shares a portion of the fee charged to the advertiser with us. We recognize paid listing revenue from Google when it delivers the user's click. In cases where the user&#8217;s click is generated due to the efforts of a third party distributor, we recognize the amount due from Google as revenue and record a revenue share or other payment obligation to the third party distributor as traffic acquisition costs. See &#8220;Item 1A-Risk Factors-We depend upon arrangements with Google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.&#8221; 

Competition 

We compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to attract and retain users and advertisers to our Publishing businesses. 

In terms of publishing digital content, our competitors include destination websites that primarily acquire traffic through paid and algorithmic search results in relevant vertical categories and social channels. In terms of providing search services, generally our competitors include Google, Yahoo!, Bing and other destination search websites and search&#8209;centric portals (some of which provide a broad range of content and services and/or link to various desktop applications). 

Moreover, some of the current and potential competitors of our Publishing businesses have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger customer bases and/or significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. As a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services, which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us. 

We believe that the ability of our Publishing businesses to compete successfully will depend primarily upon: 

&#8226; 

the quality of the content and features on our various Publishing platforms (websites and mobile applications), and the attractiveness of the services provided by these platforms generally, relative to those of our competitors; 

&#8226; 

our ability to successfully generate and acquire content (or the rights thereto) in a cost-effective manner; 

&#8226; 

the relevance and authority of content, search results and answers; 

&#8226; 

our ability to successfully market the content and search services offered by our Publishing businesses in a cost-effective manner; and 

&#8226; 

our continued ability to differentiate Ask.com from its competitors through question and answer services that endeavors to provide accurate, authoritative and direct answers to natural&#8209;language questions (in the form of algorithmic search results and/or responses from other Ask.com users, as well as indexed question and answer pairings from various websites and online services), as well as our ability to attract advertisers to this initiative. 

Applications 

&#32;Overview 

Our Applications segment consists of: 

&#8226; 

Consumer, which includes our direct-to-consumer downloadable desktop applications, including SlimWare, and Apalon, which houses our mobile applications; and 

&#8226; 

Partnerships, which includes our business-to-business partnership operations. 

&#32;Our Applications businesses provide search services and a variety of utility applications to users. 

Consumer 

Through our Consumer business, we develop, market and distribute a variety of utility applications, or downloadable desktop applications that offer users the ability to access search services, as well as engage in a number of other activities online. The majority of our utility applications are toolbars, which consist of a browser search box and related technology that together enable users to run search queries and otherwise access search services directly from their web browsers. Many of our toolbars are coupled with other applications that we have developed that provide users with access to various forms of content and software capabilities. These applications include: MapsGalaxy , through which users can access accurate street maps, local traffic conditions and aerial and satellite street views; FromDoctoPDF , through which users can convert documents from one format into various others and share them across multiple platforms; TelevisionFanatic , through which users can access and stream free television episodes online for free; and Gaming Wonderland , through which users can access classic arcade, sports and action and other casual games directly from their web browsers. Other utility applications target users with a special or passionate interest in select vertical categories (such as recipes, film and gossip, among others) or provide users with particular reference information or access to specific capabilities (such as weather forecasts and internet speed, among others). We distribute our utility applications directly to consumers free of charge. 

SlimWare is a provider of community-powered software and services that clean, repair, update and optimize personal computers, and Apalon is an award-winning mobile development company with one of the largest and most popular portfolios of mobile applications worldwide. 

Partnerships 

Through our Partnerships business, we work closely with partners in the software, media and other industries to design and develop customized browser&#8209;based search applications to be bundled and distributed with these partners&#8217; products and services. 

Revenue 

Substantially all of the Applications segment's revenue consists of advertising revenue generated principally through the display of paid listings in response to search queries. The substantial majority of the paid listings displayed by our Applications businesses are supplied to us by Google in the manner and pursuant to the services agreement described above under "-Publishing-Revenue." To a significantly lesser extent, the Applications segment's revenue also consists of fees related to subscription downloadable applications, fees related to paid mobile downloadable applications and display advertisements. 

Competition 

We compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to develop, market and distribute applications and related technology directly and through third parties. Competitors of our Applications businesses include Google, Yahoo!, Bing and other third party toolbar, convenience search and applications providers and other search technology and convenience service providers. 

Moreover, some of the current and potential competitors of our Applications businesses have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger customer bases and/or significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. As a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services, which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us. 

We believe that the ability of our Applications businesses to compete successfully will depend primarily upon our continued ability to: 

&#8226; 

create toolbars and other applications that resonate with consumers (which requires that we continue to bundle attractive features, content and services, some of which may be owned by third parties, with quality search services); 

&#8226; 

maintain industry-leading monetization solutions for our applications; 

&#8226; 

differentiate our toolbars and other applications from those of our competitors (primarily through providing customized toolbars and access to multiple search and other services through our toolbars); 

&#8226; 

secure cost-effective distribution arrangements with third parties; and 

&#8226; 

market and distribute our toolbars and other applications directly to consumers in a cost-effective manner. 

Video 

Overview 

Our Video segment consists primarily of Vimeo and DailyBurn, as well as Electus, IAC Films, CollegeHumor and Notional. 

Vimeo 

Services. &#32;&#32;Vimeo operates a global video sharing platform for creators and their audiences. Through Vimeo, we offer video creators simple, professional grade tools to share, distribute and monetize content online, and provide viewers with a clutter-free environment to watch content across a variety of Internet-enabled devices, including mobile devices and connected television platforms. We offer these basic services free of charge. 

We also offer premium services through subscription products, which provide paying subscribers with various levels of premium features, including: additional video storage space, advanced video privacy controls, extensive video player customization options, premium support and the ability to sell videos. As of December 31, 2015, Vimeo had approximately 676,000 paid subscribers and reached over 200 million unique users worldwide. 

We also provide transactional video-on-demand services through Vimeo On Demand, through which video creators can sell videos they create to viewers. As of December 31, 2015, Vimeo On Demand featured approximately 32,000 titles in a variety of genres from nearly 10,000 creators and more than 1,200,000 consumers purchased Vimeo On Demand titles on www.vimeo.com &#32;or on third party websites with an embedded Vimeo On Demand player. Titles are added from video creators by way of direct uploads to www.vimeo.com &#32;and acquired through negotiated agreements with content owners, producers and distributors. 

We also sell custom advertising through our Brand Studio service, which connects advertisers with video creators to produce original, branded videos, which are then presented as brand-sponsored content on www.vimeo.com &#32;and/or the advertiser websites. 

Marketing. &#32;&#32;We market Vimeo&#8217;s services primarily through online marketing efforts, including search engine marketing, e-mail campaigns, display advertising, affiliate marketing and offline advertising (primarily television) and through upgrade channels on the Vimeo platform (website and mobile application). 

Revenue. &#32;&#32;Vimeo revenue is derived primarily from subscription fees and, to a lesser extent, from video distribution and advertising sales. 

Competition. &#32;&#32;Vimeo competes with a variety of online video providers, including those that serve video creators and consumers through advertising-supported, subscription or transactional fee models. We believe that Vimeo differentiates itself from its competitors by offering a customizable, high definition video player, proprietary uploading and encoding infrastructure and a clutter-free viewing experience (advertisements are not placed in video streams). We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily on: 

&#8226; 

the quality of our technology platform and the viewing and production experiences we provide consumers and video creators across Internet-connected devices (desktop, mobile and television); 

&#8226; 

whether our subscription offerings resonate with video creators; 

&#8226; 

our ability to attract high-quality content, both for free and fee-based viewing; 

&#8226; 

the accessibility of our videos on search engines and social media platforms; 

&#8226; 

the recognition and strength of the Vimeo brand relative to those of our competitors; and 

&#8226; 

our ability to drive new subscribers and viewers to our platform through various forms of direct advertising. 

DailyBurn 

Services. &#32;&#32;DailyBurn is a health and fitness property that provides streaming fitness and workout videos across a variety of platforms, including iOS, Android, Xbox and other Internet-enabled television platforms. 

Revenue. &#32;&#32;DailyBurn&#8217;s revenue consists primarily of subscription fees. 

Marketing. We market our streaming fitness and workout videos primarily through television advertising, advertising on ad-supported video-on-demand services and content platforms and search engine marketing. 

Competition. &#32;&#32;The fitness and workout market is highly competitive and barriers to entry, particularly in the case of online platforms, are minimal. We compete primarily with other streaming fitness and workout platforms and, to a lesser extent, fitness and workout DVDs. 

Electus 

Services. &#32;&#32;Through Electus, we provide production and producer services for both unscripted and scripted television, feature film and digital content, primarily for initial sale and distribution in the United States. Our content is distributed on a wide range of platforms, including broadcast television, premium and basic cable television, subscription-based and ad-supported video-on-demand services and through theatrical releases and other outlets. We sell and distribute Electus programming and other content, together with programming and other content developed by third parties, outside of the United States through Electus International. We also work with various brands to integrate their products into, as well as sponsor, Electus content through our Content Marketing team. 

In addition, we operate Electus Digital, which consists of the following websites and properties: CollegeHumor.com, Dorkly.com and WatchLOUD.com; YouTube channels WatchLOUD, Nuevon and Hungry; and Big Breakfast (a production company). The various brands and businesses within Electus Digital specialize in creating content for digital, television and feature film platforms across a variety of genres, as well as provide branded and third party creative production services. Through Electus, we also operate Notional. 

Revenue. &#32;&#32;Electus revenue is derived primarily from media production and distribution and display advertisements. 

Marketing. &#32;&#32;We do not engage in any formal marketing efforts in the case of our production and executive producer services, instead relying on referrals and the quality of our services and projects. For content distribution, we rely on our sales force, referrals and the quality of our services and projects, and for international distribution only, attendance at industry trade shows. In addition, the platforms to which we license our content for distribution market our content through their own independent marketing efforts. Electus Digital attracts users and audience primarily through social media, search engine marketing and affiliate agreements. 

Competition. We compete with entertainment studios, production companies, distribution companies, creative agencies and content websites. We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors: 

&#8226; 

the quality and diversity of our content and the third parties to whom we license our content, as well as the quality of the services provided by licensees of our content; 

&#8226; 

our continued ability to create new content that resonates with licensees and viewers; and 

&#8226; 

our ability to sell integration and sponsorship opportunities for our content.
