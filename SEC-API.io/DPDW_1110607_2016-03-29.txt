Services and Products 

&#160; 

Services. We provide a wide variety of engineering and management services, including the design, installation and retrieval of subsea equipment and systems, connection and termination operations, well-commissioning services, as well as construction support and Remotely Operated Vehicle (&#8220;ROV&#8221;) operations support. We pride ourselves in our ability to collaborate with the engineering functions of oil and gas operators, installation contractors and subsea equipment manufacturers to determine the fastest, safest, and most cost-effective solutions to the full spectrum of complex issues which arise in our industry.

&#160;

Project Management and Engineering . Our project management teams specialize in deepwater subsea developments. Our services are centered on the utilization of standardized hardware, proven, well-tested installation techniques, and experienced, consistent teams that have proven to be safe and skilled in all aspects of the installation process. Many installation contractors find it beneficial to utilize our services to help reduce on-board personnel since our specialized technicians can perform multiple tasks. Our teams have vast experience with the installation of flexible and rigid risers and flowlines, umbilicals, flexible and rigid jumpers, steel tube and thermoplastic hose flying leads, pipeline end terminations and manifolds. Our engineers have experience ranging from the initial conceptual design phases through manufacturing and installation, and concluding with topside connections and commissioning. Our experience provides us with a level of &#8220;hands on&#8221; and practical understanding that has proven to be indispensable in enabling us to offer custom solutions to the many problems encountered both subsea and topside. Because of our wide knowledge base, our engineering team is often hired by oil and gas operators, installation contractors and subsea equipment manufacturers to provide installation management and engineering support services. Our engineering team has been involved in several of the innovative solutions used today in deepwater subsea systems. We specialize in offshore installation engineering and the writing of practical installation procedures. We deal with issues involving flying leads, compliant umbilical splices, bend stiffener latchers, umbilical hardware, hold-back clamps, and the development of distribution system components. We are heavily involved in the fabrication of installation aids to simplify offshore executions, and offer hydraulic, fiber optic, and electrical testing services and various contingency testing tools.

&#160;

Spooling Services . Our experienced personnel are involved in the operation of spooling equipment on many projects, including operations for other companies to run their spooling equipment. We have developed a very efficient (in both time and cost) system for spooling, utilizing our horizontal drive units, under-rollers, tensioners, carousels and rapid deployment cartridges.

&#160;

Testing and Commissioning Services . Umbilical manufacturers, control suppliers, installation contractors, and oil and gas operators utilize our services to perform all aspects of testing, including initial Factory Acceptance Testing (&#8220;FAT&#8221;), extended factory acceptance testing and System Integration Testing (&#8220;SIT&#8221;), related to the connecting of the umbilical termination assemblies, the performing of installations, and the completion of the commissioning of the system thereafter. To execute these services, we have assembled a variety of personnel and equipment to ensure that all testing operations are done in a safe and time-efficient manner, ensuring a reduced overall project cost. We also work hard to utilize the most detailed digital testing and monitoring equipment to ensure that the most accurate data is provided to our customers. We have been hired to perform coiled tubing flushing, cleaning, and hydro testing, umbilical filling, flushing, pressure, flow rate, and cleanliness testing, load out monitoring and testing, installation monitoring, post installation testing, system commissioning, umbilical intermediate testing, and umbilical termination assembly cleanliness, flow, and leak testing. We employ a variety of different pumping systems to meet industry needs and offer maximum flexibility. Our philosophy is to flush through the maximum number of lines at the highest flow rate possible to maximize efficiency. Due to the different requirements for testing and commissioning of subsea systems, we have an assortment of pumps and equipment to deploy to ensure a safe and efficient commissioning program. We have experience handling all types of commissioning fluids, including asphaltine dispersants, diesel, methanol, xylene, corrosion inhibitors, water-based control fluids, oil-based control fluids, 100 percent glycol, paraffin inhibitors, and alcohol. We have been involved in the design, procurement, testing, installation, and operation of the testing equipment. Our engineers and service technicians can also assist in writing the testing procedures and sequences from simple FAT to very extensive multiple pressures and fluids testing up to full system SIT procedures. We work closely with the project managers and production platform engineers to help ensure that all aspects of the installation or retrieval project, including potential risks and dangers, are identified, planned for, and eliminated prior to arrival on the production platform.

&#160;

&#160;

Our shore-based facility located at Core Industries, Inc. in Mobile, AL has 6,500 square feet and houses our 3,400-ton carousel system, and is used to store customers&#8217; products. The site is sufficient to allow for full system integration testing of our customers&#8217; equipment prior to deployment offshore.

&#160;

ROV and ROV Tooling Services . As part of our ROV services, we have observation and light work class ROV units capable of operating in depths of 10,000 feet. Our services include offering these vehicles to strategic alliance partners who lease our vehicles and provide the actual services of platform inspection, platform installation and abandonment, search and recovery, salvage, subsea sampling, subsea intervention, telecommunication cable inspections, anchor handling, ROV consulting and project management, ROV pilots and technicians, and underwater cinematography. We provide an extensive line of ROV intervention tooling, both used to support our own operations and for rental to our customers. Our ROV Tooling equipment includes flying lead orientation tools, class 1-5 torque tools, hot stabs, pipe cutting systems, dredging and pumping systems, ROV clamps and ROV-friendly hooks and shackles that are state-of-the-art in design.

&#160;

Deep Down Marine Technologies. Deep Down Marine Technologies (&#8220;DDMT&#8221;) is a specialized division of Deep Down, Inc. primarily focused on the refurbishment and repurposing of recovered subsea distribution assets and providing support for offshore interventions.

&#160;

Items refurbished and repurposed for clients include Logic Caps (&#8220;LC(s)&#8221;), intermediate logic caps, and Hydraulic Distribution Manifolds (&#8220;HDM(s)&#8221;). Once a recovered asset is received, it is cleaned, any production fluids are flushed out with a water-based control fluid, and the asset is moved into storage. As an emergency or intervention arises, we pull the stored asset, reroute and weld the tubing, and then perform an FAT per client specifications. Finally, we send out our service technicians and equipment to support the offshore campaign.

&#160;

Additionally, we perform various tasks in support of offshore interventions. We reconfigure Deep Down Hydrate Remediation Frames and Hydraulic Flying Leads (&#8220;HFL(s)&#8221;) at either of our facilities or in the field. Our service technicians go offshore to pre-charge and make any changes to the frame needed to remediate hydrates.

&#160;

We also developed the Fast Response Box (&#8220;FRB&#8221;), a concept cultivated from our vast offshore campaign experience. Our team identified the necessary components for an emergency reroute of a chemical or hydraulic line performed on the deck of a vessel. After the subsea distribution hardware is brought up, our service technicians safely depressurize, flush, cut out tubing, and reroute as required to get the well or field back up and producing. We then pre-charge the system and assist in overboarding and reinstallation. Our ability to provide a fully functional temporary solution is designed to bring the well or field back into production immediately and allows time for a permanent solution to be developed.

&#160;

Our capabilities further include in-house software and hardware engineering to provide innovative solutions from wireless testing and monitoring equipment, to Dynamic Positioning (&#8220;DP&#8221;) systems. We have also developed camera systems that can be set up at any site, enabling our clients to witness FATs, SITs or vessel load-outs in real-time, from any location in the world.

&#160;

Products. We provide installation support equipment and component parts and assemblies for subsea distribution systems. We believe the key to successful installations of hardware is to design the subsea system by considering installation issues first, working backwards to the design of the hardware itself. This is why we have been instrumental in the development of hardware and techniques to simplify deepwater installations. We design, manufacture, fabricate, inspect, assemble and test subsea equipment, surface equipment and offshore equipment that is used by major integrated, large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies in offshore areas throughout the world. Our products are used during oil and gas exploration, development and production operations on offshore drilling rigs, such as floating rigs and jack-ups, and for drilling and production of oil and gas wells on offshore platforms, tension leg platforms and moored vessels such as floating production storage and offloading vessels (&#8220;FPSO&#8221;).

&#160;

Flying Leads . Deep Down is a leader in flying lead design, manufacture and installation; in particular steel tube flying leads. Our flagship product, the Loose Steel Tube Flying Lead (&#8220;LSFL&#174;&#8221;), was developed to eliminate the residual memory left in traditional flying leads due to the bundling process. The loose lay of the tubes significantly reduces stiffness of the assembly, allows the bundle to lay flat on the sea floor, follow the prescribed lay path precisely, bend in a tight radius with minimal resistance and offers maximum compliance for easy makeup in lengths up to 1,000&#8217;. When greater lengths up to 10,000&#8217; are required, we utilize our patented Non-Helical Umbilical (&#8220;NHU&#174;&#8221;) in conjunction with a complaint section on each end of the assembly to achieve the same result. We also offer hybrid LSFL&#174; assemblies which can include any number and combination of electrical, optical, hose and steel tube elements. Hybrid LSFL&#174; technology provides installation savings in both time and money as fewer operations are required to install the combined unit.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Deep Down employs the patented Moray&#174; termination system on each end of the LSFL&#174;. The Moray&#174; termination is a light weight, high-strength, configurable and field serviceable framework used to connect any commercially available Multi-Quick Connect (&#8220;MQC&#8221;) plate to the LSFL&#174; bundle. The Moray&#174; termination assembly allows the installation load from the steel tubes or strength member to be transmitted directly to the framework and through to the installation rigging while isolating couplers from the load to maintain maximum compliance. The Moray&#174; termination with compliant section is ideal for umbilical end terminations; it eliminates the need for bulky armor pots and is more manageable than a traditional umbilical end termination. In this application, the Moray&#174; termination can be used to house multiple electrical, optical and auxiliary hydraulic interfaces in integrated ROV panels. Moray&#174; termination assemblies can be outfitted with integrated buoyancy allowing quicker installation times by eliminating the need to recover buoyancy modules. Additionally, this allows for the use of a smaller class ROV on a vessel should the need for rework arise.

&#160;

Umbilical Hardware . Our blend of experiences with umbilical manufacturers, subsea engineers and installation contractors has been effective, giving us a unique perspective when fabricating and designing terminations for umbilical manufacturers. Members of our team were involved with the designs for the armored thermo plastic umbilicals at Oceaneering Multiflex, the first steel tube umbilical in the Gulf of Mexico for the Shell Popeye&#174; umbilical, and the standardization of many steel tube umbilical terminations. We believe our designs are often much lighter in weight and smaller than the typical hardware that has been created and used in the past by our competitors. Our engineering team has designed and fabricated bending restrictors, armor pots, split barrels, tubing fittings and unions, hinging umbilical splices and topside terminations with our unique threaded welded fittings, umbilical compliant splice, and the bend stiffener latcher. We offer both polymer and steel bend limiters. The compliant splice is a patented method of converting spare umbilicals into actual production umbilicals by splicing spare umbilicals together to produce any length required or to repair a damaged umbilical. This termination system eliminates the burdens of dealing with umbilical splices during installation and is capable of housing both electrical and fiber optic termination assemblies while still allowing for the splice to be spooled up onto a reel or carousel. Our Umbilical Termination Assembly (&#8220;UTA&#8221;) and new compliant UTA allows us to terminate the umbilical with a higher degree of quality and place the critical components of the base unit on the reel or on the carousel and handle it with additional ease and safety. Then it is combined with the mud mat assembly easily and offers both first end stab and hangover features as well as yoke second end landing. The new compliant version allows the UTA to be expanded for multiple J-plates and yet feature the same compliant features in our compliance splicing increasing the ease of handling on the deployment equipment &#8211; overboarding &#8211; and landing on the seafloor. Our termination services are becoming popular because they offer the ability to take existing umbilical hang offs from multiple manufacturers, which may have been exposed to terrible environmental conditions, and add them to temporary handling clamps &#8211; lifting up the umbilical and providing a completely new hangoff arrangement and thus extending the life of the umbilical and the subsea field. This service is being utilized on a project now. Bend Stiffener Latchers&#8482; (&#8220;BSL&#8482;&#8221;) are still the leaders in the industry allowing bend stiffeners to be carried by the umbilical topside termination assembly in a more compact and overlapping configuration. BSLs are overboarded with the highest strength and can be installed into an existing I-tube with existing flange or an I-tube with a mating bell mouth. They are then latched in by ROV allowing the bend stiffener to be securely attached to the I-tube transferring all the dynamic bending while the umbilical is pulled up and hung off. This process eliminates the handling of two major pieces of hardware, and the need to have measurements between the components as the system is fully extending and adjustable.

&#160;

Riser Isolation Valves and Subsea Isolation Valve Services. Deep Down's new Riser Isolation Valve (&#8220;RIV&#8221;) and Subsea Isolation Valve (&#8220;SSIV&#8221;) control systems are unique solutions providing platform personnel the hydraulic control and electrical indication for subsea production valve manipulation. These systems provide numerous advantages to the customer including: Emergency Shutdown (&#8220;ESD&#8221;) capabilities, valve positioning monitoring systems, and auxiliary positions for spare and/or future field development.

&#160;

In addition to fabrication of these systems, Deep Down provides subsea installation engineering, consulting, and service personnel to support clients, installation contractors, valve vendors and more. Our expertise ensures scope is fully defined and delegated allowing for safe and successful installations. The Deep Down team provides commissioning and technical assistance to clients and platform personnel, and seeks to ensure that the systems are working properly and all necessary operational information is handed over to the end users.

&#160;

Capitalizing on our expertise in umbilical manufacturing, Subsea and Topside Umbilical Termination Assemblies (&#8220;SUTA&#8221; / &#8220;TUTA&#8221;), hydraulic and electrical flying leads, and super duplex welding, we provide quality products our clients can depend on. Project designs are guaranteed to be installation friendly and help us meet client specifications. When Deep Down&#8217;s expert installation team is on the job, product integrity is preserved, helping us ensure successful installations.

&#160;

Installation Aids. &#160; To help our customers and to meet our own internal needs, we have developed an extensive array of installation aids, including steel flying lead installation systems, tensioners, lay chutes, many varieties of buoyancy, clump weights, Vortex Induced Vibration (&#8220; VIV&#8221;) strakes, mud mats, dual tank skids, gang boxes, work vans, pumping and testing skids, control booths, fluid drum carriers, crimping systems, load cells, 300 and 340-ton under-rollers, powered reels, 200-ton, 400-ton and 3,400-ton and 3,500 &#8211; ton carousel, UTA and bridging jumper running and parking deployment frames, termination shelters, pipe straighteners, ROV hooks and shackles, stackable SeaStax&#174; tanks, baskets, Subsea Deployment Basket System (SDB&#174;), Horizontal Drive Units (&#8220;HDU&#8221;) and Rapid Deployment Cartridges (&#8220;RDC&#8221;). 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Buoyancy Products. We design, engineer and manufacture deepwater buoyancy systems and support hardware essential to installation and operational requirements. Deep Down's rotational molding operations produce high density polyethylene products including bend restrictors, VIV suppression strakes and fairings, protective outer shells for distributed buoyancy modules and other flotation products. Our unique distributed buoyancy module clamps are designed for quick and easy installation for both &#34;over the stinger&#34; and vertical lay system methods.

&#160;

Further expansion of our flotation product line includes drilling riser buoyancy support hardware and installation services and development of a &#8220;Buoyant Rod&#8221; concept that we hope to have significant applications in the flotation industry.

&#160;

Non-Helical Umbilical&#174;. Deep Down's patented Non-Helical Umbilical&#174; (&#8220;NHU&#174;&#8221;) combines our experience manufacturing miles of loose steel tube flying leads, terminating conventional steel umbilicals, and observing installation behavior of all umbilicals. The NHU&#174; can be manufactured in lengths up to 10 miles using super duplex tubes in standard sizes and in any configuration of hydraulic, electrical or optical elements. It is intended for long-term infield (static) or short-term dynamic service applications.

&#160;

Multiple tubes may be fed into the patented Deep Down NHU&#174; manufacturing mechanism, bundled, then extruded with a HDPE outer jacket. Umbilicals are not torque balanced on their own, so rather than expending resources to balance and imparting stresses to helically wind them, the NHU&#174; uses the imbalance to its advantage, resulting in a standard bundle.

&#160;

The proprietary NHU&#174; manufacturing concept is fully containerized, portable and easily transported for setup virtually anywhere in the world. The ability to manufacture in close proximity to subsea fields offers the benefits of reduced lead times, the use of smaller installation vessels, use of compact Deep Down equipment, the incorporation of the appropriate percentages of local content, and more favorable economics.

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

For over a decade, our primary manufacturing facility was in Channelview, Texas, a suburb of Houston. In June of 2013, we reorganized our manufacturing efforts in order to maximize production and satisfy the increasing demand in the oil and gas industry. We are now operational at our new 215,000 sq. ft. facility on 20 acres off Beaumont Highway, conveniently located 10 minutes from our former Channelview facility.

&#160;

In addition to increasing our production capacity, this move also provided the space to build our Steel Tube Flying Lead (&#8220;STFL&#8221;) Overhead Tracking System. This system will allow us to easily move STFLs from station to station during production for welding, X-ray and FAT. We have also significantly expanded our clean, stainless steel welding and tube bending environment, which is separated from all carbon steel fabrication.

&#160;

We have a 12&#8217;x60&#8217; wet testing tank, adding the capability to test our products and rigging with buoyancy scenarios in the water. Featuring filtered water and underwater lighting, it will also enable us to launch and test small ROV&#8217;s and ROV operations.

&#160;

The most substantial benefit to the new facility is expected to be realized when the dock on the property is completed. This will allow us to move large equipment and fabricated items by barge, eliminating the costs and limitations of highway transportation.

&#160;

Our manufacturing plant is ISO 9001 certified. We continue to improve our standards and product quality through the use of quality assurance specialists working with our product manufacturing personnel throughout the manufacturing process. We have the capacity to complete large turn-key projects and still have reserve space for unforeseen emergency projects requiring immediate service and attention oil companies are accustomed to.

&#160;

Customers 

&#160; 

Demand for our deepwater and ultra-deepwater services, surface equipment and offshore rig equipment is dependent on the condition of the oil and gas industry and its ability and need to invest in capital expenditures as well as continual maintenance and improvements on its offshore exploration, drilling and production operations. The level of these expenditures is generally dependent upon various factors such as expected prices of oil and gas, exploration and production costs of oil and gas, and the level of offshore drilling and production activity. The prevailing view of future oil and gas prices are influenced by numerous factors affecting the supply and demand for oil and gas. These factors include worldwide economic activity, interest rates, cost of capital, environmental regulation, tax policies, and production levels and prices set and maintained by producing nations and OPEC. Capital expenditures are also dependent on the cost of exploring for and producing oil and gas, the sale and expiration dates of domestic and international offshore leases, the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves in offshore areas and technological advances. Oil and gas prices and the level of offshore drilling and production activity have historically been characterized by significant volatility.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our principal customers are major integrated oil and gas companies, large independent oil and gas companies, foreign national oil and gas companies, subsea equipment manufacturers and subsea equipment installation contractors involved in offshore exploration, development and production. Offshore drilling contractors, engineering and construction companies, and other companies involved in maritime operations represent a smaller customer base.

&#160;

We are not dependent on any one customer or group of customers. The number and variety of our products required in a given period by a customer depends upon its capital expenditure budget as well as the results of competitive bids. Consequently, a customer may account for a material portion of revenues in one period and may represent an immaterial portion of revenues in a subsequent period. While we are not dependent on any one customer or group of customers, the loss of one or more of our significant customers could, at least on a short-term basis, have an adverse effect on the results of our operations.

&#160;

Marketing and Sales 

&#160;

We market our services and products worldwide through our Houston-based sales force. We periodically advertise in trade and technical publications targeting our customer base. We also participate in industry conferences and trade shows to enhance industry awareness of our products and services. Our customers generally order products and services after consultation with us on their project. Orders are typically completed within two weeks to three months depending on the type of product or service. Larger and more complex products may require four to six months to complete, though we have accepted several longer-term projects, requiring significantly more time to complete. Our customers select our products and services based on the quality, reliability and reputation of the product or service, price, timely delivery and advanced technology. For large production system orders, we engage our project management team to coordinate customer needs with engineering, manufacturing and service organizations, as well as with subcontractors and vendors. Our profitability on projects is dependent on performing accurate and cost-effective bids as well as performing efficiently in accordance with bid specifications. Various factors can adversely affect our performance on individual projects that could potentially adversely affect the profitability of a project.

Backlog 

&#160; 

Information regarding our backlog is incorporated herein by reference from the section entitled, &#8220;Industry and Executive Outlook&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of this Report.

&#160;

Product Development and Engineering 

&#160; 

The technological demands of the oil and gas industry continue to increase as offshore exploration and drilling operations expand into deeper and more hostile environments. Conditions encountered in these environments include well pressures of up to 15,000 psi, mixed flows of oil and gas under high pressure that may also be highly corrosive, and water depths in excess of 5,000 feet. We are continually engaged in product development activities to generate new products and to improve existing products and services to meet our customers&#8217; specific needs. We also focus our activities on reducing the overall cost to the customer, which includes not only the initial capital cost but also operating costs associated with our products.

&#160;

We have an established track record of introducing new products and product enhancements. Our product development work is conducted at our facility in Houston, Texas, and in the field. Our application engineering staff also provides engineering services to customers in connection with the design and sales of our products. Our ability to develop new products and maintain technological advantages is important to our future success.

&#160;

We believe that the success of our business depends more on the technical competence, creativity and marketing abilities of our employees than on any individual patent, trademark or copyright. Nevertheless, as part of our ongoing product development and manufacturing activities, our policy is to seek patents when appropriate on inventions concerning new products and product improvements. All patent rights for products developed by employees are assigned to us.

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The principal competitive factors in the petroleum drilling, development and production and maritime equipment markets are quality, reliability and reputation of the product, price, technology, and timely delivery. We face significant competition from other manufacturers of exploration, production, and maritime equipment. Several of our primary competitors are diversified multinational companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources and have a longer history in the manufacturing of these types of equipment.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

At March 1, 2016, we had a total of 89 full-time employees. Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements and we generally consider our employee relations to be good. Our operations depend in part on our ability to attract a skilled labor force. While we believe that our wage rates are competitive and that our relationship with our skilled labor force is good, a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force and increases in the wage rates that we pay or both.

&#160;

Governmental Regulations 

&#160;

A significant portion of our business activities are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations and similar agencies of foreign governments. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly expensive, complex and stringent. These regulations are administered by various federal, state and local health and safety and environmental agencies and authorities, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. From time to time, we are also subject to a wide range of reporting requirements, certifications and compliance as prescribed by various federal and state governmental agencies. Expenditures relating to such regulations are made in the normal course of our business and are neither material nor place us at any competitive disadvantage. We do not currently expect that compliance with such laws will require us to make material additional expenditures.

&#160;

We are also affected by tax policies, price controls and other laws and regulations generally relating to the oil and gas industry, including those specifically directed to offshore operations. Adoption of laws and regulations that curtail exploration and development drilling for oil and gas could adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our services or products.

&#160;

Increased concerns about the environment have resulted in offshore drilling in certain areas being opposed by environmental groups, and certain areas have been restricted. To the extent that new or additional environmental protection laws that prohibit or restrict offshore drilling are enacted and result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general, our business could be materially affected. In addition, these laws may provide for &#34;strict liability&#34; for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety, rendering a party liable for the environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Certain environmental laws provide for joint and several liabilities for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. In addition, companies may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. Such laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may require us to obtain permits or other authorizations for certain activities and to comply with various standards or procedural requirements.

&#160;

We cannot determine to what extent our future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing regulations. We believe that our facilities are in substantial compliance with current regulatory standards. Based on our experience to date, we do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial position as a result of future compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation, more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require additional expenditures which may be material.
