 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

OUR BUSINESS 

WSFS Financial Corporation (the Company, our Company, we, our or us) is parent to Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB (WSFS Bank or the Bank), the seventh oldest bank and trust company in the United States continuously operating under the same name. At $5.6 billion in assets and $13.2 billion in fiduciary assets, WSFS Bank is also the largest bank and trust company headquartered in Delaware and the Delaware Valley. WSFS Bank has been in operation for 184 years. In addition to its focus on stellar customer service, the Bank has continued to fuel growth and remain a leader in our community. We are a relationship-focused, locally-managed, banking institution. For the tenth consecutive year, our Associates (what we call our employees) ranked us a &#147;Top Workplace&#148; in Delaware and for the fifth year in a row the readers of the Delaware News Journal voted us the &#147;Top Bank&#148; in the state. We state our mission simply: &#147;We Stand for Service.&#148; Our strategy of &#147;Engaged Associates delivering Stellar Service growing Customer Advocates and value for our Owners&#148; focuses on exceeding customer expectations, delivering stellar service and building customer advocacy through highly-trained, relationship-oriented, friendly, knowledgeable and empowered Associates. 

Our core banking business is commercial lending funded by customer-generated deposits. We have built a $3.1 billion commercial loan portfolio by recruiting the best seasoned commercial lenders in our markets and offering the high level of service and flexibility typically associated with a community bank. We fund this business primarily with deposits generated through commercial relationships and retail deposits. We service our customers primarily from our 63 offices located in Delaware (44), Pennsylvania (17), Virginia (1) and Nevada (1) and through our website at www.wsfsbank.com. We also offer a broad variety of consumer loan products, retail securities and insurance brokerage services through our retail branches and mortgage and title services through those branches and through Pennsylvania based WSFS Mortgage/Array Financial. WSFS Mortgage/Array Financial is a mortgage banking company and abstract and title company specializing in a variety of residential mortgage and refinancing solutions. 

Our Wealth Management segment provides a broad array of fiduciary, investment management, credit and deposit products to clients through four businesses. WSFS Wealth Investments provides insurance and brokerage products primarily to our retail banking clients. Cypress is a registered investment advisor with $637.8 million in assets under management. Cypress&#146; primary market segment is high net worth individuals and offers a &#145;balanced&#146; investment style focused on preservation of capital and providing for current income. Christiana Trust, with $12.58 billion in assets under management and administration, provides fiduciary and investment services to personal trust clients, and trustee, agency, bankruptcy administration, custodial and commercial domicile services to corporate and institutional clients. WSFS Private Banking serves high net worth clients by delivering credit and deposit products and partnering with other business units to deliver investment management and fiduciary products and services. 

Our Cash Connect segment is a leading provider of ATM Vault Cash and related services in the United States. Cash Connect manages $581 million in vault cash in over 16,000 non-bank ATMs nationwide. It also provides online reporting and ATM cash management, predictive cash ordering, armored carrier management, ATM processing, equipment sales and deposit safe cash logistics. Cash Connect also operates 467 ATMs for WSFS Bank. This is, by far, the largest branded ATM network in Delaware. Cash Connect is an innovator for our company and has various additional products and services in development. 

WSFS POINTS OF DIFFERENTIATION 

While all banks offer similar products and services, we believe that WSFS, through its service model, has set itself apart from other banks in our market and the industry in general. In addition, community banks such as WSFS have been able to distinguish themselves from large national or international banks that fail to provide their customers with the service levels, responsiveness and local decision making customers prefer. The following factors summarize what we believe are our points of differentiation: 

Building Associate Engagement and Customer Advocacy 

Our business model is built on a concept called Human Sigma, which we have implemented in our strategy of &#147;Engaged Associates delivering Stellar Service growing Customer Advocates and value for our Owners&#148;. The Human 

&#160; 

Sigma model, identified by Gallup, Inc., begins with Associates who have taken ownership of their jobs and therefore perform at a higher level. We invest significantly in recruitment, training, development and talent management because our Associates are the cornerstone of our business model. This strategy motivates Associates and unleashes innovation and productivity to engage our most valuable asset, our Customers, by providing them with Stellar Service experiences. As a result, we build Customer Advocates, or Customers who have developed an emotional attachment to the Bank. Research studies continue to show a direct link between Associate engagement, customer advocacy and a company&#146;s financial performance. Our success with this strategy creates a virtuous cycle, further building an environment of engagement and advocacy. 

&#160;

Surveys conducted for us by Gallup, Inc. indicate: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our Associate Engagement scores consistently rank in the top decile of companies polled. In 2015 our engagement ratio was 14:1, which means there were 14 engaged Associates for every disengaged Associate. This compares to a 2.6:1 ratio in 2003 and a national average of 1.53:1. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our customer advocacy scores rank in the top quartile of all companies. In 2015, 42% of our customers ranked us a &#147;five&#148; out of &#147;five,&#148; strongly agreeing with the statement &#147;I can&#146;t imagine a world without WSFS&#148; and 67% of our customers ranked us a &#147;five&#148; out of &#147;five,&#148; strongly agreeing with the statement &#147;WSFS is the perfect bank for me.&#148; 

By fostering a culture of engaged and empowered Associates, we believe we have become the employer and bank of choice in our market. In 2015, for the tenth year in a row, we were recognized by The Wilmington News Journal as a &#147;Top Work Place&#148; for large corporations in the State of Delaware. Also in 2015, and for the fifth consecutive year, a News Journal survey of its readers also ranked us the &#147;Top Bank&#148; in Delaware, indicating the strength of our focus on customer service. 

Community Banking Model 

Our size and community banking model play a key role in our success. Our approach to business combines a service-oriented culture with a strong complement of products and services, all aimed at meeting the needs of our retail and business Customers. We believe the essence of being a community bank means that we are: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Small enough to offer Customers responsive, personalized service and direct access to decision makers. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Large enough to provide all the products and services needed by our target market customers. 

&#160; 

As the financial services industry has consolidated, many independent banks have been acquired by national companies that have centralized their decision-making authority away from their customers and focused their mass-marketing on a regional or even national customer base. We believe this trend has frustrated smaller business owners who have become accustomed to dealing directly with their bank&#146;s senior executives and discouraged retail customers who often experience deteriorating levels of service in branches and other service outlets. Additionally, it frustrates bank employees who are no longer empowered to provide good and timely service to their customers. 

WSFS Bank offers: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; One primary point of contact. Each of our relationship managers is responsible for understanding his or her Customers&#146; needs and bringing together the right resources in the Bank to meet those needs. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A customized approach to our Customers. We believe this gives us an advantage over our competitors who are too large or centralized to offer customized products or services. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Products and services that our Customers value. This includes a broad array of banking, cash management and trust and trust and wealth management products, as well as a legal lending limit high enough to meet the credit needs of our Customers, especially as they grow. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Rapid response and a company that is easy to do business with. Our customers tell us this is an important differentiator from larger, in-market competitors. 

Strong Market Demographics 

Delaware is situated in the middle of the Washington, DC&#151;New York corridor which includes the urban markets of Philadelphia and Baltimore. The state benefits from this urban concentration as well as from a unique political, legal, tax and business environment. Delaware&#146;s rate of unemployment, median household income and rate of population growth all compare favorably to national averages.

(1) Bureau of Labor Statistics, Economy at a Glance (2) U.S. Census Bureau, State &#38; County Quick Facts Balance Sheet Management 

We put a great deal of focus on actively managing our balance sheet. This manifests itself in: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Prudent capital levels. Maintaining prudent capital levels is key to our operating philosophy. At December 31, 2015 our tangible capital ratio was 8.84% and all regulatory capital levels for WSFS Bank reflected a meaningful cushion above well-capitalized levels. At December 31, 2015, WSFS Bank&#146;s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.31% and $274.2 million in excess of the 6.5% &#147;well-capitalized&#148; level under the banking agencies&#146; prompt corrective action framework, Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.31% and $298 million in excess of the 8.0% &#147;well-capitalized&#148; level, and the Bank&#146;s total risk-based capital ratio was 13.11%, or $147 million above the &#147;well-capitalized&#148; level of 10.00%. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Disciplined Lending. We maintain discipline in our lending with a particular focus on portfolio diversification and granularity. Diversification includes limits on loans to one borrower as well as industry and product concentrations. We supplement this portfolio diversification with a disciplined underwriting process and the benefit of knowing our customers. We have also taken a proactive approach to identifying trends in our local economy and have responded to areas of concern. As a result we improved all criticized, classified and nonperforming loans to 17.7% of Tier 1 capital plus Allowance for Loan Losses (ALLL) at December 31, 2015 from 21.5% at December 31, 2014. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Focus on credit quality. We seek to control credit risk in our investment portfolio and use this portion of our balance sheet primarily to help us manage liquidity and interest rate risk, while providing marginal income and tax relief. Our philosophy and pre-purchase due diligence has allowed us to avoid the significant investment write-downs taken by many of our bank peers during the recent economic downturn (only $86,000 of other-than-temporary impairment charges recorded during this economic cycle). 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Asset Strategies. We have created an investment portfolio that is in line with the Board&#146;s approved risk appetite and we believe the portfolio contains minimal risks due to our exclusion of non-Agency (Private label) MBS and other asset-backed securities. We also believe that our thorough due diligence is effective in mitigating the credit risk associated with municipal securities that we have added. Further, our portfolio is highly liquid given our large amount of Agency MBS. 

Disciplined Capital Management 

We understand that our capital (or stockholders&#146; equity) belongs to our stockholders. They have entrusted this capital to us with the expectation that it will earn an appropriate return relative to the risk we take. Mindful of this balance, we prudently, but aggressively, manage our capital. 

Strong Performance Expectations and Alignment with Stockholder Priorities 

We are focused on high-performing, long-term financial goals. We define &#147;high-performing&#148; as the top quintile of a relevant peer group in return on assets (ROA), return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) and EPS growth. Management incentives are, in large part, based on driving performance in these areas. More details on management incentive plans will be included in the proxy statement for our 2016 annual meeting of stockholders. 

During 2015, our performance reflected continued progress on our path towards becoming a sustainably high performing company. In 2015, WSFS reported ROA of 1.05% and core and sustainable ROA, a non-GAAP calculation, stood at 1.24% in the final quarter of 2015. This exceeded our goal of at least a 1.20% core and sustainable ROA set in early 2013 as part of our 2013-2015 Strategic Plan. 

Growth 

We have achieved success over the long term in lending and deposit gathering, growing the Wealth Management segment&#146;s assets under administration and growing Cash Connect&#146;s customer base and customer cross-sell. Our success has been the result of a focused strategy that provides service, responsiveness and careful execution in a consolidating marketplace. We plan to continue to grow by: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Developing talented, service-minded Associates. We have successfully recruited Associates with strong ties to, and the passion to serve, their communities to enhance our service in existing markets and to provide a strong start in new communities. We also focus efforts on developing talent and leadership from our current Associate base to better equip those Associates for their jobs and prepare them for leadership roles at WSFS. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Embracing the Human Sigma concept. We are committed to building Associate Engagement and Customer Advocacy as a way to differentiate ourselves and grow our franchise. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Building fee income through investment in and growth of our Wealth Management and Cash Connect (ATM services) segments. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Continuing strong growth in commercial lending by: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Offering local decision-making by seasoned banking professionals. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Executing our community banking model that combines Stellar Service with the banking products and services our business customers&#146; demand. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Adding seasoned lending professionals that have helped us win customers in our Delaware and southeastern Pennsylvania markets. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Aggressively growing deposits. We have energized our retail branch strategy by combining Stellar Service with an expanded and updated branch network. We plan to continue to grow deposits by: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Offering products through an expanded and updated branch network. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Providing a Stellar Service experience to our Customers. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Further expanding our commercial Customer relationships with deposit and cash management products. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Finding creative ways to build deposit market share such as targeted marketing programs. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Selectively opening new branches, including in preferred southeastern Pennsylvania locations. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Seeking strategic acquisitions. In 2014 we acquired First Wyoming Financial Corporation and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, First National Bank of Wyoming (DE) (First Wyoming). On October 9, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Alliance Bancorp Inc. of Pennsylvania (Alliance) and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary Alliance Bank. Alliance was a locally-managed institution with eight branch locations headquartered in Broomall, PA. On November 23, 2015, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Penn Liberty Financial Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Penn Liberty which we expect to close in the third quarter of 2016. Penn Liberty Bank headquartered in Wayne, Pennsylvania was founded by experienced Pennsylvania bankers in 2004 to serve the local community by offering a wide array of financial products and services to small and mid-size businesses, professional real estate developers and investors, and retail customers throughout the western suburban Philadelphia marketplace. Penn Liberty reported $704 million in assets, $510 million in loans and $621 million in deposits as of December 31, 2015 and serves its customers from 11 offices in the demographically robust Chester and Montgomery Counties. Over the next several years we expect our growth will be approximately 80% organic and 20% through acquisitions, although each year&#146;s growth will reflect the opportunities available to us at the time. 

Innovation 

Our organization is committed to product and service innovation as a means to drive growth and to stay ahead of changing customer demands and emerging competition. Our organization has a focus on developing a strong &#147;culture of innovation&#148; that solicits, captures, prioritizes, and executes innovation initiatives, from product creation to process improvements. We intend to leverage technology and innovation to grow our business and to successfully execute on our strategy. 

Values 

Our values address integrity, service, accountability, transparency, honesty, growth and desire to improve. They are the core of our culture, they make us who we are and we live them every day. 

At WSFS we: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Do the right thing. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Serve others. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Are open and candid. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Grow and improve. 

Results 

Our focus on these points of differentiation has allowed us to grow our core franchise and build value for our stockholders. Since 2010, our commercial loans have grown from $2.0 billion to $3.1 billion, a strong 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Over the same period, customer funding has grown from $2.6 billion to $3.9 billion, an 8% CAGR. More importantly, over the last decade, stockholder value has increased at a far greater rate than our banking peers. An investment of $100 in WSFS stock in 2005 would be worth $175 at December 31, 2015. By comparison, $100 invested in the Nasdaq Bank Index in 2005 would be worth $117 at December 31, 2015. 

&#160;

CREDIT EXTENSION ACTIVITIES 

Over the past several years we have focused on growing the more profitable segments of our loan portfolio. Our current portfolio lending activity is concentrated on lending to small- to mid-sized businesses in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, primarily in Delaware, contiguous counties in Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey, as well as in northern Virginia. Since 2011, our total commercial loans have increased by $960.9 million, or 44% and accounted for approximately 85% of our loan portfolio in 2015, compared to 81% in 2011. Based on current market conditions, we expect our focus on growing C&#38;I loans and other relationship-based commercial loans to continue during the remainder of 2016 and beyond.

The second table details the total loan portfolio by those with fixed interest rates and those with adjustable interest rates. The tables show loans by remaining contractual maturity. Loans may be pre-paid, so the actual maturity may be earlier than the contractual maturity. Prepayments tend to be highly dependent upon the interest rate environment. Loans having no stated maturity or repayment schedule are reported in the Less than One Year category.

Pursuant to section 5(c) of the Home Owners&#146; Loan Act (HOLA), federal savings banks are generally permitted to invest up to 400% of their total regulatory capital in nonresidential real estate loans and up to 20% of their assets in commercial loans. As a federal savings bank that was formerly chartered as a Delaware savings bank, the Bank has certain additional lending authority. 

&#160; 

Commercial, owner occupied commercial, commercial mortgage and construction loans have higher levels of risk than residential mortgage lending. These loans typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment experience on loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project and may be more subject to adverse conditions in the commercial real estate market or in the general economy than residential mortgage loans. The majority of our commercial and commercial real estate loans are concentrated in Delaware, southeastern Pennsylvania (Chester and Delaware counties) and nearby areas. 

We offer commercial real estate mortgage loans on multi-family properties and on other commercial real estate. Generally, loan-to-value ratios for these loans do not exceed 80% of appraised value at origination. 

Our commercial mortgage portfolio was $966.7 million at December 31, 2015. Generally, this portfolio is diversified by property type, with no type representing more than 30% of the portfolio. The largest type is retail-related (shopping centers, malls and other retail) with balances of $272.2 million. The average loan size of a loan in the commercial mortgage portfolio is $597,248 and only nine loans are greater than $8.0 million, with no loans greater than $18.0 million. 

We offer commercial construction loans to developers. In some cases these loans are made as &#147;construction/permanent&#148; loans, which provides for disbursement of loan funds during construction with automatic conversion to mini-permanent loans (one &#151; five years) upon completion of construction. These construction loans are short-term, usually not exceeding two years, with interest rates indexed to our WSFS prime rate, the &#147;Wall Street&#148; prime rate or London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR), in most cases, and are adjusted periodically as these rates change. The loan appraisal process includes the same evaluation criteria as required for permanent mortgage loans, but also takes into consideration: completed plans, specifications, comparables and cost estimates. Prior to approval of each loan, these criteria are used as a basis to determine the appraised value of the subject property when completed. Our policy requires that all appraisals be reviewed independently from our commercial business development staff. At origination, the loan-to-value ratios for construction loans generally do not exceed 75%. The initial interest rate on the permanent portion of the financing is determined by the prevailing market rate at the time of conversion to the permanent loan. At December 31, 2015, $392.6 million was committed for construction loans, of which $243.5 million was outstanding. Residential construction and land development (CLD) represented $88.0 million, or 2%, of the loan portfolio and 14% of Tier 1 capital (Tier 1 + ALLL). Our commercial CLD portfolio was $66.6 million, or 2%, of total loans, and our &#147;land hold&#148; loans, which are land loans not currently being developed, were $41.4 million, or 1%, of total loans, at December 31, 2015. 

Commercial and industrial and owner occupied commercial loans make up the remainder of our commercial portfolio and include loans for working capital, financing equipment and real estate acquisitions, business expansion and other business purposes. These loans generally range in amounts of up to $30.0 million (with a few relationships exceeding this level) with an average loan balance in the portfolio of $293,322 and terms ranging from less than one year to ten years. The loans generally carry variable interest rates indexed to our WSFS prime rate, &#147;Wall Street&#148; prime rate or LIBOR. As of December 31, 2015, our commercial and industrial and owner occupied commercial loan portfolios were $1.9 billion and represented 51% of our total loan portfolio. These loans are diversified by industry, with no industry representing more than 13% of the portfolio. 

Federal law limits the Bank&#146;s extensions of credit to any one borrower to 15% of our unimpaired capital (approximately $87.1 million), and an additional 10% if the additional extensions of credit are secured by readily marketable collateral. Extensions of credit include outstanding loans as well as contractual commitments to advance funds, such as standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2015, no borrower had collective (relationship) total extensions of credit exceeding these legal lending limits. Only three commercial relationships, when all loans related to the relationship are combined, reach total extensions of credit in excess of $30.0 million. 

Residential Real Estate Lending 

Generally, we originate residential first mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 80% and require private mortgage insurance for up to 35% of the mortgage amount for mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80%. 

&#160; 

We do not have any significant concentrations of such insurance with any one insurer. On a very limited basis, we have originated or purchased loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80% without a private mortgage insurance requirement. At December 31, 2015, the balance of all such loans was approximately $1.9 million. 

Generally, our residential mortgage loans are underwritten and documented in accordance with standard underwriting criteria published by the FHLMC and other secondary market participants to assure maximum eligibility for subsequent sale in the secondary market. Typically, we sell only those loans originated specifically with the intention to sell on a &#147;flow&#148; basis. 

To protect the propriety of our liens, we require title insurance be obtained. We also require fire, extended coverage casualty and flood insurance (where applicable) for properties securing residential loans. All properties securing our residential loans are appraised by independent, licensed and certified appraisers and are subject to review in accordance with our standards. 

The majority of our adjustable-rate, residential real estate loans have interest rates that adjust yearly after an initial period. The change in rate for the first adjustment date could be higher than the typical limited rate change of two percentage points at each subsequent adjustment date. Adjustments are generally based upon a margin (currently 2.75% for U.S. Treasury index; 2.5% for LIBOR index) over the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity, as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve). 

Usually, the maximum rate on these loans is six percent above the initial interest rate. We underwrite adjustable-rate loans under standards consistent with private mortgage insurance and secondary market underwriting criteria. We do not originate adjustable-rate mortgages with payment limitations that could produce negative amortization. 

The adjustable-rate mortgage loans in our loan portfolio help mitigate the risk related to our exposure to changes in interest rates. However, there are unquantifiable credit risks resulting from potential increased costs to the borrower as a result of re-pricing adjustable-rate mortgage loans. During periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on adjustable-rate mortgage loans may increase due to the upward adjustment of interest costs to the borrower. Further, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans allow us to increase the sensitivity of our asset base to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that yields on our adjustable-rate mortgages will adjust sufficiently to compensate for increases to our cost of funds during periods of extreme interest rate increases. 

The original contractual loan payment period for residential loans is normally 10 to 30 years. Because borrowers may refinance or prepay their loans without penalty, these loans tend to remain outstanding for a substantially shorter period of time. First mortgage loans customarily include &#147;due-on-sale&#148; clauses. This provision gives us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property subject to the mortgage. We enforce due-on-sale clauses through foreclosure and other legal proceedings to the extent available under applicable laws. 

In general, loans are sold without recourse except for the repurchase right arising from standard contract provisions covering violation of representations and warranties or, under certain investor contracts, a default by the borrower on the first payment. We also have limited recourse exposure under certain investor contracts in the event a borrower prepays a loan in total within a specified period after sale, typically 120 days. The recourse is limited to a pro rata portion of the premium paid by the investor for that loan, less any prepayment penalty collectible from the borrower. There was one repurchase in 2015 totaling $385,000, two repurchases totaling $354,000 in 2014 and no repurchases in 2013. 

Consumer Lending 

Our primary consumer credit products (excluding first mortgage loans) are home equity lines of credit and equity-secured installment loans. At December 31, 2015, home equity lines of credit outstanding totaled $228.5 million and equity-secured installment loans totaled $89.7 million. In total, these product lines represented 88.3% of total consumer 

&#160; 

loans. Some home equity products grant a borrower credit availability of up to 100% of the appraised value (net of any senior mortgages) of their residence. However, typically maximum loan to value (LTV) limits are 89% for primary residences and 75% for all other properties. At December 31, 2015, we had $329.1 million in total commitments for home equity lines of credit. Home equity lines of credit offer customers potential Federal income tax advantages, the convenience of checkbook and debit card access, revolving credit features for a portion of the life of the loan and typically are more attractive in a low interest rate environment. Home equity lines of credit expose us to the risk that falling collateral values may leave us inadequately secured. The risk on installment products like home equity loans is mitigated as they amortize over time. 

The following table shows our consumer loans at year-end, for the last five years.

&#160; Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales 

We engage in traditional lending activities primarily in Delaware, southeastern Pennsylvania, and contiguous areas of neighboring states. As a federal savings bank, however, we may originate, purchase and sell loans throughout the United States. We have purchased limited amounts of loans from outside our normal lending area when such purchases are deemed appropriate. We originate fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential real estate loans through our banking offices. 

During 2015 we originated $434.6 million of residential real estate loans. This compares to originations of $316.1 million in 2014. From time to time, we have purchased whole loans and loan participations in accordance with our ongoing asset and liability management objectives. There were no such purchases in either 2015 or 2014. Residential real estate loan sales totaled $286.2 million in 2015 and $201.8 million in 2014. We sell certain newly originated mortgage loans in the secondary market as a means of generating fee income to control the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet and to manage overall balance sheet mix. We hold certain fixed-rate mortgage loans for investment, consistent with our current asset/liability management strategies. 

At December 31, 2015, we serviced approximately $106.5 million of residential mortgage loans for others, compared to $125.2 million at December 31, 2014. We also serviced residential mortgage loans for our own portfolio totaling $306.3 million and $218.3 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Our consumer lending activity is conducted mainly through our branch offices and referrals from other parts of our business. We originate a variety of consumer credit products including home improvement loans, home equity lines of credit, automobile loans, unsecured lines of credit and other secured and unsecured personal installment loans. 

We offer government-insured reverse mortgages to our customers. Our activity has been limited to acting as a correspondent originator for these loans. During 2015 we originated and sold $2.8 million in reverse mortgages compared to $1.8 million during 2014. 

We originate commercial real estate and commercial loans through our commercial lending division. Commercial loans are made for working capital, financing equipment acquisitions, business expansion and other business purposes. During 2015 we originated $1.1 billion of commercial and commercial real estate loans compared to $925.6 million in 2014. To reduce our exposure on certain types of these loans, and/or to maintain relationships within internal lending 

&#160; 

limits, at times we will sell a portion of our commercial loan portfolio, typically through loan participations. Commercial loan sales totaled $22.6 million and $39.9 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. These amounts represent gross contract amounts and do not necessarily reflect amounts outstanding on those loans. We also periodically buy participations from other banks. Commercial loan participation purchases totaled $66.1 million and $35.2 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Any significant modification or additional exposure to one borrowing relationship exceeding $3.5 million must be approved by the Senior Management Loan Committee (SLC). The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the minutes of the SLC meetings. The Executive Committee also approves new credit exposures exceeding $10 million and new credit exposures in excess of $5 million for customers with higher risk profiles, larger existing relationship exposures, or multiple policy exceptions. Depending upon their experience and management position, individual officers of the Bank have the authority to approve smaller loan amounts. Our credit policy includes a $30 million &#147;House Limit&#148; to any one borrowing relationship. In rare circumstances, we will approve exceptions to the &#147;House Limit&#148;. Our policy allows for only 15 such relationships with an aggregate exposure of 10% of Tier I Capital plus ALLL. Currently, we have three relationships exceeding this limit. At December 31, 2015, the aggregate exposure over &#147;House Limit&#148; totaled 3.2% of Tier I Capital plus ALLL. Those three relationships were approved to exceed the &#147;House Limit&#148; because the credit profile was deemed strong, or because of a long relationship history with the borrower(s). 

Fee Income from Lending Activities 

We earn fee income from lending activities, including fees for originating loans, servicing loans and selling loans and loan participations. We also receive fee income for making commitments to originate construction, residential and commercial real estate loans. Additionally, we collect fees related to existing loans which include prepayment charges, late charges, assumption fees and swap fees. In addition, as part of the loan application process, the borrower may pay us for out-of-pocket costs to review the application, whether or not the loan is closed. 

Most loan fees are not recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations immediately, but are deferred as adjustments to yield in accordance with GAAP, and are reflected in interest income over the expected life of the loan. Those fees represented interest income of $4.7 million, $3.1 million, and $2.5 million during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Loan fee income was mainly due to fee accretion on new and existing loans (including the acceleration of the accretion on loans that paid early), loan growth and prepayment penalties. The overall increase in loan fee income was the result of the growth in certain loan categories and higher prepayments during 2015. 

LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE, PROBLEM ASSETS AND DELINQUENCIES 

Our results of operations can be negatively impacted by nonperforming assets, which include nonaccruing loans, nonperforming real estate investments, assets acquired through foreclosure and restructured loans. Nonaccruing loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if, in our opinion, collection is doubtful, or when principal or interest is past due 90 days and collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest payments. Interest accrued, but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, is reversed and charged against interest income. In addition, the accretion of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on our assessment of the ultimate collectability of principal and interest. 

We endeavor to manage our portfolio to identify problem loans as promptly as possible and take immediate actions to minimize losses. To accomplish this, our Loan Administration and Risk Management Department monitors the asset quality of our loans and investments in real estate portfolios and reports such information to the Credit Policy, Audit and Executive Committees of the Board of Directors and the Bank&#146;s Controller&#146;s Department. 

SOURCES OF FUNDS 

We manage our liquidity risk and funding needs through our Treasury function and our Asset/Liability Committee. Historically, we have had success in growing our loan portfolio. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2015, net loan growth resulted in the use of $285.7 million in cash, as compared to $86.6 during 2014. The loan growth in 2015 

&#160; 

was spread across all loan categories and was driven by the Alliance acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2015 and our continued strong organic growth in lending. We expect this trend to continue during 2016. As a result of increased deposit growth, our loan-to-total customer funding ratio at December 31, 2015 was 97%, better than our 2015 strategic goal of 101%. We have significant experience managing our funding needs through both borrowings and deposit growth. 

As a financial institution, we and the Bank have access to several sources of funding. Among these are: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Net income 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Retail deposit programs 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Loan repayments 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; FHLB borrowings 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Repurchase agreements 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Federal Discount Window access 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Brokered deposits 

Our branch expansion and renovation program has been focused on expanding our retail footprint in Delaware and southeastern Pennsylvania and attracting new customers in part to provide additional deposit growth. However, in recent years we have purposefully reduced reliance on higher-cost, typically single-service certificate of deposit (CD) accounts. Core customer deposit growth (deposits excluding CDs) was strong, equaling $311.5 million during 2015, an 11% increase over 2014. 

Deposits 

WSFS Bank is the largest independent full-service bank and trust institution headquartered and operating in Delaware. The Bank primarily attracts deposits through its retail branch offices and loan production offices, in Delaware&#146;s New Castle, Sussex and Kent Counties, as well as nearby southeastern Pennsylvania. 

The Bank offers various deposit products to our customers, including savings accounts, demand deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit. In addition, the Bank accepts &#147;jumbo&#148; certificates of deposit with balances in excess of $100,000 from individuals, businesses and municipalities in Delaware. 

The following table shows the maturities of certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2015:

&#160; Federal Home Loan Bank Advances 

As a member of the FHLB, we are able to obtain FHLB advances. At December 31, 2015, we had $669.5 million in FHLB advances with a weighted average rate of 0.50%. Outstanding advances from the FHLB had rates ranging from 0.42% to 1.23% at December 31, 2015. Pursuant to collateral agreements with the FHLB, the advances are secured by qualifying first mortgage loans, qualifying fixed-income securities, FHLB stock and an interest-bearing demand deposit account with the FHLB. We are required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB in an amount at least equal to 4.00% of our borrowings from it, plus 0.10% of our member asset value. As of December 31, 2015, our FHLB stock investment totaled $30.5 million. 

&#160; 

We received $2.2 million in dividends from the FHLB during 2015. For additional information regarding FHLB stock, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Trust Preferred Borrowings 

In 2005, the Trust issued $67.0 million aggregate principal amount of Pooled Floating Rate Securities at a variable interest rate of 177 basis points over the three-month LIBOR rate. These securities are callable and have a maturity date of June 1, 2035. 

Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase 

During 2015 and 2014, we purchased federal funds as a short-term funding source. At December 31, 2015, we had purchased $128.2 million in federal funds at an average rate of 0.45%, compared to $103.2 million in federal funds at a rate of 0.29% at December 31, 2014. 

As of December 31, 2015, we no longer had securities under agreements to repurchase as a funding source. At December 31, 2014, we had $25.0 million of securities sold under agreements to repurchase with a fixed rate of 2.98% and a scheduled maturity of January 1, 2015. The underlying securities were MBS with a book value of $35.9 million as of December 31, 2014. 

Senior Debt 

In 2012 we issued and sold $55.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Senior Notes due 2019 (Senior Debt). The Senior Debt is unsecured and ranks equally with all of our other present and future unsecured, unsubordinated obligations. The Senior Debt is effectively subordinated to our secured indebtedness and structurally subordinated to the indebtedness of our subsidiaries. Interest payments on the Senior Debt are due quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year. At our option, the Senior Debt is callable, in whole or in part, after five years at a price equal to the outstanding principal amount to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Senior Debt matures on September 1, 2019. 

PERSONNEL 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 947 full-time equivalent Associates (employees). Our Associates are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe our relationship with our Associates is very good, as evidenced by our being named a &#147;Top Workplace&#148; by an independent survey of our Associates for the last ten years. 

REGULATION 

Overview 

The Company and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state banking laws, regulations, and policies that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors. The Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the banking system as a whole, are not for the protection of our other creditors and stockholders. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is the Bank&#146;s primary regulator and the Federal Reserve is the Company&#146;s primary regulator. 

The statutes enforced by, and regulations and policies of, these agencies affect most aspects of our business, including prescribing permissible types of activities and investments, the amount of required capital and reserves, requirements for branch offices, the permissible scope of our activities and various other requirements. 

The Bank&#146;s deposits are insured by the FDIC to the fullest extent allowed by law. As an insurer of bank deposits, the FDIC promulgates regulations, conducts examinations, requires the filing of reports and generally supervises the operations of all institutions to which it provides deposit insurance. 

&#160; 

Financial Reform Legislation 

Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently introduced in Congress, in the state legislatures and by various bank regulatory agencies. 

In 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. This Act imposed new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions and their holding companies, including depository institutions. The new law also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent agency within the Federal Reserve. The following discussion summarizes significant aspects of the new law that may affect us. Certain significant regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act have not been finalized and therefore we cannot yet determine the full impact on our business and operations. 

The following aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act, among others, are related to the operations of our Bank: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Office of Thrift Supervision, formerly the primary regulator of federal savings associations and savings and loan holding companies, was merged into the OCC and the Federal Reserve and the federal savings association charter has been preserved under OCC jurisdiction. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been established within the Federal Reserve, empowered to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. Depository institutions of less than $10 billion in total assets, like our Bank, are subject to the supervision and enforcement of their primary federal banking regulator with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits has been repealed. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Federal preemption of state laws applied to federal savings associations has been amended. Now, state law is preempted with respect to federal savings associations to the same extent such laws would be preempted with respect to a national bank. A state consumer financial law is preempted whenever it has a discriminatory intent or effect on a federal savings association compared to state-chartered institutions; prevents or significantly interferes with a federal savings association&#146;s federal powers; or it is preempted by a federal law other than the National Bank Act. The OCC must make a preemption determination on a case-by-case basis with respect to a particular state consumer financial law or other state law with substantively equivalent terms. In addition, state consumer financial laws are no longer preempted with respect to the activities of a federal savings association&#146;s subsidiaries. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Deposit insurance coverage has been permanently increased to $250,000 per depositor per insured depository institution. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The deposit insurance assessment base has been changed to equal a depository institution&#146;s total consolidated assets minus the sum of its average tangible equity during the assessment period. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund increased to 1.35% of estimated annual insured deposits or assessment base. However, the FDIC was directed to offset the effect of the increased reserve ratio for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. 

The following aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act, among others, are related to the operations of the Company: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Supervisory authority over savings and loan holding companies has been transferred to the Federal Reserve. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Leverage capital requirements and risk-based capital requirements applicable to depository institutions and bank holding companies have been extended to savings and loan holding companies following a five year grace period. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) was amended to direct federal regulators to require depository institution holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository institution subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Federal Reserve can require a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company that conducts commercial or manufacturing activities or other nonfinancial activities in addition to financial activities to conduct all or part of its financial activities in an intermediate savings and loan holding company. The Federal Reserve is required to promulgate rules setting forth the criteria for when a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company would be required to establish an intermediate holding company, but to date it has not yet proposed any such rules. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Public companies are required to provide their shareholders with a nonbinding vote (i) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executives, and (ii) at least once every six years on whether they should have such &#147;say on pay&#148; vote every one, two or three years. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Additional provisions, including some not specifically aimed at savings associations and savings and loan holding companies, nonetheless may have an impact on us. 

Some of these provisions have the consequence of increasing our expenses, decreasing our revenues, and changing the activities in which we choose to engage. We expect that the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to increase our operating and compliance costs. Specific impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act on our current activities or new financial activities will become evident in the future, and our financial performance and the markets in which we operate will continue to depend on the manner in which the relevant agencies develop and implement the required rules and the reaction of market participants to these regulatory developments. Some aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act continue to be subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us, our customers, or the financial industry in general. 

RECENT LEGISLATION 

Basel III 

In 2013, the Federal banking agencies approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations. Under the final rules as of January 2015, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital maintained by the Company and the Bank. The rules included a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5%, raised the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0%, required a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, and required a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. The final rule also established a new capital conservation buffer, comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital, above the regulatory minimum capital requirements. This capital conservation buffer will be phased-in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increase each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching its final level of 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The final rules also revised the standards for an insured depository institution to be &#147;well-capitalized&#148; under the banking agencies&#146; prompt corrective action framework, requiring a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0% and total capital ratio of 10.0%, while leaving unchanged the existing 5.0% leverage ratio requirement. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented under the final rules. Newly issued trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock may no longer be included in Tier 1 capital. However, for depository institution holding companies of less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Company, most outstanding trust preferred securities and other non-qualifying securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 are permanently grandfathered to be included in Tier 1 capital (up to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital, excluding non-qualifying capital instruments). 

The phase-in period for the final rules began for us on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule&#146;s requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule and should be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2015, WSFS Bank was &#147;well-capitalized&#148; under the capital rules. 

In October 2014, the BCBS published Basel III: The Net Stable Funding Ratio . The NSFR is a significant component of Basel III as it requires banking organizations to maintain a stable funding position in relation to their on- and off-balance sheet activities over a one year horizon. It is being implemented to reduce the likelihood that disruptions to a banking organization&#146;s normal source of funding will not significantly erode its liquidity position. This requirement will become effective January 1, 2018. The BCBS&#146; NSFR applies to internationally active banking organizations, but may also be applied to other banking organizations. The U.S. banking regulators have not yet proposed a rule implementing the 

&#160; 

NSFR, and as such, it is not known whether the NSFR will apply to banking organizations of our size and profile in the U.S. We are mindful of this and other potential risk management and reporting requirements. Management will continue to monitor any additional developments and their potential impact to our liquidity requirements. 

Debit Card Interchange Fees 

The Federal Reserve has issued rules under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, to limit interchange fees that an issuer may receive or charge for an electronic debit card transaction. Under the rules, the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and five basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. In addition, the rules allow for an upward adjustment of no more than one cent to an issuer&#146;s debit card interchange fee if the issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the fraud-prevention standards set out in the rule. 

In accordance with the statute, issuers that, together with their affiliates, have assets of less than $10.0 billion on the annual measurement date (December 31), such as the Bank, are exempt from the debit card interchange fee standards. 

Regulation of the Company 

General 

The Company is a registered savings and loan holding company and is subject to the regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve. 

The Company is also a public company subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC. Certain reports that we file with or furnish to the SEC, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, are available free of charge on the investor relations page of our website at www.wsfsbank.com by following the link, &#147;About WSFS&#148; followed by &#147;Investor Relations&#148;. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

In July 2002, Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and regulations adopted by the SEC, require us to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K a report stating management&#146;s responsibility to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting and management&#146;s conclusion on the effectiveness of the internal controls at year end. Additionally, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to and report on management&#146;s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting. 

Restrictions on Acquisitions 

Federal law generally prohibits a savings and loan holding company, without prior regulatory approval, from acquiring direct or indirect control of all, or substantially all, of the assets of any other savings association or savings and loan holding company, or more than 5% of the voting shares of a savings association or savings and loan holding company. These provisions also prohibit, among other things, any director or officer of a savings and loan holding company, or any individual who owns or controls more than 25% of the voting shares of such holding company, from acquiring control of any savings association that is not a subsidiary of such savings and loan holding company, unless the acquisition is approved by the Federal Reserve. 

The Company is a grandfathered unitary thrift holding company. Should we lose that status, we will be constrained in our ability to acquire companies or business lines that engage in non-banking activities, and may be required to divest any companies that we already own that engage in non-banking activities. 

&#160; 

Safe and Sound Banking Practices 

Savings and loan holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in activities that represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or constitute violations of laws or regulations. For example, for bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve&#146;s Regulation Y requires a holding company to give the Federal Reserve Board prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the company&#146;s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may oppose the transaction if it believes the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. As another example, a holding company could not impair its subsidiary bank&#146;s soundness by causing it to make funds available to non-banking subsidiaries or their customers if the Federal Reserve believed it not prudent to do so. The Federal Reserve may apply same or similar standards to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve can assess civil money penalties on a party for activities conducted on a knowing or reckless basis, if those activities caused more than a minimal loss to an institution or pecuniary gain to the party. The penalties can be as high as $425,000 for each day the activity continues. 

Source of Strength 

In accordance with FDIA, the Company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank. Under this policy, the holding company is expected to commit resources to support its bank subsidiary, including at times when the holding company may not be in a financial position to provide it. 

The Dodd-Frank Act added additional guidance regarding the source of strength doctrine and has directed the regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations to revise the capital requirements for holding companies to a level that is not less than those applicable to insured depository institutions. 

Dividends 

The principal source of the Company&#146;s cash is from dividends from the Bank. Our earnings and activities are affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. For example, these include limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the holding company and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization&#146;s expected future capital needs and current and prospective financial condition. The policy provides that holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the holding company&#146;s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiary. Consistent with this policy, a banking organization should have comprehensive policies on dividend payments that clearly articulate the organization&#146;s objectives and approaches for maintaining a strong capital position and achieving the objectives of the Federal Reserve&#146;s policy statement. 

In 2009, the Federal Reserve issued a supervisory letter providing greater clarity to its policy statement on the payment of dividends by holding companies. In this letter, the Federal Reserve stated that when a holding company&#146;s board of directors is considering the payment of dividends, it should consider, among other things, the following factors: (i) overall asset quality, potential need to increase reserves and write down assets, and concentrations of credit; (ii) potential for unanticipated losses and declines in asset values; (iii) implicit and explicit liquidity and credit commitments, including off-balance sheet and contingent liabilities; (iv) quality and level of current and prospective earnings, including earnings capacity under a number of plausible economic scenarios; (v) current and prospective cash flow and liquidity; (vi) ability to serve as an ongoing source of financial and managerial strength to depository institution subsidiaries insured by the FDIC, including the extent of double leverage and the condition of subsidiary depository institutions; (vii) other risks that affect the holding company&#146;s financial condition and are not fully captured in regulatory capital calculations; (viii) level, composition, and quality of capital; and (ix) ability to raise additional equity capital in prevailing market and economic conditions (the Dividend Factors). It is particularly important for a holding company&#146;s board of directors to ensure that the dividend level is prudent relative to the organization&#146;s financial position and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios. In addition, a holding company&#146;s board of directors should strongly consider, after careful analysis of the Dividend Factors, reducing, deferring, or eliminating dividends when the quantity 

&#160; 

and quality of the holding company&#146;s earnings have declined or the holding company is experiencing other financial problems, or when the macroeconomic outlook for the holding company&#146;s primary profit centers has deteriorated. The Federal Reserve further stated that, as a general matter, a holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce its distributions if: (i) its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (ii) its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or (iii) it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Failure to do so could result in a supervisory finding that the holding company is operating in an unsafe and unsound manner. 

Additionally, as discussed above, the Federal Reserve possesses enforcement powers over savings and loan holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices, or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by bank and savings and loan holding companies. 

Cypress

The Investment Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Investment Advisers Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser&#146;s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Noncompliance with the Investment Advisers Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage. 

Regulation of WSFS Bank 

General 

As a federally chartered savings institution the Bank is subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC. The lending activities and other investments of the Bank must comply with various federal regulatory requirements. The OCC periodically examines the Bank for compliance with regulatory requirements. The FDIC also has the authority to conduct special examinations of the Bank. The Bank must file reports with the OCC describing its activities and financial condition. The Bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements promulgated by the Federal Reserve. 

Transactions with Affiliates; Tying Arrangements 

The Bank is subject to certain restrictions in its dealings with us and our affiliates. Transactions between savings associations and any affiliate are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, with additional limitations found in Section 11 of the Home Owners&#146; Loan Act. An affiliate of a savings association, generally, is any company or entity which controls or is under common control with the savings association or any subsidiary of the savings association that is commonly controlled by an affiliate or a bank or savings association. In a holding company context, the parent holding company of a savings association (such as the Company) and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the savings association. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B (i) limit the extent to which the savings institution or its subsidiaries may engage in &#147;covered transactions&#148; with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such institution&#146;s capital stock and surplus, and limit the aggregate of all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus and (ii) require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate. The term &#147;covered transaction&#148; includes the making of loans to the affiliate, purchase of assets from the affiliate, issuance of a guarantee on behalf of the affiliate and several other types of transactions. In addition to the restrictions imposed by Sections 23A and 23B, the Home Owners&#146; Loan Act also prohibits a savings association from (i) lending or otherwise extending credit to an affiliate that engages in any activity impermissible for bank holding companies, or (ii) purchasing or investing in any stocks, bonds, debentures, notes or similar obligations of any affiliate, except for the purchase of shares of a subsidiary. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

Under revised capital regulations effective January 1, 2015 for the Bank, savings institutions must maintain &#147;tangible&#148; capital equal to 1.5% of average total assets, common equity Tier 1 equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital equal to 6% of risk-weighted assets, total capital (a combination of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) equal to 8% of risk-weighted assets, and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets equal to 4%. The OCC&#146;s revised prompt corrective action regulations require that in order to be &#147;well capitalized&#148;, a savings association must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%, total capital ratio of 10.0%, and 5.0% leverage ratio, and not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the OCC. In addition, the prompt corrective action regulations impose certain restrictions on savings associations that have a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of less than 6.0% or a ratio of common Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of less than 5.0%. 

The revised capital rules define common equity Tier 1 capital as predominantly comprised of common stock instruments (including retained earnings), related surplus, certain minority interests in the equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries (subject to certain limitations), less certain intangible assets and, subject to certain limitations, mortgage and non-mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets. Additional Tier 1 capital includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, and certain minority interests in the equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries not included in common equity Tier 1 capital (subject to certain limitations). Tier 2 capital includes subordinated debt with a minimum original maturity of five years, related surplus, certain minority interests in in the equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries not included in Tier 1 capital (subject to certain limitations), and limited amounts of a bank&#146;s allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL). Tangible capital is given the same definition as Tier 1 capital. The capital rules require that common equity Tier 1 capital be reduced by an amount equal to a savings institution&#146;s debt and equity investments in &#147;non-includable&#148; subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible to national banks, other than subsidiaries engaged in activities undertaken as agent for customers or in mortgage banking activities and subsidiary depository institutions or their holding companies. 

The risk weights assigned by the risk-based capital regulation range from 0% for cash, U.S. government securities, and certain other assets, 50% for qualifying residential mortgage exposures, 100% for corporate exposures and non-qualifying mortgage loans and certain other assets, to over 100% for certain past-due exposures and equity exposures. 

At December 31, 2015, the Bank was in compliance with the minimum common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, total capital, tangible capital and leverage capital requirements. 

The Company is subject to similar minimum capital requirements as the Bank, except that the Company is not subject to a tangible capital ratio. As of December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with the minimum common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, total capital, and leverage capital requirements. For the Company to be &#147;well capitalized,&#148; the Bank must be well-capitalized and the Company must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of December 31, 2015, the Company met all the requirements to be deemed well-capitalized. 

Dividend Restrictions 

OCC regulations govern capital distributions by savings institutions, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the capital account of a savings institution to make capital distributions. A savings institution must file an application for OCC approval of the capital distribution if either (1) the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year (including the proposed capital distribution) exceed the sum of the institution&#146;s net income for that year to date plus the institution&#146;s retained net income for the preceding two years, (2) the institution would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution, (3) the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or OCC-imposed condition, or (4) the institution is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings. If an application is not required to be filed, savings institutions that are a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as the Bank (as well as certain other institutions) must still file a notice with the OCC at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution. 

&#160; 

An institution that either before or after a proposed capital distribution fails to meet its then-applicable minimum capital requirement may not make any capital distributions without the prior written approval of the OCC. In addition, the OCC may prohibit a proposed capital distribution, which would otherwise be permitted by OCC regulations, if the OCC determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. 

Under federal law, an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution if the capital distribution would cause the institution to become undercapitalized or if it is already undercapitalized. In addition, federal regulators have the authority to restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends for safety and soundness reasons. The FDIC also prohibits an insured depository institution from paying dividends on its capital stock or interest on its capital notes or debentures (if such interest is required to be paid only out of net profits) or distributing any of its capital assets while it remains in default in the payment of any assessment due the FDIC. The Bank is currently not in default in any assessment payment to the FDIC. 

Insurance of Deposit Accounts 

The Bank&#146;s deposits are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the Deposit Insurance Fund. As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, insured institutions. It also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the FDIC. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings institutions, after giving the OCC an opportunity to take such action. 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIA was amended to increase the maximum deposit insurance amount per depositor per depository institution from $100,000 to $250,000. 

The FDIC has adopted a risk-based premium system that provides for quarterly assessments. In addition, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a mixed-ownership government corporation established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Deposit Insurance Fund. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2019. 

In 2011, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement changes to its assessment base used to determine risk-based premiums for insured depository institutions as required under the Dodd-Frank Act and also changed the risk-based pricing system necessitated by changes to the assessment base. These changes took effect for the quarter beginning April 1, 2011. Under the revised system, the assessment base was changed to equal average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity. Institutions other than large and highly complex institutions are placed in one of four risk categories. 

The FDIC assessment rates range from approximately 5 basis points to 45 basis points (depending on applicable adjustments for unsecured debt and brokered deposits) until such time as the FDIC&#146;s reserve ratio equals 1.15%. Once the FDIC&#146;s reserve ratio reaches 1.15% and the reserve ratio for the immediately prior assessment period is less than 2.0%, the applicable assessment rates may range from 3 basis points to 30 basis points (subject to applicable adjustments for unsecured debt and brokered deposits). If the prior assessment period is equal to or greater than 2.0% and less than 2.5%, the assessment rates may range from 2 basis points to 28 basis points and if the prior assessment period is greater than 2.5%, the assessment rates may range from 1 basis point to 25 basis points. The minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund has increased to 1.35% of estimated annual insured deposits or assessment base, however, the FDIC is directed to &#147;offset the effect&#148; of the increased reserve ratio for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. 

Future changes in insurance premiums could have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations and we cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. 

The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including us, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent 

&#160; 

termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. Management is not aware of any existing circumstances that would result in termination of our deposit insurance. 

Federal Reserve System 

Pursuant to regulations of the Federal Reserve, a savings institution must maintain reserves against its transaction accounts. During 2015, no reserves were required to be maintained on the first $14.5 million of transaction accounts, reserves of 3% were required to be maintained against the next $89.1 million of transaction accounts and a reserve of 10% was required to be maintained against all remaining transaction accounts. These percentages are subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve. Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in a non-interest bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank, the effect of the reserve requirement may reduce the amount of an institution&#146;s interest-earning assets. 

CEO pay ratio disclosure 

On August 5, 2015, the SEC adopted a new rule requiring public companies to disclose the CEO&#146;s annual total compensation, the annual total compensation of the company&#146;s median employee and the ratio of these two amounts in certain SEC filings that require executive compensation information. With certain exceptions, registrants must comply with this rule for the first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
