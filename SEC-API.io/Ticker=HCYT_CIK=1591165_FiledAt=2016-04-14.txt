 ITEM 1. BUSI NESS 

Overview 

&#160; 

MedoveX was incorporated in Nevada on July 30, 2013 as Spinez Corp. MedoveX is the parent company of Debride Inc., (&#8220;Debride&#8221;), which was incorporated under the laws of Florida on October 1, 2012, but did not commence operations until February 1, 2013. Spinez Corp. changed its name to MedoveX Corp. and effected a 2-for-1 reverse split of its stock in March, 2014. 

The goal of the Company is to obtain, develop and commercialize various intellectual property rights (patents, patent applications, knowhow, etc.) in the medical technology area, with particular focus on the development of medical devices. We intend to leverage the extensive experience of our board of directors and management team in the medical industry to seek out product candidates for licensing, acquisition or development. On March 11, 2015, we filed a Form 8-K to disclose that we entered into an agreement to acquire Streamline, Inc., and on March 25, 2015, we consummated the acquisition. 

The DenerveX Device 

Our first acquisition was the DenerveX device. We believe that the DenerveX device can be developed to encompass a number of medical applications, including pain relief. 

&#160; 

The Company acquired the DenerveX patent on January 31, 2013 from Scott Haufe, M.D. (&#8220;Dr. Haufe&#8221;), a director of the Company, in exchange for 750,108 shares of common stock in the Company and a 1% royalty on all sales of any product sold based on the patent. In September 2013, we entered into a Co-Development Agreement with James Andrews, M.D. (&#8220;Dr. Andrews&#8221;), a director of the Company, whereby Dr. Andrews committed to further evaluate the DenerveX device and to seek to make modifications and improvements to such technology. In exchange for such services, the Company agreed to pay Dr. Andrews a royalty equal to two (2%) percent of the DenerveX net sales during the five (5) year term of the Co-Development Agreement. Upon the termination of the term of the Co-Development Agreement, which has a minimum term of five (5) years, then the royalty payable to Dr. Andrews shall be reduced to one (1%) percent of DenerveX net sales after such termination of products covered by any U.S. patent on which Dr. Andrews is listed as a co-inventor; if any such patents are obtained. Such one (1%) percent royalty shall continue during the effectiveness of such patent. Pursuant to the Co-Development Agreement, Dr. Andrews agreed to assign any modifications or improvements to the DenerveX to the Company subject to the royalty rights described above. 

&#160; 

Our intention is to market the product as a disposable, single-use kit which will include all components of the DenerveX product. In addition to the DenerveX device itself, we are developing a dedicated Electro Surgical Generator to power the DenerveX device. The generator would be provided to customers agreeing to purchase the DenerveX device, and could not be used for any other purpose. 

We accepted a proposal from Devicix, a Minneapolis, Minnesota third party design and development firm, in November 2013, to develop a prototype device. This proposal included a 5 phase development plan, culminating in the production of a prototype that could be used for validation purposes. Currently we are in the build and test phase of the device, which focuses on completion of the product design verification testing, design optimization as required, and the completion of manufacturing transfer. Through December 31, 2015, we have paid approximately $1,066,000 to Devicix. 

In November 2014, we selected Nortech Systems Inc. (&#8220;Nortech&#8221;), a Minneapolis, Minnesota based U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) registered contract manufacturer, to produce 315 DenerveX devices from the prototype supplied by Devicix for use in final development and clinical trials. Our agreement with Nortech includes agreed-upon per unit prices for delivery of the devices. Actual work on development of the final units began in November 2014. Through December 31, 2015, we have paid approximately $289,000 to Nortech. 

Also in November 2014, we engaged Bovie Medical Corporation (&#8220;Bovie&#8221;), a Delaware Corporation, to develop our Electro Surgical Generator and provide post production support services. Per our agreement with Bovie, we are invoiced based on deliverables produced by Bovie, which will amount to $295,000 upon completion of all the deliverables. Through December 31, 2015, we have paid $287,000 to Bovie towards the $295,000 total. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Streamline, Inc . Merger 

On March 9, 2015, the Board of Directors of Medovex and Streamline, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (&#8220;Streamline&#8221;), approved an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;). 

On March 24, 2015, Streamline shareholders approved the Merger Agreement and the transaction was closed immediately thereafter. Under the Merger Agreement, STML Merger Sub, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of Medovex, merged into Streamline, after which Streamline became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Medovex. Streamline is in the business of designing, developing, manufacturing and marketing 510(k) and 510(k) exempt products for use in the medical field. Medovex intends, although there can be no assurance, to enter into a marketing agreement with a leading hospital bed manufacturer to market Streamline&#8217;s patented IV Suspension System as an option with its hospital beds, and pursue other marketing opportunities for the product. Our President and Chief Operating Officer, Patrick Kullmann, was formerly the Chief Executive Officer of Streamline. However, Mr. Kullmann held no securities of Streamline. 

&#160; 

All Streamline dilutive securities were either exercised or terminated prior to the closing, resulting in 4,709,491 shares of Streamline&#8217;s common stock outstanding immediately prior to closing. Net proceeds from these exercises (after statutory withholdings and certain transaction expenses) were included in the amount of cash available to Streamline stockholders. Each share of Streamline common stock may be exchanged by its holder for approximately $0.29 in cash and approximately 0.35 shares of Medovex common stock after submitting properly executed documents to a 3 rd party paying agent. All Streamline holders have submitted the proper documents to the paying agent with the exception of 2 holders representing 2,596 shares of Medovex stock. Additionally, 200,000 shares of Medovex common stock is being held in escrow until September 24, 2016 to secure Streamline&#8217;s indemnification obligations under the Merger Agreement. 

Assuming the remaining Streamline shareholders submit their documents, this transaction resulted in the issuance of 1,875,000 shares of Medovex common stock, (including the 200,000 shares being held in escrow) and the distribution of approximately $1,325,000 of cash to Streamline shareholders. The terms of the Merger Agreement also required a commitment by Medovex to supply a minimum of $750,000 in working capital to the Streamline subsidiary. 

&#160; 

The IV Suspension System ("ISS") 

On March 24, 2015, we acquired the patent rights to the Streamline ISS product as part of the Company&#8217;s acquisition of Streamline. There are no royalties or other commitments associated with the sale of this product. The product has already been manufactured at a contract facility in North Dakota and requires no regulatory approval for sale. The ISS is a system designed to allow the transportation of IV poles secured to hospital beds such that one person could move a patient without fear of separating the IV pole from the patient during transport. 

While there are several &#8220;bed and boom&#8221; transfer systems on the market, we are not aware of any that take the Streamline patented approach to addressing IV pole transportation. Nevertheless, other bed transportation products have been on the market longer and have larger organizations marketing their products. The hospital market in general is highly competitive, and introducing any new product is difficult and time consuming. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

Developing and commercializing new products is highly competitive. The market is characterized by extensive research and clinical efforts and rapid technological change. We face intense competition worldwide from medical device, biomedical technology and medical products and combination products companies, including major medical products companies. We may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products. Most of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, distribution, manufacturing and technological resources. These competitors may also be in the process of seeking FDA or other regulatory approvals, or patent protection, for new products. Our competitors may commercialize new products in advance of our products. Our products also face competition from numerous existing products and procedures, which currently are considered part of the standard of care. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the quality of outcomes for medical conditions; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

acceptance by surgeons and the medical device market generally; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

ease of use and reliability; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

technical leadership and superiority; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

effective marketing and distribution; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

speed to market; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

product price and qualification for coverage and reimbursement. 

&#160; 

We will also compete in the marketplace to recruit and retain qualified scientific, management and sales personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies and licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our business. 

We are aware of several companies that compete or are developing technologies in our current and future products areas. With regard to the DenerveX device, we believe that our principal competitors include device manufacturers Cosman Medical Inc., Stryker Corporation and Spembly Medical Systems. We may also face competition from developing, but potentially untested technologies such as Zyga&#8217;s GLYDER device. In order to compete effectively, our products will have to achieve widespread market acceptance, receive adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement, be cost effective and be simultaneously safe and effective. 

While there are several &#8220;bed and boom&#8221; transfer systems on the market, we are not aware of any that take the Streamline patented approach to addressing IV pole transportation. Nevertheless, other bed transportation products have been on the market longer and have larger organizations marketing their products. The hospital market in general is highly competitive, and introducing any new product is difficult and time consuming. 

Customers 

Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. We estimate selling the DenerveX in Europe before the United States. We will utilize the experience of distributors in the countries we opt to market in to decide the best approach to selling the DenerveX within their respective countries. Information gleaned from the European sales should help finalize our approach for sales in the United States. 

Initially we plan to market Streamline&#8217;s IV Suspension System to hospitals exclusively via a marketing agreement with a major hospital bed manufacturer. This arrangement will be evaluated over the course of the year to gauge its effectiveness. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

A key element of our success depends on our ability to identify and create proprietary medical device technologies. In order to proactively protect those proprietary technologies, we intend to continue to develop and enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, trademarks and copyrights, as available through registration in the United States and internationally, as well as through the use of trade secrets, domain names and contractual agreements such as confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements. 

&#160; 

Currently, our intellectual property rights include the intellectual property acquired from Debride, Inc., which includes the U.S. Patent 8,167,879 B2 (the &#8220;Patent&#8221;). The Patent was originally filed in 2009 and was issued on May 1, 2012. We intend to leverage the Patent to the fullest extent possible through market development and prosecution of our rights under the Patent. 

As a result of our acquisition of Streamline, we acquired the rights to U.S. Patents 7,497,407 B2 (issued March 3, 2009), 7,735,789 B2 (issued June 15, 2010), and 7,918,422 B2 (issued April 5, 2011), all related to Streamline's Transformable Intravenous Pole. We believe these patents provide intellectual property protection for the product line acquired from Streamline. 

In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we intend to file counterpart patent applications in additional countries where we think such foreign filing is warranted. 

&#160; 

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent&#8217;s term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays in patent prosecution by the patentee, and a patent&#8217;s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent. 

&#160; 

We intend to continually re-assess and fine-tune our intellectual property strategy in order to fortify our position in our market space in the United States and internationally. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications should our intellectual property strategy require such filings and/or where we seek to adapt to competition or seize business opportunities. Further, we are prepared to file patent applications relating to any other products that we develop or require soon after the experimental data necessary for a strong application become available and our cost-benefit analyses justifies filing such applications. 

Many biotechnology companies and academic institutions are competing with us in the medical device field and filing patent applications potentially relevant to our business. Internally, we have established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business. Also, we generally require employees to assign patents and other intellectual property to us as a condition of employment with us. 

In order to contend with the inevitable possibility of third party intellectual property conflicts, from time to time, we will review and assess the third-party intellectual property landscape for competitive and other developments that may inform or impact our intellectual property development and commercialization strategies. We may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from third party intellectual property holders. Where licenses are readily available at reasonable cost, such licenses are considered a normal cost of doing business. In other instances, however, where a third party holds relevant property and is a direct competitor, a license might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or available at all. We will attempt to manage the risk that such third party intellectual property may pose by conducting, among other measures, freedom-to-operate studies to guide our early-stage research away from areas where we are likely to encounter obstacles in the form of third party intellectual property. 

Government Regulations 

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Any product that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Opportunities Created by Healthcare Legislation 

We anticipate that recent healthcare legislation will create greater opportunities for cost-effective providers of healthcare. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the &#8220;PPACA&#8221;) and other related healthcare reform activities seek to expand coverage to a broader range of patients. Since insurance coverage reduces the out-of-pocket expense for physician visits, patients will be better able to afford visits to the doctor and accordingly, the number of physician visits is projected to rebound as health insurance exchanges and subsidization of insurance premiums were established between roughly 2% and 9.5% of total house hold Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) for individuals with income less than 100% - 400% of the poverty line. 

Additionally, PPACA accomplishes its proposed expansion of coverage to previously uninsured individuals through a significant loosening of the eligibility criteria for enrollment in Medicaid. As Americans grow older and live longer, we expect there will be greater public and private spending on healthcare, which is expected to help hospitals afford to upgrade their equipment in order to speed surgical processes while lowering associated risks, such as infection and recovery time. Consequently, areas of strongest growth in the hospital market will be in medical devices that treat age-related illnesses, such as those that are likely to seek reimbursement through Medicaid, and those devices that help hospitals achieve faster procedures while lowering the associated risks as discussed above. 

FDA Regulation 

The DenerveX and any other product we may develop must be approved or cleared by the FDA before it is marketed in the United States. Before and after approval or clearance in the United States, our products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and/or the Public Health Service Act, as well as by other regulatory bodies. FDA regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, storage, record-keeping, market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, import and export, marketing and sales, and distribution of medical devices and products. 

In the United States, the FDA subjects medical products to rigorous review. If we do not comply with applicable requirements, we may be fined, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or to allow us to manufacture or market our products, and we may be criminally prosecuted. Failure to comply with the law could result in, among other things, warning letters, civil penalties, delays in approving or refusal to approve a product, product recall, product seizure, interruption of production, operating restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of product approval, injunctions, or criminal prosecution. 

FDA Approval or Clearance of Medical Devices 

In the United States, medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the extent of controls the FDA determines are necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and efficacy: 

&#183; 

Class I: general controls, such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; 

&#183; 

Class II: special controls, pre-market notification (often referred to as a 510(k) application), specific controls such as performance standards, patient registries, post market surveillance, additional controls such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; and 

&#183; 

Class III: special controls and approval of a pre-market approval (&#8220;PMA&#8221;) application. 

&#160; 

In general, the higher the classification, the greater the time and cost to obtain approval to market. There are no &#8220;standardized&#8221; requirements for approval, even within each class. For example, the FDA could grant 510(k) status, but require a human clinical trial, a typical requirement of a PMA. They could also initially assign a device Class III status, but end up approving a device as a 510(k) device if certain requirements are met. The range of the number and expense of the various requirements is significant. The quickest and least expensive pathway would be 510(k) approval with a just a review of existing data. The longest and most expensive path would be a PMA with extensive randomized human clinical trials. We cannot predict how the FDA will classify the DenerveX device, nor predict what requirements will be placed upon us to obtain market approval, or even if they will approve the DenerveX device at all. However, we believe the pathway that will be required by the FDA will be somewhere between the two extremes described above. 

&#160; 

We intend to apply to the FDA for 510(k) clearance for our DenerveX device. However, it is very possible the FDA will deny this request and require the more expensive PMA process. The Company has budgeted based on the assumption that the PMA process will be required. To request marketing authorization by means of a 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to another currently legally marketed medical device, has the same intended use, and is as safe and effective as a currently legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than does a currently legally marketed device. 510(k) submissions generally include, among other things, a description of the device and its manufacturing, device labeling, medical devices to which the device is substantially equivalent, safety and biocompatibility information, and the results of performance testing. In some cases, a 510(k) submission must include data from human clinical studies. We believe that other medical devices which have been approved by the FDA have many aspects that are substantially similar to the DenerveX device, which may make obtaining 510(k) clearance possible. Marketing may commence only when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding substantial equivalence. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any product modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the product, or that would constitute a significant change in intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, if the device would no longer be substantially equivalent, would require PMA. In addition, any additional claims the Company wished to make at a later date, such as the permanent relief of pain, may require a PMA. If the FDA determines that the product does not qualify for 510(k) clearance, they will issue a Not Substantially Equivalent letter, at which point the Company must submit and the FDA must approve a PMA before marketing can begin. 

During the review of a 510(k) submission, the FDA may request more information or additional studies and may decide that the indications for which we seek approval or clearance should be limited. In addition, laws and regulations and the interpretation of those laws and regulations by the FDA may change in the future. We cannot foresee what effect, if any, such changes may have on us. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

European Union Approvals 

The EU will require a CE mark certification or approval in order to market the DenerveX device in the various countries of the European Union or other countries outside the United States. To obtain CE mark certification of the device, we will be required to work with an accredited European notified body organization to determine the appropriate documents required to support certification in accordance with existing medical device directive. The predictability of the length of time and cost associated with such a CE marketing may vary, or may include lengthy clinical trials to support such a marking. Once the CE mark is obtained, a company may market the device in the countries of the EU. We have targeted the submission of our application for CE marketing in 2016. Management believes it will be able to obtain European CE mark approval to market the DenerveX device before it will obtain FDA approval. The Company has retained third party experts to assist with the European approval. Management will be interviewing potential European distributors and will likely retain a European sales manager to assist the distributor and promote the product in Europe. 

Clinical Trials of Medical Devices 

One or more clinical trials are becoming necessary to support an FDA submission. Clinical studies of unapproved or uncleared medical devices or devices being studied for uses for which they are not approved or cleared (investigational devices) must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients, the sponsor company must submit an Investigational Device Exemption, or "IDE" application to the FDA prior to initiation of the clinical study. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device on humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. Clinical studies of investigational devices may not begin until an institutional review board ("IRB") has approved the study. 

During any study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA&#8217;s IDE requirements. These requirements include investigator selection, trial monitoring, adverse event reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. We, the FDA, or the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being conducted, may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable risk. During the approval or clearance process, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of one or more investigational sites participating in the study supporting the application. 

Post-Approval Regulation of Medical Devices 

After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 

&#183; 

the FDA Quality Systems Regulation ("QSR"), which governs, among other things, how manufacturers design, test, manufacture, exercise quality control over, and document manufacturing of their products; 

&#183; 

labeling and claims regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires reporting to the FDA of certain adverse experiences associated with use of the product. 

&#160; 

We will continue to be subject to inspection by the FDA to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements. 

Manufacturing cGMP Requirements 

Manufacturers of medical devices are required to comply with FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") set forth in the quality system regulations promulgated under section 520 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or in product withdrawal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following the approval. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

International Regulation 

We are subject to regulations and product registration requirements in many foreign countries in which we may seek to sell our products, including in the areas of product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import and export restrictions and tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements. 

European Good Manufacturing Practices 

In the European Union, the manufacture of medical devices is subject to good manufacturing practice ("GMP"), as set forth in the relevant laws and guidelines of the European Union and its member states. Compliance with GMP is generally assessed by the competent regulatory authorities. Typically, quality system evaluation is performed by a Notified Body, which also recommends to the relevant competent authority for the European Community CE Marking of a device. The Competent Authority may conduct inspections of relevant facilities, and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. In addition to obtaining approval for each product, in many cases each device manufacturing facility must be audited on a periodic basis by the Notified Body. Further inspections may occur over the life of the product. 

Our third party manufacturer has ISO certification which is generally one of the requirements for approval under the guidelines established in the European Union. 

&#160; 

United States Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws 

In the United States, there are Federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in Federal healthcare programs. These laws are potentially applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA as medical devices, and hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of such products. Other provisions of Federal and state laws provide civil and criminal penalties for presenting, or causing to be presented, to third-party payers for reimbursement, claims that are false or fraudulent, or which are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. In addition, certain states have implemented regulations requiring medical device and pharmaceutical companies to report all gifts and payments of over $50 to medical practitioners. This does not apply to instances involving clinical trials. Although we intend to structure our future business relationships with clinical investigators and purchasers of our products to comply with these and other applicable laws, it is possible that some of our business practices in the future could be subject to scrutiny and challenge by Federal or state enforcement officials under these laws. 

Research, Product Development and Technical Operations Expense 

Research and development costs and expenses consist primarily of fees paid to external service providers, laboratory supplies, costs for facilities and equipment, and other costs for research and development activities. Research and development expenses are recorded in operating expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Estimates have been used in determining the expense liability of certain costs where services have been performed but not yet invoiced. We monitor levels of performance under each significant contract for external service providers, including the extent of patient enrollment and other activities through communications with the service providers to reflect the actual amount expended. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 12 total employees, 11 of which were full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a union and we believe our employee relations to be good.
