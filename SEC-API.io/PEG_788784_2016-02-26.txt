BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND STRATEGY 

PSE&#38;G 

Our regulated transmission and distribution public utility, PSE&#38;G, distributes electric energy and gas to customers within a designated service territory running diagonally across New Jersey where approximately 6.2 million &#32;people, or about 70% &#32;of 

New Jersey's population resides. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;. 

Products and Services 

Our utility operations primarily earn margins through the transmission and distribution of electricity and the distribution of gas. 

&#8226; 

Transmission &#8212;the movement of electricity at high voltage from generating plants to substations and transformers, where it is then reduced to a lower voltage for distribution to homes, businesses and industrial customers. Our revenues for these services are based upon tariffs approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). 

&#8226; 

Distribution &#8212;the delivery of electricity and gas to the retail customer&#8217;s home, business or industrial facility. Our revenues for these services are based upon tariffs approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU). 

The commodity portion of our utility business&#8217; electric and gas sales is managed by basic generation service (BGS) and basic gas supply service (BGSS) suppliers. Pricing for those services are set by the BPU as a pass-through, resulting in no margin for our utility operations. 

We also earn margins through competitive services, such as appliance repair. 

In addition to our current utility products and services, we have implemented several programs to increase the level of regulated solar generation within New Jersey, including: 

&#8226; 

programs to help finance the installation of solar power systems throughout our electric service area, and 

&#8226; 

programs to develop, own and operate solar power systems. 

We have also implemented a set of energy efficiency and demand response programs to encourage conservation and energy efficiency by providing energy and cost saving measures directly to businesses and families. For additional information concerning these programs and the components of our tariffs, see Regulatory Issues&#8212;State Regulation and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212; Note 5. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities . 

How PSE&#38;G Operates 

We are a transmission owner in PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM) and we provide distribution service to 2.2 million &#32;electric customers and 1.8 million &#32;gas customers in a service area that covers approximately 2,600 &#32;square miles running diagonally across New Jersey. We serve the most heavily populated, commercialized and industrialized territory in New Jersey, including its six &#32;largest cities and approximately 300 &#32;suburban and rural communities. 

Transmission 

We use formula rates for our transmission cost of service and investments. Formula-type rates provide a method of rate recovery where the transmission owner annually determines its revenue requirements through a fixed formula that considers Operations and Maintenance expenditures, Rate Base and capital investments and applies an approved return on equity (ROE) in developing the weighted average cost of capital. Our current approved rates provide for a base ROE of 11.68% &#32;on existing and new transmission investment, while certain investments are entitled to earn an additional incentive rate. For more information, see Regulatory Issues&#8212;Federal Regulation&#8212;Transmission Regulation.

In 2015, we completed: 

&#8226; 

the final phase of our portion of the 500 kV Susquehanna-Roseland project, bolstering electric reliability by partnering with PPL Electric Utilities (PPL) to construct a 150 mile power line between PPL's nuclear switchyard in Susquehanna, Pennsylvania and our switchyard in Roseland, New Jersey, and 

&#8226; 

our Mickleton-Gloucester-Camden project which consisted of upgrading 10 circuit miles of overhead transmission, installing approximately 16 underground circuit miles and 10 overhead circuit miles of new 230 kilovolt (kV) and modifications/upgrades at five existing stations. 

We are also continuing to execute the following projects that focus on reliability improvements and replacement of aging infrastructure which are included in the 2016-2018 capital spend of $4.7 billion &#32;for Transmission disclosed in Item 7. MD&#38;A&#8212;Capital Requirements.

(A) Excludes Contract Service Gas (CSG) rate class sales, which do not impact margin. 

The decline in electric sales is the result of changes in customer usage patterns, including conservation and more energy efficient appliances. Gas firm sales increased as a result of lower gas prices. Only gas firm sales impact margin. 

During 2015, PSE&#38;G continued to execute its BPU-approved $1.2 billion &#32;Energy Strong Program to (1) upgrade all of its electric substations that were damaged by water in recent storms; make investments that will create redundancy in the electric distribution system, reducing outages when damage occurs; and deploy technologies to better monitor system operations, enabling PSE&#38;G to restore customers more quickly in the event of an electric outage, and (2) with respect to PSE&#38;G&#8217;s gas system, replace and modernize 250 miles of low-pressure cast iron gas mains in or near flood areas and upgrade five natural gas metering stations and a liquefied natural gas station recently affected by severe weather or located in flood zones. 

In addition, in November 2015, the BPU approved our settlement with the BPU Staff and the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel regarding our Gas System Modernization Program (GSMP) through which we will invest $905 million over three years to modernize PSE&#38;G's gas systems. The GSMP will replace approximately 510 miles of cast iron and unprotected steel gas mains and about 38,000 unprotected steel service lines to homes and businesses, including the uprating of the mains to higher pressure. The mains and service lines will be replaced with stronger, more durable plastic piping, reducing the potential for leaks and release of methane gas. The new elevated pressure systems also enable the installation of excess flow valves that automatically shut off gas flow if a service line is damaged, and better support the use of high-efficiency appliances. 

Solar Generation 

In order to support New Jersey's Energy Master Plan and the state's renewable energy goals, we have undertaken two major solar initiatives at PSE&#38;G, the Solar Loan Program and the Solar 4 All and Solar 4 All Extension Programs. Our Solar Loan Program provides solar system financing to our residential and commercial customers. The loans are repaid with cash or solar renewable energy certificates (SRECs). We sell the SRECs used to repay the loans through a periodic auction, the proceeds of which are used to offset program costs. Our Solar 4 All Programs invest in utility-owned solar photovoltaic (PV) centralized solar systems installed on PSE&#38;G property and third party sites, including landfill facilities, and solar panels installed on distribution system poles in our electric service territory. We sell the energy and capacity from the systems in the PJM wholesale electricity market. In addition, we sell SRECs generated by the projects through the same periodic auction used in the loan program, the proceeds of which are used to offset program costs. As of December 31, 2015 , we have invested an aggregate of approximately $818 million &#32;in both solar programs. 

Supply 

Although commodity revenues make up almost 41% &#32;of our revenues, we make no margin on the default supply of electricity and gas since the actual costs are passed through to our customers. 

All electric and gas customers in New Jersey have the ability to choose their own electric energy and/or gas supplier. Pursuant to BPU requirements, we serve as the supplier of last resort for two types of electric and gas customers within our service territory that are not served by another supplier. The first type, which represents about 80% &#32;of PSE&#38;G&#8217;s load requirements, provides default supply service for smaller industrial and commercial customers and residential customers at seasonally-adjusted fixed prices for a three-year term (BGS-Residential Small Commercial Pricing (RSCP)). These rates change annually on June 1 and are based on the average price obtained at auctions in the current year and two prior years. The second type provides default supply for larger customers, with energy priced at hourly PJM real-time market prices for a contract term of 12 months (BGS-Commercial Industrial Energy Pricing (CIEP)). 

We procure the supply to meet our BGS obligations through auctions authorized by the BPU for New Jersey&#8217;s total BGS requirement. These auctions take place annually in February. Results of these auctions determine which energy suppliers are authorized to supply BGS to New Jersey&#8217;s electric distribution companies (EDCs). Once validated by the BPU, electricity prices for BGS service are set. Approximately one-third of PSE&#38;G&#8217;s total BGS-RSCP eligible load is auctioned each year for a three-year term. For information on current prices, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212; Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities . 

PSE&#38;G procures the supply requirements of its default service BGSS gas customers through a full-requirements contract with Power. The BPU has approved a mechanism designed to recover all gas commodity costs related to BGSS for residential customers. BGSS filings are made annually by June 1 of each year, with an effective date of October 1. PSE&#38;G&#8217;s revenues are matched with its costs using deferral accounting, with the goal of achieving a zero cumulative balance by September 30 of each year. In addition, we have the ability to put in place two self-implementing BGSS increases on December 1 and February 1 of up to 5% and also may reduce the BGSS rate at any time and/or provide bill credits. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212; Note 5. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities &#32;for information on recent self-implementing credits. Any difference between rates charged under the BGSS contract and rates charged to our residential customers is deferred and collected or refunded through adjustments in future rates. Commercial and industrial customers that do not select third party suppliers are also supplied under the BGSS arrangement. These customers are charged a market-based price largely determined by prices for commodity futures contracts. 

Markets and Market Pricing 

Historically, there has been significant volatility in commodity prices. Such volatility can have a considerable impact on us since a rising commodity price environment results in higher delivered electric and gas rates for customers. This could result in decreased demand for electricity and gas, increased regulatory pressures and greater working capital requirements as the collection of higher commodity costs from our customers may be deferred under our regulated rate structure. A declining commodity price on the other hand, would be expected to have the opposite effect. For additional information, including the 

impact of natural gas commodity prices on electricity prices such as BGS, see Item 7. MD&#38;A&#8212;Executive Overview of 2015 &#32;and Future Outlook. 

Power 

Through Power, we seek to produce low-cost electricity by efficiently operating our nuclear, coal, gas, oil-fired and renewable generation assets while balancing generation output, fuel requirements and supply obligations through energy portfolio management. We use the generation we own combined with commodity contracts and financial instruments to cover our commitments for BGS in New Jersey and other bilateral supply contract agreements. 

Products and Services 

As a merchant generator, our profit is derived from selling a range of products and services under contract to power marketers and to others, such as investor-owned and municipal utilities, and to aggregators who resell energy to retail consumers, or in the open market. These products and services include: 

&#8226; 

Energy &#8212;the electrical output produced by generation plants that is ultimately delivered to customers for use in lighting, heating, air conditioning and operation of other electrical equipment. Energy is our principal product and is priced on a usage basis, typically in cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) or dollars per megawatt hour (MWh). 

&#8226; 

Capacity &#8212;distinct from energy, capacity is a market commitment that a given generation unit will be available to an Independent System Operator (ISO) for dispatch to produce energy when it is needed to meet system demand. Capacity is typically priced in dollars per MW for a given sale period (e.g. day or month). 

&#8226; 

Ancillary Services &#8212;related activities supplied by generation unit owners to the wholesale market that are required by the ISO to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the bulk power system. Owners of generation units may bid units into the ancillary services market in return for compensatory payments. Costs to pay generators for ancillary services are recovered through charges collected from market participants. 

&#8226; 

Emissions Allowances and Congestion Credits &#8212;Emissions allowances (or credits) represent the right to emit a specific amount of certain pollutants. Allowance trading is used to control air pollution by providing economic incentives for achieving reductions in the emissions of pollutants. Congestion credits (or Financial Transmission Rights) are financial instruments that entitle the holder to a stream of revenues (or charges) based on the hourly congestion price differences across a transmission path. 

Power also sells wholesale natural gas, primarily through a full-requirements BGSS contract with PSE&#38;G to meet the gas supply requirements of PSE&#38;G's customers. On March 19, 2014, the BPU approved an extension of the long-term BGSS contract to March 31, 2019 and then year-to-year thereafter unless terminated by either party with a two year notice. 

Approximately 45% &#32;of PSE&#38;G&#8217;s peak daily gas requirements is provided from Power&#8217;s firm gas transportation capacity, which is available every day of the year. Power satisfies the remainder of PSE&#38;G&#8217;s requirements from storage contracts, liquefied natural gas, seasonal purchases, contract peaking supply and propane. Based upon the availability of natural gas beyond PSE&#38;G's daily needs, Power sells gas to others and uses it for its generation fleet. 

In addition to its nuclear and fossil generation fleet, Power owns and operates 148 &#32;MW direct current (dc) of PV solar generation facilities and has a 50% ownership interest in a 208 MW oil-fired generation facility in Hawaii. 

The remainder of this section about Power covers our nuclear and fossil fleet in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions which comprises the vast majority of Power&#8217;s operations and financial performance. 

How Power Operates 

Nearly all of our generation capacity consists of nuclear and fossil generation ( 11,678 &#32;MW) that is located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States in some of the country&#8217;s largest and most developed electricity markets. For additional information see Item 2. Properties. 

The map below shows the locations of our Northeast and Mid-Atlantic nuclear and fossil generation facilities: 

&#8226; 

Generation Capacity 

Our nuclear and fossil installed capacity utilizes a diverse mix of fuels: 42% &#32;gas, 32% &#32;nuclear, 21% &#32;coal, 4% &#32;oil and 1% &#32;pumped storage. This fuel diversity helps to mitigate risks associated with fuel price volatility and market demand cycles. Our total generating output in 2015 &#32;was approximately 55,000 &#32;GWh. The generation mix by fuel type in recent years has reflected the relatively more favorable price of natural gas compared to coal, making it more economical to run certain of our gas units in place of our coal units. The following table indicates the proportionate share of generating output by fuel type in 2015 . &#160;

Generation Dispatch 

Our generation units are typically characterized as serving one or more of three general energy market segments: base load; load following; and peaking, based on their operating capability and performance. On a capacity basis, our portfolio of generation assets consists of 39% &#32;base load, 49% &#32;load following and 12% &#32;peaking. This diversity helps to reduce the risk associated with market demand cycles and allows us to participate in the market at each segment of the dispatch curve.

Base Load Units &#32;run the most and typically are called to operate whenever they are available. These units generally derive revenues from both energy and capacity sales. Variable operating costs are low due to the combination of highly efficient operations and the use of relatively lower-cost fuels. Performance is generally measured by the unit&#8217;s &#8220;capacity factor,&#8221; or the ratio of the actual output to the theoretical maximum output. In 2015 , our base load capacity factors were as follows:

Load Following Units &#32;typically operate between 20% &#32;and 70% &#32;of the time. The operating costs are generally higher per unit of output than for base load units due to the use of higher-cost fuels such as oil, natural gas and, in some cases, coal or lower overall unit efficiency. These units usually have more flexible operating characteristics than base load units which enable them to more easily follow fluctuations in load. They operate less frequently than base load units and derive revenues from energy, capacity and ancillary services. 

&#8226; 

Peaking Units &#32;run the least amount of time and in some cases may utilize higher-priced fuels. These units typically operate less than 20% &#32;of the time but can typically start very quickly in response to system needs. Costs per unit of output tend to be higher than for base load units given the combination of higher heat rates and fuel costs. The majority of revenues are from capacity and ancillary service sales. The characteristics of these units enable them to capture energy revenues during periods of high energy prices. 

In the energy markets in which we operate, owners of power plants specify to the ISO prices at which they are prepared to generate and sell energy based on the marginal cost of generating energy from each individual unit. The ISOs will generally dispatch in merit order, calling on the lowest variable cost units first and dispatching progressively higher-cost units until the point that the entire system demand for power (known as the system &#8220;load&#8221;) is satisfied reliably. Base load units are dispatched first, with load following units next, followed by peaking units. 

During periods when one or more parts of the transmission grid are operating at full capability, thereby resulting in a constraint on the transmission system, it may not be possible to dispatch units in merit order without violating transmission reliability standards. Under such circumstances, the ISO may dispatch higher-cost generation out of merit order within the congested area and power suppliers will be paid an increased Locational Marginal Price (LMP) in congested areas, reflecting the bid prices of those higher-cost generation units. 

The following chart depicts the unconstrained merit order of dispatch of our units in PJM, the ISO in the region where most of our generation units are located, based on illustrative historical dispatch cost. It should be noted that the low price of natural gas has resulted in changes in market price fluctuations from historical norms, wherein some gas-fired generation is now able to displace some coal-fired generation in the load-following portion of the curve. 

(A) 

The National Park, Sewaren 6, Mercer 3, Salem 3, Burlington 8 and 11, Bergen 3, Edison 1, 2 and 3 and Essex 10, 11 and 12 peaking units were retired in June 2015. Salem 3 continues to be used as an emergency backup generator for the Salem nuclear site. 

(B) 

Keys Energy Center and Sewaren 7, which will replace Sewaren Units 1, 2, 3 and 4, are expected to be added to dispatch in 2018. Bridgeport Harbor Station 5 is scheduled to be added to dispatch in 2019. See Major Growth Projects above. 

The size of each facility's circle in the above chart illustrates the relative MW generating capacity of that facility. For additional information on each of our generation facilities, see Item 2. Properties. 

Typically, the bid price of the last unit dispatched by an ISO establishes the energy market-clearing price. After considering the market-clearing price and the effect of transmission congestion and other factors, the ISO calculates the LMP for every location in the system. The ISO pays all units that are dispatched their respective LMP for each MWh of energy produced, regardless of their specific bid prices. Since bids generally approximate the marginal cost of production, units with lower marginal costs typically generate higher operating profits than units with comparatively higher marginal costs. 

This method of determining supply and pricing creates a situation where natural gas prices often have a major influence on the price that generators will receive for their output, especially in periods of relatively strong or weak demand. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gas will often translate into changes in the wholesale price of electricity. This can be seen in the following graphs which present historical annual spot prices and forward calendar prices as averaged over each year at two liquid trading hubs. 

Historical data implies that the price of natural gas will continue to have a strong influence on the price of electricity in the primary markets in which we operate. 

The prices reflected in the preceding graphs above do not necessarily illustrate our contract prices, but they are representative of market prices at relatively liquid hubs, with nearer-term forward pricing generally resulting from more liquid markets than pricing for later years. In addition, the prices do not reflect locational differences resulting from congestion or other factors, such as the availability of natural gas from the Marcellus and other shale-gas regions, which can be considerable. While these prices provide some perspective on past and future prices, the forward prices are volatile and there can be no assurance that such prices will remain in effect or that we will be able to contract output at these forward prices. 

Fuel Supply 

&#8226; 

Nuclear Fuel Supply &#8212;We have long-term contracts for nuclear fuel. These contracts provide for: 

&#8226; 

purchase of uranium (concentrates and uranium hexafluoride), 

&#8226; 

conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, 

&#8226; 

enrichment of uranium hexafluoride, and 

&#8226; 

fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies. 

&#8226; 

Coal Supply &#8212;Our Keystone, Conemaugh and Bridgeport stations operate on coal. Our Hudson and Mercer stations have the ability to operate on both coal and natural gas. Coal is delivered to our units through a combination of rail, truck, barge and ocean shipments. 

In order to control emissions levels, our Bridgeport 3 unit uses a specific type of coal obtained from Indonesia. We currently have a coal supply contract from Indonesia under contract through 2017 for the Bridgeport facility and believe that additional coal would be available after 2017 as required. 

&#8226; 

Gas Supply &#8212;Natural gas is the primary fuel for the bulk of our load following and peaking fleet. We purchase gas directly from natural gas producers and marketers. These supplies are transported to New Jersey by four &#32;interstate pipelines with which we have contracted. In addition, we have firm gas transportation contracts to serve a portion of the gas requirements for our BEC station in New York. 

We have 1.3 billion &#32;cubic feet-per-day of firm transportation capacity and 0.9 billion &#32;cubic feet-per-day of firm storage delivery under contract to meet our obligations under the BGSS contract. This capacity includes approximately 0.6 billion &#32;cubic feet-per-day of access to the northeast Pennsylvania Marcellus shale gas region. On an as-available basis, this firm transportation capacity may also be used to serve the gas supply needs of our generation fleet. 

Power has contracted for approximately 125 million cubic feet-per-day of delivery capability on the PennEast Pipeline from eastern Pennsylvania to New Jersey with a targeted in-service date of November 2017. This additional delivery capability will be used to supplement the BGSS contract. 

&#8226; 

Oil &#8212;Oil is used as the primary fuel for one &#32;load following steam unit and four &#32;combustion turbine peaking units and can be used as an alternate fuel by several load following and peaking units that have dual-fuel capability. Oil for operations is drawn from on-site storage and is generally purchased on the spot market and delivered by truck or barge. 

We expect to be able to meet the fuel supply demands of our customers and our own operations. However, the ability to maintain an adequate fuel supply could be affected by several factors not within our control, including changes in prices and demand, curtailments by suppliers, severe weather, environmental regulations, and other factors. For additional information, see Item 7. MD&#38;A&#8212;Executive Overview of 2015 &#32;and Future Outlook and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212; Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities . 

Markets and Market Pricing 

The vast majority of Power&#8217;s generation assets are located in three centralized, competitive electricity markets operated by ISO organizations all of which are subject to the regulatory oversight of FERC: 

&#8226; 

PJM Regional Transmission Organization &#8212;PJM conducts the largest centrally dispatched energy market in North America. It serves over 61 million &#32;people, nearly 19% &#32;of the total United States population, and has a record peak demand of 165,492 &#32;MW. The PJM Interconnection coordinates the movement of electricity through all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. The majority of our generating stations operate in PJM. 

&#8226; 

&#32;&#32;New York &#8212;The New York ISO (NYISO) is the market coordinator for New York State and is responsible for managing the New York Power Pool and for administering its energy marketplace. This service area has a population of about 19 million &#32;and a record peak demand of 33,956 MW . Our BEC station operates in New York. 

&#8226; 

New England &#8212;The ISO-New England (ISO-NE) is the market coordinator for the New England Power Pool and for administering its energy marketplace which covers Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. This service area has a population of about 14 million &#32;and a record peak demand of 28,130 &#32;MW. Our Bridgeport and New Haven stations operate in Connecticut. 

The price of electricity varies by location in each of these markets. Depending upon our production and our obligations, these price differentials may increase or decrease our profitability. 

Commodity prices, such as electricity, gas, coal, oil and emissions, as well as the availability of our diverse fleet of generation units to operate, also have a considerable effect on our profitability. These commodity prices have been, and continue to be, subject to significant market volatility. Over the long-term, the higher the forward prices are, the more attractive an 

environment exists for us to contract for the sale of our anticipated output. However, higher prices also increase the cost of replacement power; thereby placing us at greater risk should our generating units fail to operate effectively or otherwise become unavailable. 

Over the past few years, lower wholesale natural gas prices have resulted in lower electric energy prices. One of the reasons for the lower natural gas prices is greater supply from more recently-developed sources, such as shale gas, much of which is produced in adjacent states (e.g. Pennsylvania). This trend has reduced margin on forward sales as we re-contract our expected generation output. 

In addition to energy sales, we earn revenue from capacity payments for our generating assets. These payments are compensation for committing our generating units to the ISO for dispatch at its discretion. Capacity payments reflect the value to the ISO of assurance that there will be sufficient generating capacity available at all times to meet system reliability and energy requirements. Currently, there is sufficient capacity in the markets in which we operate. However, in certain areas of these markets there are transmission system transfer limitations which raise concerns about reliability and create a more acute need for capacity. 

In PJM and ISO-NE, where we operate most of our generation, the market design for capacity payments provides for a structured, forward-looking, transparent capacity pricing mechanism. This is through the Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) in PJM and the Forward Capacity Market (FCM) in ISO-NE. These mechanisms provide greater transparency regarding the value of capacity and provide a pricing signal to prospective investors in new generating facilities so as to encourage expansion of capacity to meet future market demands. 

The prices to be received by generating units in PJM for capacity have been set through RPM base residual and incremental auctions and depend upon the zone in which the generating unit is located. For each delivery year, the prices differ in the various areas of PJM, depending on the transfer limitations of the transmission system in each area. Keystone and Conemaugh receive lower capacity prices than the majority of our PJM generating units since there are fewer constraints in that region and our generating units in New Jersey usually receive higher pricing. 

Our PJM generating units are located in several zones and Power expects to realize the following average capacity prices from the base and incremental auctions which have been completed:

&#160; 

The price that must be paid by an entity serving load in the various zones is also set through these auctions. These prices can be higher or lower than the prices noted in the table above due to import and export capability to and from lower-priced areas. 

We have obtained price certainty for our PJM capacity through May 2019 &#32;and New England capacity through May 2020 &#32;through the RPM and FCM pricing mechanisms, respectively. 

Like PJM and ISO-NE, the NYISO provides capacity payments to its generating units, but unlike the other two markets, the New York market does not provide a forward price signal beyond a six month auction period. 

On a prospective basis, many factors may affect the capacity pricing, including but not limited to: 

&#8226; 

load and demand, 

&#8226; 

availability of generating capacity (including retirements, additions, derates and forced outage rates), 

&#8226; 

capacity imports from external regions, 

&#8226; 

transmission capability between zones, 

&#8226; 

available amounts of demand response resources, 

&#8226; 

pricing mechanisms, including potentially increasing the number of zones to create more pricing sensitivity to changes in supply and demand, as well as other potential changes that PJM and the other ISOs may propose over time, and 

&#8226; 

legislative and/or regulatory actions that permit subsidized local electric power generation. 

For additional information on the RPM and FCM markets, as well as on state subsidization through various mechanisms, see Regulatory Issues&#8212;Federal Regulation. 

Hedging Strategy 

To mitigate volatility in our results, we seek to contract in advance for a significant portion of our anticipated electric output, capacity and fuel needs. We seek to sell a portion of our anticipated lower-cost generation over a multi-year forward horizon, normally over a period of two to three years. We believe this hedging strategy increases stability of earnings. 

Among the ways in which we hedge our output are: (1) sales at PJM West and (2) BGS and similar full-requirements contracts. Sales at PJM West reflect block energy sales at the liquid PJM Western Hub and other transactions that seek to secure price certainty for our generation related products. The BGS-RSCP contract, a full-requirements contract that includes energy and capacity, ancillary and other services, is awarded for three-year periods through an auction process managed by the BPU. The volume of BGS contracts and the mix of electric utilities that our generation operations serve will vary from year to year. Pricing for the BGS contracts, including a capacity component, for recent and future periods by purchasing utility is as follows:

&#160; 

Although we enter into these hedges in an effort to provide price certainty for a large portion of our anticipated generation, there is variability in both our actual output as well as in the effectiveness of our hedges. Actual output will vary based upon total market demand, the relative cost position of our units compared to other units in the market and the operational flexibility of our units. Hedge volume can also vary, depending on the type of hedge into which we have entered. The BGS auction, for example, results in a contract that provides for the supplier to serve a percentage of the default load of a New Jersey EDC, that is, the load that remains after some customers have chosen to be served directly either by third party suppliers or through municipal aggregation. The amount of power supplied through the BGS auction varies based on the level of the EDC's default load, which is affected by the number of customers who are served by third party suppliers, as well as by other factors such as weather and the economy. 

In recent years, as market prices declined from previous levels, there was an incentive for more of the smaller commercial and industrial electric customers to switch to third party suppliers. In a falling price environment, this has a negative impact on our margins, as the anticipated BGS pricing is replaced by lower spot market pricing. As average BGS rates have declined to a level that more closely resembles current market prices, customers may see less of an incentive to switch to third party suppliers. We are unable to determine the degree to which this switching, or &#8220;migration,&#8221; will continue, but the impact on our results could be material should market prices fall or rise significantly. 

As of February 11, 2016 , we had contracted for the following percentages of our anticipated base load generation output for the next three years with modest amounts beyond 2018 .

In a changing market environment, this hedging strategy may cause our realized prices to differ materially from current market prices. In a rising price environment, this strategy normally results in lower margins than would have been the case had no hedging activity been conducted. Alternatively, in a falling price environment, this hedging strategy will tend to create margins higher than those implied by the then-current market. 

Our fuel strategy is to maintain certain levels of uranium in inventory and to make periodic purchases to support such levels. Our nuclear fuel commitments cover approximately 100% &#32;of our estimated uranium, enrichment and fabrication requirements through 2017 and a significant portion through 2020. We also have various long-term fuel purchase commitments for coal to support our fossil generation stations. These purchase obligations are consistent with our strategy in general to enter into contracts for our fuel supply in comparable volumes to our sales contracts. 

We take a more opportunistic approach in hedging both the fuel for and the anticipated output of our natural gas-fired generation. The generation from these units is less predictable, as a significant portion of these units will only dispatch when aggregate market demand has exceeded the supply provided by lower-cost units. Additionally, the recent development of low- 

cost gas supplies in the Marcellus region presents opportunities during certain portions of the year to procure gas for our generating units at attractive prices. 

Taking into account the hedging strategy, our expected capacity revenues from the capacity market mechanisms described above and certain ancillary service payments such as reactive power, more than half of Power&#8217;s gross margin in the upcoming year is relatively certain. 

Other 

Energy Holdings primarily owns and manages a portfolio of lease investments. Over the past several years, we have terminated all of our international leveraged leases in order to reduce the cash tax exposure related to these leases. We have also reduced our risk by opportunistically monetizing all of our previous international investments. 

The majority of Energy Holdings' remaining $784 million &#32;of domestic lease investments are primarily energy-related leveraged leases. As of December 31, 2015 , 73% &#32;of our total leveraged lease investments were rated as below investment grade by Standard &#38; Poor's. 

Energy Holdings' leveraged leasing portfolio is designed to provide a fixed rate of return. Leveraged lease investments involve three parties: an owner/lessor, a creditor and a lessee. In a typical leveraged lease financing, the lessor purchases an asset to be leased. The purchase price is typically financed 80% &#32;with debt provided by the creditor and the balance comes from equity funds provided by the lessor. The creditor provides long-term financing to the transaction secured by the property subject to the lease. Such long-term financing is non-recourse to the lessor and, with respect to our lease investments, is not presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

The lessor acquires economic and tax ownership of the asset and then leases it to the lessee for a period of time no greater than 80% &#32;of its remaining useful life. As the owner, the lessor is entitled to depreciate the asset under applicable federal and state tax guidelines. The lessor receives income from lease payments made by the lessee during the term of the lease and from tax benefits associated with interest and depreciation deductions with respect to the leased property. Our ability to realize these tax benefits is dependent on operating gains generated by our other operating subsidiaries and allocated pursuant to the consolidated tax sharing agreement between us and our operating subsidiaries. 

Lease rental payments are unconditional obligations of the lessee and are set at levels at least sufficient to service the non-recourse lease debt. The lessor is also entitled to any residual value associated with the leased asset at the end of the lease term. An evaluation of the after-tax cash flows to the lessor determines the return on the investment. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), the leveraged lease investment is recorded net of non-recourse debt and income is recognized as a constant return on the net unrecovered investment. 

For additional information on leases, including the credit, tax and accounting risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8212;Credit Risk, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212; Note 7. Financing Receivables . 

In accordance with a twelve year Amended and Restated Operations Services Agreement (OSA) entered into by PSEG LI and the LIPA, PSEG LI commenced operating LIPA&#8217;s electric T&#38;D system in Long Island, New York on January 1, 2014. As required by the OSA, PSEG LI also provides certain administrative support functions to LIPA. PSEG LI uses its brand in the Long Island T&#38;D service area. Pursuant to the OSA, PSEG LI acts as LIPA's agent in performing many of its obligations and in return (a) receives reimbursement for pass-through operating expenditures, (b) receives a fixed management fee and (c) is eligible to receive an incentive fee contingent on meeting established performance metrics. In addition, there is the opportunity for the parties to extend the contract for an additional eight years subject to the achievement by PSEG LI of certain performance levels during the initial term of the OSA. Also, as of January 2015, Power began providing fuel procurement and power management services to LIPA under separate agreements. 

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT 

PSE&#38;G 

Our transmission and distribution business is minimally impacted when customers choose alternate electric or gas suppliers since we earn our return by providing transmission and distribution service, not by supplying the commodity. Increased reliance by customers on net-metered generation, including solar, and changes in customer behaviors can result in decreased reliance on our system and impact our revenues and investment opportunities. The demand for electric energy and gas by customers is affected by customer conservation, economic conditions, weather and other factors not within our control. 

Changes in the current policies for building new transmission lines, such as those ordered by FERC and being implemented by PJM and other ISOs to eliminate contractual provisions that previously provided us a &#8220;right of first refusal&#8221; (ROFR) to 

construct projects in our service territory, could result in third party construction of transmission lines in our area in the future and also allow us to seek opportunities to build in other service territories. These implementing rules within the regions are still in flux so both the extent of the risk within our service territory and the opportunities for our transmission business elsewhere remain difficult to assess. For additional information, see the discussion in Regulatory Issues&#8212;Federal Regulation&#8212;Transmission Regulation, below. 

Construction of new local generation also has the potential to reduce the need for the construction of new transmission to transport remote generation and alleviate system constraints. 

Power 

Various market participants compete with us and one another in buying and selling in the wholesale energy markets, entering into bilateral contracts and selling to aggregated retail customers. Our competitors include: 

&#8226; 

merchant generators, 

&#8226; 

domestic and multi-national utility generators, 

&#8226; 

energy marketers, 

&#8226; 

banks, funds and other financial entities, 

&#8226; 

fuel supply companies, and 

&#8226; 

affiliates of other industrial companies. 

New additions of lower-cost or more efficient generation capacity could make our plants less economic in the future. Although it is not clear if this capacity will be built or, if so, what the economic impact will be, such additions would impact market prices and our competitiveness. 

Our business is also under competitive pressure due to demand side management (DSM) and other efficiency efforts aimed at changing the quantity and patterns of usage by consumers which could result in a reduction in load requirements. A reduction in load requirements can also be caused by economic cycles, weather, municipal aggregation and other customer migration and other factors. In addition, how resources such as demand response and capacity imports are permitted to bid into the capacity markets also affects the prices paid to generators such as Power in these markets. It is also possible that advances in technology, such as distributed generation and micro grids, will reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing electricity to a level that is competitive with that of most central station electric production. To the extent that additions to the electric transmission system relieve or reduce limitations and constraints in eastern PJM where most of our plants are located, our revenues could be adversely affected. Changes in the rules governing what types of transmission will be built, who is selected to build transmission and who will pay the costs of future transmission could also impact our revenues. 

Adverse changes in energy industry law, policies and regulation, including market structures and a potential shift away from competitive markets toward subsidized market mechanisms, would have the effect of artificially depressing prices in the competitive wholesale market and thus have the potential to harm competitive markets, on both a short-term and a long-term basis. At the same time, changes implemented in the PJM and New England capacity markets and other proposed market changes discussed more fully in Regulatory Issues&#8212;Federal Regulation provide the opportunity for additional compensation in both the energy and capacity markets. 

Environmental issues, such as restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and other pollutants, may also have a competitive impact on us to the extent that it becomes more expensive for some of our plants to remain compliant, thus affecting our ability to be a lower-cost provider compared to competitors without such restrictions. In addition, most of our plants, which are located in the Northeast where rules are more stringent, can be at an economic disadvantage compared to our competitors in certain Midwest states. If any new legislation or regulations were to require our competitors to meet the environmental standards currently imposed upon us, we would likely have an economic advantage since we have already installed significant pollution-control technology at most of our fossil-fueled stations. 

In addition, pressures from renewable resources could increase over time. For example, many parts of the country, including the mid-western region served by the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO), the PJM region and the California ISO, have either implemented or proposed implementing changes to their respective regional transmission planning processes that may enable the construction of large amounts of &#8220;public policy&#8221; transmission to move renewable generation to load centers. For additional information, see the discussion in Regulatory Issues&#8212;Federal Regulations&#8212;Transmission Regulation. 

EMPLOYEE RELATIONS 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 13,025 &#32;employees within our subsidiaries, including 8,111 &#32;covered under collective bargaining agreements. Two of our collective bargaining union agreements will expire in November 2016, five in April 2017, two in October 2017, and one in May 2018. We believe we maintain satisfactory relationships with our employees.

REGULATORY ISSUES 

Federal Regulation 

FERC 

FERC is an independent federal agency that regulates the transmission of electric energy and gas in interstate commerce and the sale of electric energy and gas at wholesale pursuant to the Federal Power Act (FPA) and the Natural Gas Act. PSE&#38;G and the generation and energy trading subsidiaries of Power are public utilities as defined by the FPA. FERC has extensive oversight over such public utilities. FERC approval is usually required when a public utility seeks to: sell or acquire an asset that is regulated by FERC (such as a transmission line or a generating station); collect costs from customers associated with a new transmission facility; charge a rate for wholesale sales under a contract or tariff; or engage in certain mergers and internal corporate reorganizations. 

FERC also regulates generating facilities known as qualifying facilities (QFs). QFs are cogeneration facilities that produce electricity and another form of useful thermal energy, or small power production facilities where the primary energy source is renewable, biomass, waste or geothermal resources. QFs must meet certain criteria established by FERC. We own various QFs through Power. QFs are subject to some, but not all, of the same FERC requirements as public utilities. 

FERC also regulates Regional Transmission Operators (RTOs)/ISOs, such as PJM, and their energy and capacity markets. 

For us, the major effects of FERC regulation fall into five general categories: 

&#8226; 

Regulation of Wholesale Sales&#8212;Generation/Market Issues/Market Power 

&#8226; 

Energy Clearing Prices 

&#8226; 

Capacity Market Issues 

&#8226; 

Transmission Regulation 

&#8226; 

Compliance 

Regulation of Wholesale Sales&#8212;Generation/Market Issues/Market Power 

Under FERC regulations, public utilities must receive FERC authorization to sell power in interstate commerce. They can sell power at cost-based rates or apply to FERC for authority to make market-based rate (MBR) sales. For a requesting company to receive MBR authority, FERC must first make a determination that the requesting company lacks market power in the relevant markets and/or that market power in the relevant markets is sufficiently mitigated. FERC requires that holders of MBR tariffs file an update every three years demonstrating that they continue to lack market power and/or that their market power has been sufficiently mitigated and report in the interim to FERC any material change in facts from those FERC relied on in granting MBR authority. 

PSE&#38;G, PSEG Energy Resources &#38; Trade LLC, PSEG Power Connecticut, PSEG Fossil LLC, PSEG Nuclear LLC and PSEG New Haven LLC all were granted MBR authority from FERC in October 2014. In order to retain its MBR authority, each of these entities will be required to submit its power uprate compliance filing to FERC by the end of December 2016. 

Energy Clearing Prices 

Energy clearing prices in the markets in which we operate are generally based on bids submitted by generating units. Under FERC-approved market rules, bids are subject to price caps and mitigation rules applicable to certain generation units. FERC rules also govern the overall design of these markets. At present, all units within a delivery zone receive a clearing price based on the bid of the marginal unit (i.e. the last unit that must be dispatched to serve the needs of load) which can vary by location. In addition, recent rule changes in the energy markets administered by PJM and ISO-NE (see Capacity Market Issues below) impose rigorous performance obligations and nonperformance penalties on resources during times of system stress. These FERC rules have a direct impact on the prices received by our units. 

FERC has also recently ordered certain favorable changes to energy market price formation rules improving shortage pricing and enhancing bidding flexibility for units. We continue to advocate in this context for additional changes in market rules that would provide more transparency about energy market prices. We cannot predict what action FERC might ultimately take, but such an examination could lead to future rule changes. 

Capacity Market Issues 

PJM, the NYISO and the ISO-NE each have capacity markets that have been approved by FERC. FERC regulates these markets and continues to examine whether the market design for each of these three capacity markets is working optimally. Issues presented in various forums include consideration of whether capacity market rules properly address and foster the development of state public policies, demand response (DR) and emerging technologies, whether generators are being sufficiently compensated in the capacity market and whether subsidized resources may be adversely affecting capacity market outcomes. We cannot predict what action, if any, FERC might take with regard to capacity market design. 

PJM &#8212;The RPM is the locational installed capacity market design for the PJM region, including a forward auction for installed capacity. Under the RPM, generators located in constrained areas within PJM are paid more for their capacity as an incentive to ensure adequate supply where generation capacity is most needed. The mechanics of the RPM in PJM continue to evolve and be refined in stakeholder proceedings and FERC proceedings in which we are active. 

During 2015, PJM implemented a new &#8220;Capacity Performance&#8221; (CP) mechanism that created a more robust capacity product definition with enhanced incentives for performance during emergency conditions and significant penalties for non-performance. However, aspects of FERC&#8217;s order are currently pending on rehearing before the FERC Commission and, ultimately, appeals of FERC&#8217;s rehearing order are likely. The CP mechanism was implemented for the 2015 base residual auction (covering the 2018-2019 Delivery Year) which concluded on August 21, 2015. The CP product will be implemented fully for the 2020-2021 Delivery Year. Based upon the August 2015 base residual auction results, the CP mechanism appears to have provided the opportunity for enhanced capacity market revenue streams for Power but future impacts cannot be assured. Further compliance with the CP mechanism may entail additional performance risks and require additional investments. 

In May 2014, in a case involving the proper level of compensation for DR resources in the energy markets, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals (D.C. Court) held that DR is not a FERC-jurisdictional product, thereby calling into question DR resources&#8217; ability to participate in either the energy or capacity markets in the future. In January 2015, FERC filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to review the D.C. Court's ruling. In January 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the D.C. Court&#8217;s ruling and determined that FERC has the authority to regulate wholesale DR and market operators&#8217; compensation of DR bids at full market value. This ruling removes any risk to DR&#8217;s participation in the energy and capacity markets. As a result, we expect activity to continue at the PJM stakeholder process regarding eligibility criteria for DR, including as a CP resource. 

In September 2014, PJM filed at FERC to re-set the Variable Resource Requirement (VRR) curve for the RPM. PJM expects to reset the VRR every four years. Establishment of the VRR curve is a critical component in determining how generators are paid in the capacity auction. In November 2014, FERC accepted PJM&#8217;s filing, which we believe represents an improvement over the status quo in terms of appropriately setting the demand curve. However, we and other generators have challenged FERC&#8217;s approval order on rehearing, taking exception to FERC&#8217;s approval of the manner in which PJM calculated the cost of capital and labor costs that form the basis for the Cost of New Entry component of the demand curve, which we believe have been set too low and do not accurately reflect the costs of building a new generating unit in PJM. Rehearing was denied in December 2015 and the PSEG Companies, and a trade association, have sought review of FERC&#8217;s order at the D.C. Court. 

An emerging issue in PJM involves the impact of subsidized generation on RPM market outcomes. This issue is most directly presented in connection with proposals pending before the Ohio Public Utility Commission whereby First Energy Corp. and American Electric Power are proposing to enter into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with their non-utility generation affiliates providing for above-market purchases from certain coal plants and a nuclear plant. The subsidies under these contracts would likely enable the affected generators to submit reduced bids into PJM capacity markets that are not reflective of their actual costs of operation and may prevent uneconomic generating facilities from retiring. Either of these conditions could artificially suppress capacity market prices, especially given that PJM&#8217;s currently effective &#8220;minimum offer price rule&#8221; (MOPR) would not apply to these plants as the MOPR only applies to new gas-fired units. 

We are unable to predict the results of these pending proceedings or any future related proceedings or to calculate the potential impacts on our business. 

MISO &#8212;MISO does not have a mandatory capacity market in place, as load serving entities may submit Fixed Resource Adequacy Plans in lieu of participating in the capacity auction. Significant quantities of capacity from MISO are imported into PJM which tends to have a downward effect on PJM capacity prices. However, recent enhancements to PJM market rules have tightened eligibility requirements for PJM imports and reduced these impacts. The issue of "capacity portability" from MISO continues to be examined in the stakeholder process. 

ISO-NE &#8212;ISO-NE&#8217;s market for installed capacity in New England provides fixed capacity payments for generators, imports and DR. The market design consists of a forward-looking auction for installed capacity that is intended to recognize the locational value of resources on the system and contains incentive mechanisms to encourage availability during stressed system conditions. ISO-NE also employs a mechanism, similar to PJM&#8217;s CP mechanism, that provides incentives for performance and that imposes penalties for non-performance during times of system stress. We view this mechanism as generally positive for generating resources as providing more robust income streams. However, it also imposes additional penalty risk for non-performance. One aspect of the current market design that we do not support is the exemption from the MOPR in the capacity market afforded for up to 200 MW annually (600 MW cumulatively) of renewable resources. We believe that the exemption is unduly discriminatory and will artificially suppress capacity prices. In March 2015, in conjunction with other companies, we filed a petition for review with the D.C. Court of FERC's ruling accepting the exemption. On December 1, 2015, following a request by FERC for a voluntary remand of the order, the D.C. Court remanded the case to FERC for additional consideration. Also in December 2015, ISO-NE filed a proposal that would allow resource owners to submit bids in the capacity auction reflecting their desire to retire a resource. However, this proposal also includes elements which we believe would have an unwarranted disruptive effect on efficient price formation in the capacity market. We have filed in opposition to this proposal. Finally, demand curves for ISO-NE capacity zones, including potential changes to the system-wide demand curves, are under consideration in an ISO-NE stakeholder process. These curves could have a significant impact upon the revenues our generation can expect to receive in the capacity market in New England. 

NYISO &#8212;NYISO operates a short-term capacity market that provides a forward price signal only for six months into the future. Various matters pending before FERC could affect the competitiveness of this market and the outcome of these proceedings could result in artificial price suppression unless sufficient market protections are adopted. 

One capacity market matter pending before FERC involves rules to govern payments and bidding requirements for generators proposing to exit the market but required to remain in service for reliability reasons. On March 19, 2015, FERC issued an order which held that units receiving special reliability payments could properly take those payments into account in formulating capacity market bids. We believe that this ruling could impact efficient price formation in the capacity market and could artificially suppress capacity market outcomes. On April 20, 2015, a trade association, Independent Power Producers of New York, Inc. (IPPNY) of which Power is a member filed for rehearing by FERC of this ruling. This rehearing is still pending. Also, in connection with this same proceeding, FERC required NYISO to submit a report addressing whether buyer-side mitigation measures are needed for new entry occurring in the &#8220;Rest of State&#8221; region and for uneconomic retention and repowering anywhere in the state. NYISO filed a report with FERC in December 2015 contending that these measures are not needed. The IPPNY has opposed NYISO&#8217;s contentions. In addition, on May 8, 2015, the New York Public Service Commission and other New York agencies filed a complaint at FERC requesting certain exemptions from the NYISO rules that prevent capacity suppliers from submitting bids that are not market competitive. On October 9, 2015, FERC granted in part, certain of the requested exemptions for renewable resources and for resources being used by the owner for self-supply. The IPPNY has sought rehearing of this order. This rehearing is still pending. 

Price Formation Initiatives 

Power has been actively involved both through stakeholder processes and through filings at FERC in seeking improvements to the rules for setting prices for energy in the day-ahead and real-time markets administered by PJM and other system operators. A recent development which is designed to increase market transparency involves a November 20, 2015 order in which FERC directed each RTO/ISO to publicly provide information related to certain price formation issues. If FERC&#8217;s initiative leads to reforms in the identified price formation issue areas, it could result in energy market prices that more accurately reflect prevailing system conditions and the costs of operating the marginal generating units. Specifically, each RTO/ISO was required to submit information regarding: (1) the ability of inflexible resources to set price; (2) how simultaneously occurring system outages are reflected in the market model; (3) the tools to anticipate near-term system conditions; (4) the allocation of costs associated with units dispatched for reliability out-of-merit; and (5) transparency. Each RTO/ISO was also directed to file a report that provides an update on its current practices in the identified topic areas, that provides the status of its efforts (if any) to address each of the five issues, and that fully responds to the questions contained in the FERC order by March 4, 2016. Following the submission of the RTOs&#8217;/ISOs&#8217; reports, FERC will allow for public comment. FERC will use the reports and comments to determine what further action is appropriate. 

Reactive Power Rates 

In June 2015, Power submitted a tariff filing with FERC to increase Power&#8217;s rates for reactive supply and voltage control service from approximately $27 million per year to about $39 million per year. The rates were last adjusted in 2008 and since that time various generating units have been de-activated, activated or improved with the net impact supportive of an upward rate adjustment. FERC accepted Power&#8217;s rate filing increase to become effective in January 2016, subject to refund, hearing and settlement procedures. FERC also referred the filing to the FERC Office of Enforcement for its evaluation. Power has participated in two settlement conferences to date with the FERC Trial Staff. Following settlement discussion with FERC Trial Staff, Power agreed to accept an overall rate of $34 million per year. Approval of this rate increase is currently pending before FERC. 

Long-Term Capacity Agreement Pilot Program Act (LCAPP) 

In 2011, the State of New Jersey enacted the LCAPP to subsidize approximately 2,000 MW of new natural gas-fired generation. The LCAPP provided that subsidies would be offered through long-term standard offer capacity agreements (SOCAs) between selected generators and the New Jersey EDCs. 

In 2013, the U.S. District Court in New Jersey found that the LCAPP was unconstitutional and declared the LCAPP null and void. This federal court decision was subsequently challenged on appeal in the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals (Third Circuit). The State of Maryland also took similar action to subsidize above-market new generation. This action was also determined to be unconstitutional in 2013 in the U.S. District Court in Maryland and such decision was challenged in the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals (Fourth Circuit). Both appeals were denied, with the Fourth Circuit denying the appeal regarding the State of Maryland&#8217;s action in June 2014 and the Third Circuit denying the LCAPP appeal in September 2014. These denials have been challenged on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. In October 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it would consider the appeal of the Fourth Circuit's decision involving Maryland. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear the case and is expected to issue a decision in 2016. We cannot predict the outcome of this appeal. 

Transmission Regulation 

FERC has exclusive jurisdiction to establish the rates and terms and conditions of service for interstate transmission. We currently have FERC-approved formula rates in effect to recover the costs of our transmission facilities. Under this formula, rates are put into effect in January of each year based upon our internal forecast of annual expenses and capital expenditures. Rates are subsequently trued up to reflect actual annual expenses and capital expenditures. Our allowed ROE is 11.68% &#32;for both existing and new transmission investments and we have received incentive rates, affording a higher ROE, for certain large scale transmission investments. 

Our 2016 Formula Rate Update with FERC for approximately $146 million &#32;in increased annual transmission revenues went into effect on January 1, 2016. Each year, transmission revenues are adjusted to reflect items such as updating estimates used in the filing with actual data. The adjustment for 2016 will include the impact of the extension of bonus depreciation, which was enacted after our 2016 filing was made, and is estimated to reduce our 2016 revenue increase as filed by approximately $27 million. For additional information about our transmission formula rate, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212; Note 5. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities . 

Transmission Policy Developments &#8212;FERC concluded in Order 1000 that the incumbent transmission owner should not always have a ROFR to construct and own transmission projects in its service territory. We and other companies appealed Order 1000 but this appeal was denied in 2014 by the D.C. Court. The current PJM rules retain carve-outs for projects that will continue to default to incumbents for construction responsibility, including immediately needed reliability projects, upgrades to existing transmission facilities, projects cost-allocated to a single transmission zone, and projects being built on existing rights-of-way and whose construction would interfere with incumbents&#8217; use of their rights-of-way. While these carve-outs ameliorate the impacts of the Order 1000 ruling, we and several other companies appealed various aspects of the FERC order approving PJM&#8217;s implementation of Order 1000 on the grounds that FERC had not met the requisite legal burden in eliminating the ROFR from the PJM Tariff. This appeal remains pending in federal court. 

In April 2013, PJM initiated its first "open window" solicitation process to allow both incumbents and non-incumbents the opportunity to submit transmission project proposals to address identified high voltage issues at Artificial Island in New Jersey. On July 29, 2015, the PJM Board approved the PJM staff's recommendation for a transmission project consisting of various components to be constructed by LS Power, PSE&#38;G and Potomac Holding Company. In August 2015, PJM sent PSE&#38;G a Construction Responsibility Letter (to which PSE&#38;G responded on November 9 and again on February 16, 2016) awarding PSE&#38;G three components of the project, estimated by PJM to cost approximately $126 million. PSE&#38;G has accepted construction responsibility, subject to reaching agreement with PJM on a reasonable cost estimate. Discussions are ongoing with PJM regarding the cost estimate for PSE&#38;G's portion of the work. On February 18, 2016, FERC issued an order granting PSE&#38;G&#8217;s request that it be permitted to seek recovery of 100% of its portion of the Artificial Island projects costs if the project 

is cancelled for reasons beyond PSE&#38;G&#8217;s control. PSE&#38;G continues to work with both PJM and its stakeholders to improve the rules governing open window processes in PJM. 

In a September 2015 order, FERC directed that a technical conference be held to address "concerns regarding how PJM plans for local transmission projects." Parties in the case raised concerns that too many projects are being approved outside of the Regional Transmission Expansion Plan (RTEP) mechanism to address &#8220;local&#8221; reliability requirements without going through the Order 1000 open window process. Intervenors also complained that there is inadequate transparency regarding the PJM transmission owners&#8217; consideration and selection of Supplemental Projects (which are not approved by the PJM Board). PSE&#38;G is participating in the process before FERC in support of the current PJM processes. In addition, certain PJM stakeholders have proposed an examination of the current planning rules, including changes with regard to criteria to be used for replacement of facilities that have reached their &#8220;end of life.&#8221; PSE&#38;G intends to actively participate in this process. However, we are unable to predict the outcome of these efforts. 

In a February 2016 order, FERC reversed a previous order and accepted a filing by the PJM transmission owners seeking authority to assign costs for RTEP projects (subject to PJM Board approval requirements) solely addressing localized needs to customers within the local transmission owner&#8217;s zone. FERC&#8217;s action in this order provides an exemption from the Order 1000 open window procedures for projects constructed by transmission owners to meet local transmission planning criteria. 

There are several matters pending before FERC that concern the allocation of costs associated with transmission projects being constructed by PSE&#38;G. In addition, in a separate proceeding, a merchant transmission operator has sought rehearing of the May 2014 order granting PSE&#38;G&#8217;s request for incentives related to the Bergen-Linden Corridor Project (BLC), solely with respect to the cost allocation for that project. That rehearing request remains pending. Regardless of how these proceedings are resolved, PSE&#38;G&#8217;s ability to recover the costs of these projects will not be affected. However, the result of these proceedings could ultimately impact the amount of costs borne by ratepayers in New Jersey and may cause increased scrutiny regarding PSE&#38;G's future capital investments. In addition, Power, as a BGS supplier, submits bids into the auction and obtains an obligation to provide services that include specified transmission costs. If the allocation of the costs associated with the transmission projects were to increase these transmission costs, BGS suppliers may be entitled to an adjustment. However, suppliers may not be able to recoup these adjustments immediately as they are subject to BPU approval. 

In one proceeding, Con Edison filed a complaint against PJM at FERC in November 2014 challenging PJM's allocation of costs for two PSE&#38;G projects in northern New Jersey, including the BLC. In June 2015, FERC issued an order dismissing the complaint. Con Edison and a merchant generator have sought judicial review of certain aspects of FERC&#8217;s order and Con Edison has filed a rehearing request with FERC. 

Another proceeding is a matter remanded from a federal appellate court concerning the appropriate cost allocation for certain 500 kV projects in PJM that either have been built or are in the process of being built, including the Susquehanna-Roseland project. This matter is currently in advanced settlement discussions at FERC. Under possible settlement outcomes under consideration, Power, as a BGS supplier could become obligated to pay amounts previously paid by other PJM transmission customers. However, Power does not believe that the anticipated level of any such potential payments would have a material effect on Power&#8217;s financial statements. 

In another complaint proceeding against PJM, in May 2015 and as amended in July 2015, a merchant transmission operator challenged PJM&#8217;s allocation of costs for four PSE&#38;G projects, including BLC. PSE&#38;G filed an opposition to the complaint and the matter is currently pending at FERC. In August 2015, the Delaware Public Service Commission and the Maryland Public Service Commission also filed a complaint against PJM and certain transmission owners that have voting rights over cost allocation and rate design, including PSE&#38;G, alleging that PJM tariff provisions allocate an excessive share of the Artificial Island project costs to them relative to the actual benefits of the project to residents of Delaware and Maryland. PSE&#38;G participated in a group filing of transmission owners that opposed the complaint. PJM also answered the Delaware/Maryland complaint but stated that the Artificial Island cost allocation appeared &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; and raised &#8220;equity concerns.&#8221; On January 12, 2016, we participated in a technical conference at FERC related to PJM cost allocation with the stated purpose of determining whether special allocation rules are needed for reliability projects based upon the reliability needs other than insufficient flow capability over the affected transmission facilities. We are unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings. 

In June 2015, a transmission developer filed a complaint against PJM claiming that PJM wrongfully refused to provide data and a transparent process for evaluating transmission network upgrade requests that the transmission developer had submitted to PJM. According to the complaint, PJM and certain transmission owners wrongfully inflated the scope and associated costs of mitigation work needed to accommodate the developer&#8217;s proposal in order to prevent it from pursuing its projects. Although not named as a respondent in the complaint, PSE&#38;G is identified as one of the companies claimed to have been involved. In July 2015, PJM filed a response, which included a supporting affidavit from PSE&#38;G, contesting the allegations. Settlement conferences in this matter are currently on-going. 

Transmission Rate Proceedings &#8212;Several complaints have been filed and several remain pending at FERC against transmission owners around the country, challenging those transmission owners&#8217; base ROEs. Certain of those complaints have 

resulted in decisions and others have been settled, resulting in reductions of those transmission owners' base ROEs. While we are not the subject of a challenge to the ROE employed in PSE&#38;G&#8217;s transmission formula rate, the results of these other proceedings could set precedents for other transmission owners with formula rates in place, including PSE&#38;G. 

Compliance 

FERC Audit &#8212;In November 2012, FERC commenced an audit of each of the PSEG companies that have MBR authority from FERC. The companies were audited by FERC for compliance with its rules for (i) receiving and retaining MBR authority, (ii) the filing of electric quarterly reports (EQRs), and (iii) our generating units' receipt of payments from the RTO/ISO when they are required to run for reliability reasons when it is not economical for them to do so. On October 16, 2014, FERC issued a final, public audit report that contained two findings and recommendations for enhanced review and reporting of our EQRs. In November 2014, we submitted a compliance plan to FERC explaining how we intend to implement FERC&#8217;s recommendations and we thereafter provided quarterly updates to FERC reporting on our progress in implementing the recommendations. At this time, we have satisfied all of FERC&#8217;s requirements. 

FERC &#8212;For information about the preliminary non-public investigation initiated by the FERC Staff regarding errors in the calculation of certain components of Power's cost-based bids for its New Jersey fossil generating units in the PJM energy market and the quantity of energy that Power offered into the energy market for its fossil peaking units compared to the amounts for which Power was compensated in the capacity market for those units, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. 

Reliability Standards&#8212; Congress has required FERC to put in place, through the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), national and regional reliability standards to ensure the reliability of the U.S. electric transmission and generation system (grid) and to prevent major system blackouts. There has been considerable focus recently on physical security in light of, among other things, a substation attack in California that occurred in 2013. As a result, FERC directed the NERC to draft a physical security standard intended to further protect assets deemed &#8220;critical&#8221; to reliability of the grid. In November 2014, FERC issued an order approving the NERC&#8217;s proposed physical security standard. Under the standard, utilities will be required to identify critical substations as well as develop threat assessment plans to be reviewed by independent third parties. In our case, the third party is PJM. As part of these plans, utilities could decide or be required to build additional redundancy into their systems. This standard will supplement the Critical Infrastructure Protection standards that are already in place and that establish physical and cybersecurity protections for critical systems. We are on schedule to meet all NERC requirements. 

Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) 

In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the SEC and the CFTC are in the process of implementing a new regulatory framework for swaps and security-based swaps. The legislation was enacted to reduce systemic risk, increase transparency and promote market integrity within the 

financial system by providing for the registration and comprehensive regulation of swap dealers and by imposing recordkeeping, data reporting, margin and clearing requirements with respect to swaps. To implement the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has engaged in a comprehensive rulemaking process and has issued a number of proposed and final rules addressing many of the key issues. We are currently subject to record keeping and data reporting requirements applicable to commercial end users. The CFTC has also proposed rules establishing position limits for trading in certain commodities, such as natural gas, and we are currently analyzing the potential impact of these rules on our business. 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) 

Our operation of nuclear generating facilities is subject to comprehensive regulation by the NRC, a federal agency established to regulate nuclear activities to ensure protection of public health and safety, as well as the security and protection of the environment. Such regulation involves testing, evaluation and modification of all aspects of plant operation in light of NRC safety and environmental requirements. Continuous demonstration to the NRC that plant operations meet requirements is also necessary. The NRC has the ultimate authority to determine whether any nuclear generating unit may operate. The current operating licenses of our nuclear facilities expire in the years shown in the following table:

As a result of events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility in Japan following the earthquake and tsunami in 2011, the NRC began performing additional operational and safety reviews of nuclear facilities in the United States. These reviews and the lessons learned from the events in Japan have resulted in additional regulation for the nuclear industry and could impact future operations and capital requirements for our facilities. We believe that our nuclear plants currently meet the stringent applicable design and safety specifications of the NRC. 

In 2011, a NRC task force submitted a report containing various recommendations to ensure plant protection, enhance accident mitigation, strengthen emergency preparedness and improve NRC program efficiency. The NRC staff also issued a document which provided for a prioritization of the task force recommendations. The NRC approved the staff's prioritization and implementation recommendations subject to a number of conditions. Among other things, the NRC advised the staff to give the highest priority to those activities that can achieve the greatest safety benefit and/or have the broadest applicability (Tier 1), to review filtration of boiling water reactor (BWR) primary containment vents and encouraged the staff to create requirements based on a performance-based system which allows for flexible approaches and the ability to address a diverse range of site-specific circumstances and conditions and strive to implement the requirements in 2016. 

The NRC issued letters and orders to licensees implementing the Tier 1 recommendations in March 2012. In March 2013, the NRC initiated a rulemaking process for improvements to venting systems at 31 U.S. BWRs with &#8220;Mark I&#8221; and &#8220;Mark II&#8221; containments (similar to those at Fukushima), which include our Hope Creek and Peach Bottom units. In June 2013, the NRC issued orders requiring Mark I and Mark II licensees to upgrade or replace their reliable hardened vents with containment venting systems designed and installed to remain functional during severe accident conditions. We are implementing the diverse and flexible strategies and spent fuel pool level indication modifications in accordance with the regulatory requirements at the Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom nuclear units. For our Hope Creek and Peach Bottom units, final installation of the required modifications is expected to occur during the planned refueling outages in 2016-2018. 

The NRC is currently developing the regulatory basis for drywell filtration strategies rulemaking. The NRC expects to complete its evaluation and vote on a final rule in 2017. The NRC continues to evaluate potential revisions to its requirements in connection with its operational and safety reviews of nuclear facilities in the United States as a result of the Fukushima Daiichi incident. 

We are unable to predict the final outcome of these reviews or the cost of any actions we would need to take to comply with any new regulations, including possible modifications to our Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom facilities, but such cost could be material. 

State Regulation 

Since our operations are primarily located within New Jersey, our principal state regulator is the BPU, which oversees electric and natural gas distribution companies in New Jersey. We are also subject to various other states&#8217; regulations due to our operations in those states. 

Our New Jersey utility operations are subject to comprehensive regulation by the BPU including, among other matters, regulation of retail electric and gas distribution rates and service, the issuance and sale of certain types of securities and compliance matters. PSE&#38;G's participation in solar, demand response and energy efficiency programs is also regulated by the BPU, as the terms and conditions of these programs are approved by the BPU. BPU regulation can also have a direct or indirect impact on our power generation business as it relates to energy supply agreements and energy policy in New Jersey. 

We must file electric and gas rate cases with the BPU in order to change our utility base distribution rates. Our last base rate case was settled in 2010. As a result of our Energy Strong order discussed below, we are required to file our next base rate case proceeding no later than November 1, 2017. In addition to base rates, we recover certain costs or earn on certain investments pursuant to mechanisms known as adjustment clauses. These clauses permit the flow-through of costs to, or the recovery of investments from, customers related to specific programs, outside the context of base rate case proceedings. Recovery of these costs or investments is subject to BPU approval for which we make periodic filings. Delays in the pass-through of costs or recovery of investments under these mechanisms could result in significant changes in cash flow. For additional information on our specific filings, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212; Note 5. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities . 

Energy Strong Program &#8212;In May 2014, the BPU issued an Order approving our Energy Strong program which provides for investment in our BPU jurisdictional electric and gas system to improve resiliency for the future. Under the settlement, PSE&#38;G will invest up to $1.2 billion &#32;over an initial five-year period. The Order provides for cost recovery at a 9.75% &#32;rate of ROE on the first $1.0 billion of the investment, plus associated Allowance for Funds Used Under Construction, and will occur for completed projects on a semi-annual (for electric investments) or annual (for gas investments) basis. We will seek recovery of the remaining investment in PSE&#38;G's next base rate case. See Business&#8212;PSE&#38;G&#8212;Distribution for additional information about Energy Strong. 

During 2015, the BPU approved two Energy Strong petitions which allow us to recover in base rates capitalized Energy Strong investment costs for projects placed in service through May 31, 2015. The BPU Orders provide for a total $24 million annual revenue increase. 

Gas System Modernization Program (GSMP) &#8212;In November 2015, the BPU issued an Order approving the settlement of our GSMP through which PSE&#38;G will invest $905 million over the next three years to modernize its gas system. The settlement enables the utility to replace up to 510 miles of gas mains and 38,000 service lines over a three-year period, with cost recovery at a 9.75% rate of return on equity on $650 million of the investment through an accelerated recovery mechanism. Under the settlement, PSE&#38;G will seek recovery of the remaining $255 million of investment in its next base rate case. We expect to file our first investment recovery petition in 2016. 

Connecticut Rate Filing &#8212;In June 2015, Power&#8217;s subsidiary, PSEG New Haven LLC, filed a mandatory annual rate case with the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) for recovery of its costs and investment in its Connecticut-based PSEG New Haven LCC peaking units. Power requested 2016 revenues of $21 million. On November 18, 2015, PURA issued a Final Decision to approve the entirety of Power&#8217;s request. The newly approved rates are effective as of January 1, 2016. 

Consolidated Tax Adjustments (CTA) &#8212;New Jersey is one of only a few states that make CTA in setting rates for regulated utilities. These adjustments to rate base are made &#32; during the rate setting process and &#32; are intended to allocate to utility customers a portion of the tax benefits realized from the filing of a consolidated federal tax return by the utility&#8217;s parent corporation. The BPU has been considering the appropriateness of the adjustment and the methodology and mechanics of the calculation for some time. On October 22, 2014, the BPU approved a proposal by its Staff that limits the tax benefit period to be considered in the calculation to five years, sets the rate base adjustment at 25% of any such tax benefit and eliminates from the process any tax benefits tied to transmission earnings. In accordance with this October action, this CTA policy will be applied only with respect to future rate cases. The adoption of these modifications by the BPU is not expected to have a material impact on PSE&#38;G&#8217;s current earnings nor in its next rate case filing. On November 5, 2014, the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel appealed the BPU's decision. All briefs have been filed and the appeal remains pending. 

New Jersey Energy Master Plan (EMP ) &#8212;New Jersey law requires that an EMP be developed every three years, the purpose of which is to ensure safe, secure and reasonably-priced energy supply, foster economic growth and development and protect the environment. While not having the force of law, the EMP provides an overview of energy policy in New Jersey and may provide both opportunities and challenges for PSEG. The most recent EMP was finalized in December 2011 and placed an emphasis on expanding in-state electricity resources, reducing energy costs, recognizing the impact of climate change and setting new targets for a renewable portfolio standard and goals for energy supplies from clean energy sources. An update to the December 2011 EMP was released on December 31, 2015 which continued to emphasize the policies set forth in the December 2011 EMP while also addressing certain issues that have emerged since that time, placing an emphasis on improved system resiliency, critical energy infrastructure, emergency preparedness and cybersecurity. 

Additional matters are discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212; Note 5. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities . 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations with regard to environmental matters including, but not limited to: 

&#8226; 

air pollution control, 

&#8226; 

climate change, 

&#8226; 

water pollution control, 

&#8226; 

hazardous substance liability, and 

&#8226; 

fuel and waste disposal. 

Changing environmental laws and regulations significantly impact the manner in which our operations are currently conducted and impose costs on us to reduce the health and environmental impacts of our operations. Such laws and regulations may also affect the timing, cost, location, design, construction and operation of new facilities. To the extent that environmental requirements are more stringent and compliance more costly in certain states where we operate compared to other states that are part of the same market, such rules may impact our ability to compete within that market. Due to evolving environmental regulations, it is difficult to project future costs of compliance and their impact on competition. Capital costs of complying with known pollution control requirements are included in our estimate of construction expenditures in Item 7. MD&#38;A&#8212;Capital Requirements. The costs of compliance associated with any new requirements that may be imposed by future regulations are not known, but may be material. 

For additional information related to environmental matters, including proceedings not discussed below, as well as anticipated expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment, hazardous substance liabilities and fuel and waste disposal costs, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212; Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities . 

Air Pollution Control 

Our facilities are subject to federal regulation under the Clean Air Act (CAA) which requires controls of emissions from sources of air pollution and imposes record keeping, reporting and permit requirements. Our facilities are also subject to requirements established under state and local air pollution laws. The CAA requires all major sources, such as our generation facilities, to obtain and keep current an operating permit. The costs of compliance associated with any new requirements that may be imposed and included in these permits in the future could be material and are not included in our estimates of capital expenditures. 

&#8226; 

Hazardous Air Pollutants Regulation &#8212;In February 2012 , the &#32; Environmental Protection Agency &#32; (EPA) published Mercury Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for both newly-built and existing electric generating sources under the National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) provisions of the CAA. The MATS established allowable levels for mercury as well as other hazardous air pollutants and went into effect in April 2015. On June 29, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court held that it was unreasonable for the EPA to refuse to consider the materiality of costs in determining whether to regulate hazardous air pollutants from power plants and remanded the matter back to the D.C. Court. On December 15, 2015, the D.C. Court remanded the MATS to the EPA without vacating the rule. On December 1, 2015, the EPA proposed a Supplemental Finding that considers the materiality of costs in determining whether to regulate hazardous air pollutants from power plants in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's June ruling. 

&#8226; 

Demand Response (DR) Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines (RICE) Litigation &#8212; I n March 2013, Power filed a petition at the EPA challenging the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for RICE issued in January 2013. Among other things, the NESHAP include two exemptions that allow owners and operators of stationery emergency RICE to operate their engines without the installation and operation of emission controls (1) as part of an emergency DR program for 100 hours per year (100 hour exemption) or (2) as part of a financial arrangement with another entity per specified restrictions in non-emergency situations for 50 hours per year (50 hour exemption). This waiver of NESHAP standards results in disparate treatment of different generation technology types. In its appeal, Power sought more stringent emission control standards for RICE to support more competitive markets, particularly the PJM capacity market. In August 2014, the EPA denied the March 2013 petition and in October 2014, Power appealed the EPA's denial to the D.C. Court. On May 1, 2015, the D.C. Court vacated the 100 hour exemption but thereafter granted a stay until May 1, 2016. On September 23, 2015, the D.C. Court granted the EPA's motion for voluntary remand of the 50 hour exemption provision to the EPA. While both provisions remain in place, the EPA will undergo proceedings to address the D.C. Court's orders. We believe that the impact of the D.C. Court's rulings would likely benefit Power's and its competitors' operations of their power generation peaking units. 

&#8226; 

&#32; Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) &#8212;On January 1, 2015, the final CSAPR became effective which limits power plant emissions of Sulfur Dioxide (SO 2 ) and annual and ozone season nitrogen oxide (NO ) &#32;in 28 &#32;states that contribute to the ability of downwind states to attain and/or maintain the 1997 and 2006 particulate matter and the 1997 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). On April 6, 2015, the EPA revoked the 1997 ozone NAAQS of 80 parts per billion (ppb) and began implementation of the more stringent 2008 ozone NAAQS of 75 ppb. On December 3, 2015, the EPA published the proposed CSAPR Updating Rule to address the 2008 ozone NAAQS. The proposal establishes more stringent annual ozone season (May 1 through September 30) caps beginning May 1, 2017. We do not anticipate any material impact on our earnings or financial condition due to the CSAPR. 

&#8226; 

Ozone Standard &#8212;In December 2014, the EPA proposed a rule to lower the ambient air quality standard for the level of ozone in the atmosphere from 75 ppb to a level in the range of 65-70 ppb. On October 1, 2015, the EPA finalized a standard of 70 ppb. To meet the new standard, the EPA and the states have to implement additional emission reduction strategies for NO and volatile organic compounds. Some portions of the Mid-Atlantic and New England states are not expected to be able to meet the new standard. Although the majority of our fossil generating units employ state-of-the-art NO emission controls, we cannot predict the outcome of this matter since new requirements of the EPA and the states are unknown at this time. Numerous parties have filed petitions for review with the D.C. Court to challenge the rule. 

Climate Change 

&#8226; 

CO 2 &#32;Regulation under the &#32; CAA &#8212;On October 23, 2015, the EPA published the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for new power plants. The NSPS establishes two emission standards for CO 2 &#32;for the following categories: (i) fossil fuel-fired utility boilers and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) units, and (ii) natural gas combustion turbines. Simple cycle combustion turbines are exempt from the rule. 

On October 23, 2015, the EPA published the Clean Power Plan (CPP), a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions regulation under the CAA for existing power plants. The regulation establishes state-specific emission rate targets based on implementation of the best system of emission reduction (BSER). The BSER consists of three components: (i) heat rate improvements at existing coal-fired power plants, (ii) increased use of existing natural gas combined cycle capacity, and (iii) operation of incremental zero-emitting generation (renewables and nuclear). States may choose these or other methodologies to achieve the necessary reductions of CO 2 &#32;emissions. 

Each state must submit a compliance plan to the EPA by September 6, 2016 or seek a two-year extension to September 6, 2018. States can comply using an emission rate-based plan (pounds CO 2 /MWh) or a mass-based plan (tons). Compliance with the final rule is effective January 1, 2022. 

The EPA, FERC and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced that they plan to meet at least quarterly to evaluate states' plans and identify reliability concerns so adjustments can be made before the final plans are submitted. The agencies are engaging various stakeholders, including the Regional Transmission Operators/Independent System Operators. The agencies will continue to meet after the states' plans are in effect to assess if revisions are required. 

On October 23, 2015, the EPA also published proposed federal implementation requirements for states that do not submit an EPA-approved compliance plan. Comments were due by January 21, 2016. 

Numerous states, including New Jersey, and several industry groups filed petitions for review with the D.C. Court to challenge the CPP. In addition, the petitioners sought a stay of the rule. On January 21, 2016, the D.C. Court declined to stay the CPP. However, on February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the rule pending further review of the case. 

The U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s decision to stay the implementation of the CPP will delay deadlines for submission of state requests for extensions and final plans. If the CPP is upheld, new deadlines will need to be established and the effective date of the compliance period may be impacted. 

&#8226; 

Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) &#8212;In response to concerns over global climate change, some states have developed initiatives to stimulate national climate legislation through CO 2 emission reductions in the electric power industry. Certain northeastern states (RGGI States), including New York and Connecticut where we have generation facilities, have &#32; state-specific rules in place to enable the RGGI regulatory mandate in each state to cap and reduce CO 2 &#32;emissions. 

These rules make allowances available through a regional auction whereby generators may acquire allowances that are each equal to one ton of CO 2 &#32;emissions. Generators are required to submit an allowance for each ton emitted over a three-year period. Allowances are available through the auction or through secondary markets. 

In February 2013, the RGGI States released an updated Model Rule that, among other things, reduced the amount of available regional CO 2 &#32;allowances beginning in 2014. Each RGGI State must implement the changes through state-specific regulations. We do not expect these changes, or any future changes, to the RGGI rules will have a material impact on us. 

On November 17, 2015 the RGGI States initiated a 2016 Program Review stakeholder process. The focus of the 2016 Program Review is the post-2020 caps on GHG emissions and the incorporation of the EPA's CPP requirements. 

New Jersey withdrew from RGGI beginning in 2012. As a result, our New Jersey facilities are no longer obligated to acquire CO 2 &#32;emission allowances. This action has been challenged by environmental groups in the New Jersey state court. In March 2014, the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court ruled that the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) improperly withdrew its regulation under which RGGI had been implemented. The Court gave the NJDEP 60 days to initiate a public process to either repeal or amend that regulation to provide that it is applicable only when New Jersey is a participant in a regional or other established greenhouse gas program. On August 3, 2015, the NJDEP published its formal repeal of the rules implementing RGGI in New Jersey. 

&#32;&#32;New Jersey also adopted the Global Warming Response Act in 2007, which calls for stabilizing its GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, followed by a further reduction of greenhouse emissions to 80% &#32;below 2006 levels by 2050. To reach this goal, the NJDEP, the BPU, other state agencies and stakeholders are required to evaluate methods to meet and exceed the emission reduction targets, taking into account their economic benefits and costs. 

Water Pollution Control 

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) prohibits the discharge of pollutants to U.S. waters from point sources, except pursuant to a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued by the EPA or by a state under a federally authorized state program. The FWPCA authorizes the imposition of technology-based and water quality-based effluent limits to regulate the discharge of pollutants into surface waters and ground waters. The EPA has delegated authority to a number of state agencies, including those in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, to administer the NPDES program through state action. We also have ownership interests in facilities in other jurisdictions that have their own laws and implement regulations to control discharges to their surface waters and ground waters that directly govern our facilities in those jurisdictions. 

&#8226; 

Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines &#8212;On September 30, 2015, the EPA issued a new Effluent Guidelines Limitation Rule for steam electric generating units. The rule establishes new best available technology economically achievable (BAT) standards for fly ash transport water, bottom ash transport water, flue gas desulfurization and flue gas mercury control wastewater. The EPA provides an implementation period for currently existing discharges of three years or up to eight years if a facility needs more time to implement equipment upgrades and provide supporting information to its permitting authority. In the intervening time period, existing discharge standards continue to apply. Power's Mercer and Bridgeport Harbor stations and the jointly-owned Keystone and Conemaugh stations, have bottom ash transport water discharges that are regulated under this rule. We are unable to predict if this rule will have a material impact on our future capital requirements, financial condition and results of operations. 

In addition to regulating the discharge of pollutants, the FWPCA regulates the intake of surface waters for cooling. The use of cooling water is a significant part of the generation of electricity at steam-electric generating stations. Section 316(b) of the FWPCA requires that cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impact. The impact of regulations under Section 316(b) can be significant, particularly at steam-electric generating stations which do not have closed cycle cooling and do not use cooling towers to recycle water for cooling purposes. The installation of cooling towers at an existing generating station can impose significant engineering challenges and significant costs, which can affect the economic viability of a particular plant. 

&#8226; 

Cooling Water Intake Structure Regulation &#8212;In May 2014, the EPA issued a final cooling water intake rule under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) that establishes new requirements for the regulation of cooling water intakes at existing power plants and industrial facilities with a design flow of more than two million gallons of water per day. 

The EPA has structured the rule so that each state Permitting Director will continue to consider renewal permits for existing power facilities on a case by case basis. In connection with the assessment of the BTA of each facility that seeks a permit renewal, the rule requires that facilities conduct a wide range of studies related to impingement mortality and entrainment and submit the results with their permit applications. In August 2014, the EPA established October 14, 2014 as the effective date for each state to implement the provisions of the rule going forward when considering the renewal of permits for existing facilities on a case by case basis. 

In September 2014, several environmental non-governmental groups and certain energy industry groups filed petitions for review of the rule and the case has been assigned to the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals (Second Circuit). Environmental organizations, including but not limited to the environmental petitioners in the Second Circuit, have also filed suit under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) challenging the Biological Opinion issued by U.S. Fish &#38; Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) on the 316(b) rule in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Parties to these cases filed motions seeking to consolidate this secondary action with the primary case residing with the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit has agreed to consolidate the case and to allow industry petitioners to amend their petition to include review of the Biological Opinion issued by the FWS and NMFS and to add both parties as Respondents. This means that the FWS and NMFS will be parties to the 316(b) litigation, and the ESA claims against them will not be proceeding in the U.S. District Court. Briefings before the court are scheduled to begin in 2016 but the schedule has not yet been established. 

We are assessing the potential impact of the rule on each of our affected facilities and are unable to predict the outcome of permitting decisions and the effect, if any, that they may have on our future capital requirements, financial condition or results of operations, although such impacts could be material. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212; Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities &#32;for additional information. 

On June 30, 2015, the NJDEP issued a draft New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) permit for Salem. The draft permit does not require installation of cooling towers and allows Salem to continue to operate utilizing the existing once-through cooling water system with certain required system modifications. The draft permit was subject to a public notice and comment period. We participated in the NJDEP&#8217;s August 5, 2015 public hearing and submitted comments on the draft permit on September 18, 2015. The NJDEP may make revisions before issuing the 

final permit which is expected in the first half of 2016. For additional information, see Item 8. Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. 

We are actively engaged with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CTDEEP) regarding renewal of the current permit for the cooling water intake structure at Bridgeport Harbor Station Unit 3 (BH3). To address compliance with the EPA&#8217;s CWA Section 316(b) final rule, the current proposal under consideration is that, if a final permit is issued, we would continue to operate BH3 without making the capital expenditures for modification to the existing intake structure and retire the BH3 within five years of the effective date of the final permit. Based on current discussions with the CTDEEP, if the proposal is accepted, a final permit could be issued in the summer of 2016 indicating a potential retirement date for BH3 by summer 2021, which is four years earlier than the current estimated useful life ending in 2025. If the permit is not issued and the conditions below are not met, we will seek to operate BH3 through the current estimated useful life. 

Separately, we have also negotiated a Community Environmental Benefit Agreement (CEBA) with the City of Bridgeport, Connecticut. That CEBA provides that we would retire BH3 early if all its precedent conditions occur, which include receipt of all final permits to build and operate a proposed new combined cycle generating facility on the same site that BH3 currently operates, which could occur in 2017. Absent those conditions being met, and the permit renewal referred to above not being issued, we will seek to operate BH3 through the current estimated useful life. In February 2016, the proposed generating facility was awarded a capacity obligation. Construction is expected to commence in 2017, with operations expected to begin in mid-2019. 

&#8226; 

Waters of the United States &#8212;In April 2014, the EPA Administrator and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) jointly published a proposed rule to clarify the definition of waters of the U.S. under the CWA programs in order to protect the streams and wetlands that form the foundation of the nation&#8217;s water resources. This definition will have broad application to all areas of compliance under the CWA, including permitted discharges and construction activities. The final rule was published on June 29, 2015 and we are reviewing it to determine the materiality of the impacts that might result from the final rule. Some states, including New Jersey, are subject to state requirements beyond those &#32; imposed under federal law. While we do not anticipate material impacts to projects in New Jersey, the new definition could impose requirements in other states and regions that could impact the development of renewables. 

Various states, industry coalitions and environmental organizations have initiated legal action related to the provisions of the final rule. On October 9, 2015, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay of the rule pending further court action. 

&#8226; 

Bridgeport Harbor National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Compliance &#8212;In April 2015, we determined that monitoring and reporting practices related to certain permitted wastewater discharges at our Bridgeport Harbor station may have violated conditions of the station's NPDES permit and applicable regulations and could subject us to fines and penalties. We have notified the CTDEEP of the issues and have taken actions to investigate and resolve the potential non-compliance. We cannot predict the impact of this matter. 

&#8226; 

Endangered Species Act &#8212;On June 16, 2015, the Sierra Club and another environmental group submitted to the NJDEP a sixty-day notice of intent to sue alleging the agency has caused violations of the Endangered Species Act by allowing our Mercer generation station to operate in a manner which has caused the mortality of certain species of sturgeon. Among other things, the notice requested the NJDEP to prioritize completion of a permit renewal action for Mercer which addresses the alleged Endangered Species Act violations. We cannot predict the outcome of this action. 

Hazardous Substance Liability 

The production and delivery of electricity and the distribution and manufacture of gas, results in various by-products and substances classified by federal and state regulations as hazardous. These regulations may impose liability for damages to the environment from hazardous substances, including obligations to conduct environmental remediation of discharged hazardous substances as well as monetary payments, regardless of the absence of fault and the absence of any prohibitions against the activity when it occurred, as compensation for injuries to natural resources. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Our historic operations and the operations of hundreds of other companies along the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers are alleged by federal and state agencies to have discharged substantial contamination into the Passaic River/Newark Bay Complex. The EPA is also evaluating the Hackensack River, a tributary to Newark Bay, for inclusion in the Superfund program. We no longer manufacture gas. For additional information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212; Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities . 

&#8226; 

Site Remediation &#8212;The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act (Spill Act) require the remediation of discharged hazardous substances and authorize the EPA, the NJDEP and private parties to commence lawsuits to compel clean- 

ups or reimbursement for such remediation. The clean-ups can be more complicated and costly when the hazardous substances are in a body of water. 

&#8226; 

Natural Resource Damages &#8212;CERCLA and the Spill Act authorize the assessment of damages against persons who have discharged a hazardous substance, causing an injury to natural resources. Pursuant to the Spill Act, the NJDEP requires persons conducting remediation to characterize injuries to natural resources and to address those injuries through restoration or damages. The NJDEP adopted regulations concerning site investigation and remediation that require an ecological evaluation of potential damages to natural resources in connection with an environmental investigation of contaminated sites. The NJDEP also issued guidance to assist parties in calculating their natural resource damage liability for settlement purposes, but has stated that those calculations are applicable only for those parties that volunteer to settle a claim for natural resource damages before a claim is asserted by the NJDEP. We are currently unable to assess the magnitude of the potential financial impact of this regulatory change, although such impacts could be material. 

Fuel and Waste Disposal 

&#8226; 

Nuclear Fuel Disposal &#8212;The federal government has entered into contracts with the operators of nuclear power plants for transportation and ultimate disposal of spent nuclear fuel. To pay for this service, nuclear plant owners are required to contribute to a Nuclear Waste Fund. In accordance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, in 2009 the DOE conducted its annual review of the adequacy of the Nuclear Waste Fee and concluded that the current fee of 1/10 cent per kWh was adequate to recover program costs. In 2011, we joined the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) and fifteen other nuclear plant operators in a lawsuit in federal court seeking suspension of the Nuclear Waste Fee. In June 2012, the court ruled that the DOE failed to justify continued payments by electricity consumers into the Nuclear Waste Fund and ordered the DOE to conduct a complete reassessment of this fee. Spent nuclear fuel generated in any reactor can be stored in reactor facility storage pools or in Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations located at reactors or away from reactor sites. Since May 2014, the DOE reduced the nuclear waste fee to zero. Prior to the elimination of this fee, the annualized pre-tax cost was approximately $30 million . 

We have on-site storage facilities that are expected to satisfy the storage needs of Salem 1, Salem 2, Hope Creek, Peach Bottom 2 and Peach Bottom 3 through the end of their operating licenses. 

&#8226; 

Low Level Radioactive Waste &#8212;As a by-product of their operations, nuclear generation units produce low level radioactive waste. Such waste includes paper, plastics, protective clothing, water purification materials and other materials. These waste materials are accumulated on site and disposed of at licensed permanent disposal facilities. New Jersey, Connecticut and South Carolina have formed the Atlantic Compact, which gives New Jersey nuclear generators continued access to the Barnwell waste disposal facility which is owned by South Carolina. We believe that the Atlantic Compact will provide for adequate low level radioactive waste disposal for Salem and Hope Creek through the end of their current licenses including full decommissioning, although no assurances can be given. Low Level Radioactive Waste is periodically being shipped to the Barnwell site from Salem and Hope Creek. Additionally, there are on-site storage facilities for Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom, which we believe have the capacity for at least five years of temporary storage for each facility. 

&#8226; 

Coal Combustion Residuals (CCRs) &#8212;On December 19, 2014, the EPA issued a final rule which regulates CCRs as non-hazardous and requires that facility owners implement a series of actions to close or upgrade existing CCR surface impoundments and/or landfills. It also establishes new provisions for the construction of new surface impoundments and landfills. Our Hudson and Mercer generating stations, along with our co-owned Keystone and Conemaugh stations, are subject to the provisions of this rule. On April 17, 2015, the final rule was published with an effective date of October 19, 2015. The impact of this final rule was not material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. See Item 8. Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for additional information.
