BACKGROUND

Native AFGP Compound

AFGP (Anti-Freeze Glycoprotein) is found in nature as a compound produced by some fish, insects, reptiles, bacteria and plants that enable survival in freezing temperatures.

One of the many accomplishments from pioneering research of the U.S. Antarctic Program was the discovery, in the early sixties, that fish living year-long in subzero temperature are extremely resistant to freezing. The substances that prevent these fish from freezing were isolated, characterized and designated as AFGP. Various kinds of AFGP were isolated from many species of fishes, and in some amphibians, plants and insects. All of the AFGPs share a common characteristic that prevents ice crystals from growing and connecting to each other. Research has also confirmed a cell membrane stabilizing characteristic of native AFGP.

There has been much scientific research done in an attempt to synthetically replicate AFGPs in research institutions because the protective properties of AFGPs could have commercial applications, primarily in food and crop preservation at freezing temperatures. The native antifreeze glycoproteins are very large molecules that are often made up of a repeating series of smaller molecules, glycoproteins. Glycoproteins are often very biologically active, but they are inherently unstable. The oxygen-glycosidic link is readily cleaved by glycosidases, resulting in a low bio-availability of these glycoconjugate based molecules.

Scientific research prior to AAGP&#8482; has focused on building a stable and more efficient compound with a strong bond.

AAGP&#8482; &#8211; The Core Technology of ProtoKinetix

AAGP&#8482; Invention 

Dr. Geraldine Castelot-Deliencourt, along with Dr. Jean-Charles Quirion at the Research Institute of Organic Chemistry in Rouen, France, developed a patented process to stabilize the oxygen-glycosidic bond in these sugar based molecules. This patented process replaces the weaker oxygen bond with a C-F 2 mimetic. The resultant molecules are biologically active and stable over a pH range of 2 to 13. They are not broken down by glycosidases.

AAGP&#8482; Toxicity Tests 

Tests have shown that cells exposed to AAGP&#8482; at low and high concentrations have remained viable. A common viability test used on cell cultures using trypan blue dye exclusion method has been used to show AAGP&#8482; non-toxicity.

AAGP&#8482; Stability Tests 

AAGP&#8482; molecules have remained stable when subjected to three tests:

1. pH ranging from a strong acid level of 1.8 (stronger than stomach acid) to a strong alkali level of 13.8. (the pH scale is calibrated from 1, highly acidic, to 14, highly alkali); 

2. Enzymatic action using protease, which targets the amino acid bonds, and glycosidase, which targets the amino acid bonds, and glycosidase, which targets the sugar molecules; and 

3. Temperatures ranging from -196&#176;C (cryopreservation) to +37&#176;C (body temperature). 

Stress Tests on 12 Different Cell Lines 

Cell lines are selected for their high level of sensitivity. Cell lines are also selected for their potential role in adding value in medical applications, enhancing health and extending life. All tests are designed to explore how cells from different cell lines act biologically in the presence of AAGP&#8482; when subjected to health and life threatening inflammatory stress conditions and agents.

Bio-Screening Control Lab Testing 

For the last three years, AAGP&#8482; testing has been conducted pursuant to a comprehensive transplantation testing program in conjunction with the University of Alberta transplant research team. The Company entered into a consulting agreement in May 2015 with Dr. James Shapiro to collaborate with the James Shapiro Laboratory at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Dr. Shapiro directs the largest clinical islet transplantation program in the world. Dr. Shapiro and his team have conducted extensive testing with our AAGP&#8482; molecule using human islet cells in transplantation, investigating its effect on engraftment, insulin production, protective effect against anti-rejection drugs and investigation of the mechanism of action. The results provided consistent encouragement to continue testing to develop protocols that can be applied to transplantation medicine.

Allogeneic transplantation is the transplanting of cells, tissues or organs from the same species, but from a donor different than the recipient. Serious issues that have to be addressed are the engraftment of the transplanted organ or cells and the subsequent protection against the immune rejection of the foreign organ or cells. The protection, in the form of anti-rejection drugs, is toxic and causes damage to the graft. AAGP&#8482; has been shown in these trials to increase engraftment and reduce the toxicity damage.

&#160;

ProtoKinetix is currently preparing to start Phase I and Phase II human clinical trials at the University of Alberta with Dr. Shapiro in what is known as the Edmonton Protocol. In the Edmonton Protocol, pancreatic islet cells are placed in the liver of the patient to cure Type I Diabetes. Preliminary research has shown that if the islet cells are first treated with our AAGP&#8482; molecule the islet cells chances of survival is greatly increased. If Phase I and Phase II human clinical trials are successful, the AAGP&#8482; will be a permanent addition to the Edmonton Protocol.

Dr. Shapiro and his team are developing further testing based on three primary activities:

1. The ongoing testing and refinement of cellular transplantation using human islet cells as the demonstrated model . In particular, AAGP&#8482; may provide powerful protection against hostile agents that severely inhibit engraftment success. Cell therapies are currently being developed in the industry around the world for the treatment of spinal cord injury, damaged heart tissue, stroke, diabetes as well as many other conditions. 

2. Human organ preservation . The program will assess the effect of AAGP&#8482; in extending the transplant viability of donor organs. The Canadian National Transplant Research Program is a major national initiative involving the Federal Institutes of Health, all Provinces and the private sector (see http://www.cntrp.ca/ ). The first testing will be conducted on livers to determine whether AAGP&#8482; can extend the ex-vivo functionality of the organ. 

3. Auto immune disease . This class of diseases occur where the body&#8217;s immune system starts to attack healthy cells and organs. Diseases in this category include, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and Type 1 diabetes. Using the Non Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice as a model, the Edmonton team will be specifically assessing the potentially protective effect of AAGP&#8482; against the immune system attacks against the islet cells in the pancreas. 

The Company is also presently preparing a clinical trial application to Health Canada. This trial will be conducted by Dr. Shapiro and his team at the University of Alberta on the well-established, Edmonton Protocol used for treatment of Type 1 Diabetes through islet cell transplants. As part of the submission, ProtoKinetix has:

&#183; Commissioned AmbioPharm, Inc. to produce AAGP&#8482; under strict GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) standards. GMP is required by Health Canada and US FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration) for human use; 

&#183; Contracted with a third party for toxicity testing; and 

&#183; Contracted with BRI Labs in Vancouver to address BRPharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD). PK/PD studies the absorption rate and quantities of drugs through the human body. 

AAGP&#8482; Commercial Applications

The extent of the value of the ProtoKinetix family of AAGPs&#8482; is subject to investigation by commercial entities specializing in regenerative medicine, cellular and tissue therapies, organ transplantation, trauma, blood product banking, and anti-inflammation. The Company is targeting these entities in furtherance of product development.

&#160;

&#160;

Health Care 

Acute medical problems are increasingly reliant on, and benefit from, solutions that can deal with the fundamental factors of inflammation and oxidation. Both are well-known causes of life-threatening conditions and diseases, and accelerated aging. In addition many acute medical problems are benefiting from cell therapies and transplantation of cells, tissues and time sensitive organs.

Health Care Applications of AAGP&#8482; fall into two main categories: (i) harvesting, storage and transplanting cells, tissues and organs; and (ii) treatments for conditions and diseases caused by stress factors, including UV radiation, oxidation and inflammation. These are all areas that expand into many sub-categories of existing and future health care solutions.

AAGP&#8482; continues to receive exposure in the industry; it was presented at the Congress of the International Pancreas and Islet Transplant Association in Melbourne, Australia in November, 2015. Currently, researchers from the University of Alberta&#8217;s Faculty have completed a peer review and have been published in the prestigious, American Diabetes Association&#8217;s Journal: Diabetes.

Intellectual Property

On March 4, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with Intrepid Innovations Corporation (&#8220;Intrepid&#8221;) to sell the exclusive rights for the application of the AAGP&#8482; molecule. The total purchase price for the exclusive rights to the application was $2,500,000 and was to be paid as follows:

&#183; $25,000 cash deposit (received); 

&#183; $25,000 paid by cash on or before April 22, 2014 as a balance of the transaction deposit (received); 

&#183; Six monthly payments of $25,000 on or before May 22, June 22, July 22, August 22, September 22 and October 22, 2014 ($5,000 received); and 

&#183; $2,300,000 paid by the issuance of 3,500,000 restricted shares of the buyer as payment of the outstanding balance. These shares can be redeemed by a cash payment at any time within the first 6 months of the effective date of this agreement. 

Once the Company had received $2,500,000 in total through payment, sale of the shares and through the redemption of the shares, any surplus shares would have been returned to Intrepid. In the event that the total payment had not totaled $2,500,000, Intrepid would pay the difference to the Company no later than 13 months after the effective date of the agreement.

The agreement was terminated on October 27, 2014 due to non-payment of the agreed to amounts. The amounts advanced were non-refundable in accordance with the agreement and as at December 31, 2014, the Company recognized a gain on deposit on sale in the amount of $55,000 to the statement of operations.

Patents

On or about January 5, 2015, the Company entered into an Assignment of Patents and Patent Application (the &#8220;Patent Assignment&#8221;) between the Company and Institut National des Sciences Appliqu&#233;es de Rouen (&#8220;INSA&#8221;) for the assignment of certain patents and all rights associated therewith (the &#8220;Patents&#8221;). The Company and INSA had previously entered into a licensing agreement for the Patents in August 2004. The Patent Assignment transferred all of the Patents and rights associated therewith to the Company upon payment to INSA of the sum of 25,000 Euros.

Through this assignment, ProtoKinetix is now the sole owner of all issued patents of the &#8220;Gem difluorinated C-glycopeptides, their preparation and their use for the preservation of biological materials and/or in cryosurgery&#8221; family, and all the rights associated therewith. Importantly, this family includes issued patents in Canada (Patent No. CA2,558,801), England, France, and Germany (Patent No. EP1,817,329) and the United States (Patent No. US8,394,362).

&#160;

&#160;

On or about April 8, 2015, ProtoKinetix entered into a Royalty Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) between the Company and the Governors of the University of Alberta (&#8220;UAB&#8221;) for the assignment of UAB&#8217;s portion of certain patents and all rights associated therewith (the &#8220;Patent Rights&#8221;). The Agreement also grants UAB a royalty of 5% of the gross revenue from the assignment, manufacturing, sale, distribution, or licensing of the Patent Rights and any commercial products generated from the Patent Rights. The Company has the irrevocable option to purchase the royalty for CAN $5,000,000 (approximately US $4,000,000) for two years from the earlier of September 1, 2015 or the first date UAB publishes its research related to the Patent Rights. UAB has yet to publish its research related to the Patent Rights.

Through this assignment, the Company has gained UAB&#8217;s portion of US provisional patent application no. 62/007,626, and International Patent Application no. PCT/CA2015/050509, as well as U.S. Patent Application no. US 14/728,535 which both claim priority from said provisional patent application related to the use of anti-aging glycopeptides to enhance beta cell health, survival and improve transplant outcomes, and all patents issuing from and claiming priority to these applications.

On or about April 22, 2015, ProtoKinetix entered into a Technology Transfer Agreement with Grant Young for the assignment of Mr. Young&#8217;s portion of certain patent applications and all rights associated therewith (the &#8220;Young Patent Application Rights&#8221;). In exchange for the Young Patent Application Rights, Mr. Young was paid $10,000 in cash and a five-year warrant to purchase 6,000,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock at an exercise price of $0.10 per share.

Through this assignment, the Company has gained Mr. Young&#8217;s portion of US provisional patent application no. 62/007,626 and applications claiming priority therefrom, related to the use of anti-aging glycopeptides to enhance beta cell health, survival and improve transplant outcomes, and all patents issuing from and claiming priority to such application.

The Patents from INSA and Patent Rights from UAB and Mr. Young secure, amongst other things, key intellectual property rights to the Company&#8217;s use of the AAGP&#8482; lead compound in regenerative medicine.

Consistent with our agreements with the licensors of various technologies we license, we have no finished commercial product or products, and have received no FDA approvals for any product or diagnostic procedures. We are focused on the research and development of one lead compound known as AAGP&#8482;. We filed a trademark application with the United States Patent &#38; Trademark Office on September 15, 2005 with a registration date of August 7, 2007. The application was subsequently cancelled on March 14, 2014 because we did not file a renewal declaration. We are in the process of filing a new application for registration of the mark.

Subject to our available financial resources, our intellectual property strategy is to continue testing of the AAGP&#8482; lead compound and develop marketable applications of the compound.

Trade Secrets and Know-How

The Company has developed a substantial body of trade secrets and know-how relating to the development, use and manufacture of AAGP&#8482;, including but not limited to the optimization of materials for efforts, and how to maximize sensitivity, speed-to-result, specificity, stability, purity and reproducibility.

Competition

The markets that the Company is focusing on are multi-billion dollar international industries which are intensely competitive. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial, research, manufacturing, and marketing resources.

Industry competition in general is based on the following:

&#167; Scientific and technological capability; 

&#167; Proprietary know-how; 

&#167; The ability to develop and market products and processes; 

&#167; The ability to obtain FDA or other required regulatory approvals; 

&#167; The ability to manufacture products that meet applicable FDA requirements, (i.e. FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulations) see also Governmental Regulation section; 

&#167; Access to adequate capital; 

&#167; The ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and 

&#167; The availability of patent protection. 

&#160;

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s ability to develop its research is in large measure dependent on having sufficient and additional resources and/or collaborative relationships.

The Company&#8217;s access to capital is more challenging, relative to most of its competitors. This is a competitive disadvantage. The Company believes however that its access to capital may increase as it gets closer to the development of a commercially viable product.

The Company believes that its research has enabled it to attract and retain qualified consultants. Because of the greater financial resources of many of its competitors, the Company may not be able to complete effectively for the same individuals to the extent that a competitor uses its substantial resources to attract any such individuals.

Governmental Regulation

The Company&#8217;s AAGPs&#8482; have commercial applications in markets and circumstances that fall under government regulations ranging from none to limited to extensive.

Although there is no such immediate need to make any regulatory filing in the United States, the Company has limited or no experience with regard to obtaining FDA or other required regulatory approvals. In February 2015 the Company appointed Dr. Julia Levy to its Business and Scientific Advisory Board and intends to retain the services of additional appropriately experienced consultants. For this reason, should our research efforts continue to show promise, we will need to hire consultants to assist the Company with such governmental regulations.

As the Company continues to conduct research and testing programs, in collaboration with commercial entities, to expand and confirm the potential medical applications of AAGP&#8482; in a number of fields, including regenerative medicine, cell therapy, blood products, and transplants, the Company intends to utilize the regulatory expertise of others, whether they are consultants or commercial entities involved on collaborative development programs with the Company.

The following discussion relates to factors that may come into play when and if the Company has a commercially viable product in an area which requires regulatory approval. These products may be regulated by the European regulatory agencies, FDA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, certain state and local agencies, and/or comparable regulatory bodies in other countries (collectively, these agencies shall be referred to as the &#8220;Agencies&#8221;). Government regulation affects almost all aspects of development, production, and marketing, including product testing, authorizations to market, labeling, promotion, manufacturing, and record keeping. The products regulated by FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture require some form of action by such agency before they can be marketed in the United States, and, after approval or clearance, the products must continue to comply with other FDA requirements applicable to marketed products. Both before and after approval or clearance, failure to comply with the FDA&#8217;s requirements can lead to significant penalties. The Company&#8217;s proposed AAGP&#8482; products will require government regulatory approval as a biologic agent. Such regulatory approval will be granted only after the appropriate preclinical and clinical studies are conducted to confirm efficacy and safety.

Every company that manufactures biologic products or medical devices distributed in the United States must comply with the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulations. These regulations govern the manufacturing process, including design, manufacture, testing, release, packaging, distribution, documentation, and purchasing. Compliance with the Quality System Regulations is required before the FDA will approve an application. These requirements also apply to marketed products. Companies are also subject to other post-market and general requirements, including compliance with restrictions imposed on marketed products, compliance with promotional standards, record keeping, and reporting of certain adverse reactions or events. The FDA regularly inspects companies to determine compliance with the Quality System Regulations and other post-approval requirements. Failure to comply with statutory requirements and the FDA&#8217;s regulations can lead to substantial penalties, including monetary penalties, injunctions, product recalls, seizure of products, and criminal prosecution.

The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988 prohibits laboratories from performing in vitro tests for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of any disease or impairment of, or the assessment of, the health of human beings unless there is in effect for such laboratories a certificate issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services applicable to the category of examination or procedure performed. Although a certificate is not required for ProtoKinetix, the Company considers the applicability of the requirements of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act in the potential design and development of its products.

The Company is also subject to regulations in foreign countries governing products, human clinical trials and marketing, and may need to obtain approval or evaluations by international public health agencies, such as the World Health Organization, in order to sell products in certain countries. Approval processes vary from country to country, and the length of time required for approval or to obtain other clearances may in some cases be longer than that required for U.S. governmental approvals. The extent of potentially adverse governmental regulation affecting ProtoKinetix that might arise from future legislative or administrative action cannot be predicted.

Research and Development

Our business depends on our ability to sponsor research and development activities. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company incurred total research and development expenses of $13,750. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred total research and development expenses of $158,890. In order to reach the Company&#8217;s goals of developing a marketable product, we will need to increase the funding of our research and development activities which at this time is limited by our ability to raise money to fund the Company.

Environmental Laws

To date, the Company has not encountered any costs relating to compliance with any environmental laws.

Employees

To date, the Company does not have any employees. The Company&#8217;s President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer are both engaged as consultants to the Company.
