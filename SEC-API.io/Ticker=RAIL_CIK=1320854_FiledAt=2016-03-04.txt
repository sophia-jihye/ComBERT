 Item 1. Business. OVERVIEW 

We are a diversified manufacturer of railcars and railcar components. We design and manufacture a broad variety of railcar types for transportation of bulk commodities and containerized freight products primarily in North America, including open top hoppers, covered hoppers, and gondolas along with intermodal and non-intermodal flat cars. We and our predecessors have been manufacturing railcars since 1901. Over the last several years, we have introduced a number of new or redesigned railcar types. We believe we are the leading manufacturer of aluminum-bodied railcars including coal cars in North America, based on the number of railcars delivered. 

Our railcar manufacturing facilities are located in Cherokee, Alabama (&#147;Shoals&#148;), Danville, Illinois and Roanoke, Virginia. Our Shoals facility is an important part of our long-term growth strategy as we continue to expand our railcar product and service offerings outside of our traditional coal car market. While our Danville and Roanoke facilities will continue to support our coal car products, we believe the Shoals facility will allow us to produce a broader variety of railcars in a cost-effective and efficient manner. Our Shoals facility delivered its first railcars during the fourth quarter of 2013 and production continued to ramp up during 2014 and 2015. Our Danville facility resumed production in June 2014 after being idled for 14 months. Given the challenged coal market and the completion of our recent rebuild program, operations at our Danville facility will be significantly curtailed in 2016. 

We also lease freight cars through our JAIX Leasing Company subsidiary. We offer railcar leasing and refurbishment alternatives to our customers, an approach designed to enhance our position as a full service provider to the railcar industry. Although we continually look for opportunities to package our leased assets for sale to our leasing company partners, these leased assets may not be converted to sales, and may remain revenue producing assets into the foreseeable future. 

We also refurbish and rebuild railcars and sell forged, cast and fabricated parts for all of the railcars we produce, as well as those manufactured by others. Through September 30, 2015, FreightCar Rail Services, LLC (&#147;FCRS&#148;) provided railcar repair and maintenance and inspections for all types of freight railcars. FCRS had repair and maintenance and inspection facilities in Grand Island, Nebraska and Hastings, Nebraska and serviced freight cars and unit coal trains utilizing key rail corridors in the Midwest and Western regions of the United States. On September 30, 2015, the Company sold its railcar repair and maintenance services business. The sale allows the Company to increase its focus on its railcar manufacturing, parts and leasing business as the Company continues to broaden its product portfolio through the introduction of new railcar types and implements operational improvements, enhancing productivity through training, technology and automation. During the fourth quarter of 2013 we decided to close our underperforming maintenance and repair shop in Clinton, Indiana and during the third quarter of 2014, those repair shop assets were sold to a strategic buyer. 

Our primary customers are railroads, shippers and financial institutions, which represented 69%, 17% and 15%, respectively, of our total sales attributable to each type of customer for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we delivered 8,980 railcars, including 3,395 coal cars, which compared to 7,102 railcars, including 4,038 coal cars, delivered in the year ended December 31, 2014. Our deliveries for the year ended December 31, 2015 included 2,600 rebuilt railcars compared to 3,090 rebuilt railcars delivered in 2014. Our total backlog of firm orders for railcars decreased from 14,791 railcars as of December 31, 2014 to 9,840 railcars as of December 31, 2015. Our backlog as of December 31, 2015 includes a variety of railcar types almost all of which were orders for non-coal cars. The estimated sales value of our backlog is $926 million as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2014, 77% of our backlog consisted of orders for non-coal cars. Our backlog as of December 31, 2015 included no rebuilt railcars compared to 2,600 rebuilt railcars in our backlog as of December 31, 2014.

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 

We design and manufacture a broad variety of freight cars including covered hoppers, open top hoppers, gondolas, intermodal and non-intermodal flat cars that transport numerous types of dry bulk and containerized freight products. 

In the last five years, we have added 31 new or redesigned products to our portfolio, including various covered hopper car products with cubic capacities from 3,282 cubic foot to 6,250 cubic foot; 52&#146; and 66&#146; mill gondolas; coil gondolas; triple hoppers and hybrid aluminum/stainless steel railcars; ore hopper and gondola railcars; ballast hopper cars; aggregate hopper cars (with manual, independent or fully automatic transverse or longitudinal door systems); intermodal flats (including the 3-unit, 53-foot well cars) and non-intermodal flat cars (including slab, hot slab, ribbon rail and bulkhead flats). Focused product development activity continues in areas where we can leverage our technical knowledge base and capabilities to realize market opportunities. 

The types of railcars listed below include the major types of railcars that we are capable of manufacturing; however, some of the types of railcars listed below have not been ordered by any of our customers or manufactured by us in a number of years. We refurbish and rebuild railcars and sell forged, cast and fabricated parts for all of the railcars we produce, as well as those manufactured by others. Through September 30, 2015, we also provided general railcar repair and maintenance and inspections for all types of freight-carrying railcars. Many of our railcars are produced using a patented one-piece center sill, the main longitudinal structural component of the railcar. The one-piece center sill provides a higher carrying capacity, but weighs significantly less than traditional multiple-piece center sills. In addition to railcars designed for use in North America, we have manufactured railcars for export to Latin America and the Middle East. Railroads outside of North America are constructed with a variety of track gauges that are sized differently than in North America, which requires us, in some cases, to alter our manufacturing specifications accordingly. 

Any of the railcar types listed below may be further developed to meet the characteristics of the materials being transported and customer specifications. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Stainless Steel and Hybrid Stainless Steel/Aluminum Coal Cars . We manufacture a series of stainless steel and hybrid stainless steel and aluminum AutoFlood and BethGon coal cars designed to serve the Eastern railroads. These coal cars are designed to withstand the rigors of Eastern coal transportation service. They offer a unique balance of maximized payload, light weight, efficient unloading and long service life. Our coal car product offerings include aluminum-bodied flat-bottom gondola railcars and steel or stainless steel-bodied triple hopper railcars for coal, metallurgical coke and petroleum coke service. &#160;

&#149; &#160; VersaFlood Series. Our VersaFlood&#153; series open-top hopper railcars include steel, stainless steel or hybrid steel and aluminum-bodied designs equipped with three-pocket (transverse gate) or two-pocket (longitudinal gate) discharge door systems with manual, independent or fully automatic door operation. The VersaFlood&#153; product series offers versatile design options for transportation of aggregates, sand or minerals. &#160;

&#149; &#160; Covered Hopper Cars. Our covered hopper railcar product offerings encompass a wide range of cubic foot (cf) capacity designs for shipping dry bulk commodities of varying densities including: 3,282 cf covered hopper cars for cement, sand and roofing granules; 4,300 cf covered hopper cars for potash or similar commodities; 5,200 cf and 5,400 cf covered hopper cars for grain and other agricultural products; and 6,250 cf covered hopper cars for plastic pellets. &#160;

&#149; &#160; Dynastack Series . Our intermodal doublestack railcar product offerings include a stand-alone 40 foot well car, the DynaStack &#174; articulated, 5-unit, 40 foot and the DynaStack &#174; 3-unit, 53 foot well cars for transportation of international and domestic containers. &#160;

&#149; &#160; Boxcars . Our high capacity boxcar railcar product offering, featuring an inside length of 60&#146;9&#148;, capacity of 7,550 cf, double plug doors, galvanized steel roof panels and nailable steel floors, primarily designed for transporting paper products, paper rolls, lumber and wood products and foodstuffs. &#160;

&#149; &#160; Aluminum Coal Cars . The BethGon &#174; is the leader in the aluminum-bodied coal gondola railcar segment. Since we introduced the steel BethGon railcar in the late 1970s and the aluminum BethGon railcar in 1986, the BethGon railcar has become the most widely used coal car in North America. Our current BethGon II features lighter 

&#160;

&#160; weight, higher capacity and increased durability suitable for long-haul coal carrying railcar service. We have received several patents on the features of the BethGon II and continue to explore ways to increase the BethGon II&#146;s capacity and reliability. 

Our aluminum bodied open-top hopper railcar, the AutoFlood&#153;, is a five-pocket coal car equipped with a bottom discharge gate mechanism. We began manufacturing AutoFlood railcars in 1984, and introduced the AutoFlood II and AutoFlood III designs in 1996 and 2002, respectively. Both the AutoFlood II and AutoFlood III designs incorporate the automatic rapid discharge system, the MegaFlo&#153; door system, a patented mechanism that uses an over-center locking design, enabling the cargo door to close with tension rather than by compression. Further, AutoFlood railcars can be equipped with rotary couplers to permit rotary unloading. 

Other Railcar Types . Our portfolio of railcar types also includes 52&#146; and 66&#146; mill gondola railcars used to transport steel products and scrap; slab, hot slab and coil steel railcars designed specifically for transportation of steel slabs and coil steel products, respectively; non-intermodal flat railcars and bulkhead flat railcars designed to transport a variety of products, including machinery and equipment, steel and structural steel components (including pipe), wood and forest products and other bulk industrial products; woodchip hopper and gondola railcars designed to haul woodchips and municipal waste or other low-density commodities; and a variety of non-coal carrying open top hopper railcars designed to carry ballast, iron ore, taconite pellets and other bulk commodities; the AVC&#153; Aluminum Vehicle Carrier design used to transport commercial and light vehicles (automobiles and trucks) from assembly plants and ports to rail distribution centers; and the articulated bulk container railcar designed to carry dense bulk products such as waste products in 20 foot containers. 

MANUFACTURING 

We have railcar production facilities in Cherokee, Alabama, Danville, Illinois and Roanoke, Virginia. Our facilities are each certified or approved for certification by the Association of American Railroads (the &#147;AAR&#148;), which sets railcar manufacturing industry standards for quality control. Our Shoals manufacturing facility delivered its first railcars during the fourth quarter of 2013 and provides a solid platform from which to pursue a broad range of non-coal car business including intermodal well cars, non-intermodal flat cars and various open-top hopper, covered hopper and gondola cars. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced a $10 million expansion at our Shoals facility to add additional production capacity to meet demand for our new types of railcars. The new production capacity became operational in the second quarter of 2015. During 2015, we added approximately 360 employees to support increased production levels at our Shoals facility. Our Danville facility resumed production in June 2014 after being idled for 14 months. We will continue to adjust salaried and hourly labor personnel levels at all of our facilities to coincide with production requirements. 

Our manufacturing process involves four basic steps: fabrication, assembly, finishing and inspection. Each of our facilities has numerous checkpoints at which we inspect products to maintain quality control, a process that our operations management continuously monitors. In our fabrication processes, we employ standard metal working tools, many of which are computer controlled. Each assembly line typically involves 15 to 20 manufacturing positions, depending on the complexity of the particular railcar design. We use mechanical fastening in the fitting and assembly of our aluminum-bodied railcar parts, while we typically use welding for the assembly of our steel-bodied railcars. For aluminum-bodied railcars, we begin the finishing process by cleaning the railcar&#146;s surface and then applying the decals. In the case of steel-bodied railcars, we begin the finishing process by blasting the surface area of the railcar, painting it and then applying decals. Once we have completed the finishing process, our employees, along with representatives of the customer purchasing the particular railcars, inspect all railcars for adherence to specifications. 

CUSTOMERS 

We have strong long-term relationships with many large purchasers of railcars. Long-term customer relationships are particularly important in the railcar industry, given the limited number of buyers of railcars. 

Our customer base consists mostly of North American railroads, financial institutions and shippers. We believe that our customers&#146; preference for reliable, high-quality products, the relatively high cost for customers to switch manufacturers, our technological leadership in developing and enhancing innovative products and the competitive pricing of our railcars have helped us maintain our long-standing relationships with our customers. 

&#160;

In 2015, revenue from three customers, Norfolk Southern Railway Company, CSX Transportation Inc. and CitiCorp Railmark, Inc, accounted for approximately 22%, 19% and 10%, respectively, of total revenue. In 2015, sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately 64% of total revenue. In 2014, revenue from three customers, CSX Transportation Inc., SMBC Rail Services and Progress Rail Services Corporation, accounted for approximately 36%, 20% and 13%, respectively, of total revenue. In 2014, sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately 86% of total revenue. Our railcar sales to customers outside the United States were $62.6 million and $18.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Many of our customers do not purchase railcars every year since railcar fleets are not necessarily replenished or augmented every year. The size and frequency of railcar orders often results in a small number of customers representing a significant portion of our sales in a given year. 

SALES AND MARKETING 

Our direct sales group is organized geographically and consists of regional sales managers and contract administrators, a manager of customer service and support staff. The regional sales managers are responsible for managing customer relationships. Our contract administrators are responsible for preparing proposals and other inside sales activities. Our manager of customer service is responsible for after-sale follow-up and in-field product performance reviews. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

We utilize the latest engineering methods, tools and processes to ensure that new products and processes meet our customers&#146; requirements and are delivered in a timely manner. We develop and introduce new railcar designs as a result of a combination of customer feedback and close observation of developing market trends. We work closely with our customers to understand their expectations and design railcars that meet their needs. New product designs are tested and validated for compliance with AAR standards prior to introduction. This comprehensive approach provides the criteria and direction that ensure we are developing products that our customers desire and perform as expected. Costs associated with research and development are expensed as incurred and totaled $0.4 million, $0.3 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

BACKLOG 

We define backlog as the value of those products or services which our customers have committed in writing to purchase from us or lease from us when built, but which have not yet been recognized as sales. Our contracts may include cancellation clauses under which customers are required, upon cancellation of the contract, to reimburse us for costs incurred in reliance on an order and in some cases, to compensate us for lost profits. However, customer orders may be subject to customer requests for delays in railcar deliveries, inspection rights and other customary industry terms and conditions, which could prevent or delay backlog from being converted into sales. 

The following table depicts our reported railcar backlog in number of railcars and estimated future sales value attributable to such backlog, for the periods shown.

(1) Railcar backlog includes 0, 2,600 and 3,680 rebuilt railcars as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. (2) Estimated revenue from backlog reflects the total revenue attributable to the backlog reported at the end of the particular period as if such backlog were converted to actual sales. Estimated revenue from backlog does not reflect potential price increases and decreases under customer contracts that provide for variable pricing based on changes in the cost of raw materials. Although we continually look for opportunities to package our leased assets for sale to our leasing company partners, these leased assets may not be converted to sales. &#160;

Although our reported backlog is typically converted to sales within two years, our reported backlog may not be converted to sales in any particular period, if at all, and the actual sales from these contracts may not equal our reported backlog estimates. See Item 1A. &#147;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Business&#151;The level of our reported backlog may not necessarily indicate what our future sales will be and our actual sales may fall short of the estimated sales value attributed to our backlog.&#148; In addition, due to the large size of railcar orders and variations in the mix of railcars, the size of our reported backlog at the end of any given period may fluctuate significantly. See Item 1A. &#147;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to the Railcar Industry&#151;The variable purchase patterns of our customers and the timing of completion, delivery and customer acceptance of the railcar may cause our revenues and income from operations to vary substantially each quarter, which will result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly results.&#148; 

SUPPLIERS AND MATERIALS 

The cost of raw materials and components represents a substantial majority of the manufacturing costs of most of our railcar product lines. As a result, the management of raw materials and components purchasing is critical to our profitability. We enjoy generally strong relationships with our suppliers, which helps to ensure access to supplies when railcar demand is high. 

Our primary aluminum suppliers are Sapa Extrusions and Constellium N.V. (formerly Alcan Inc.). Aluminum prices generally are fixed at the time a railcar order is accepted, mitigating the effect of future fluctuations in prices. Our primary stainless steel supplier is Crompion International, L.L.C. and our primary carbon steel suppliers are International Truck and Engine Investments Corporation, an affiliate of Navistar, Inc., O&#146;Neal Steel Inc. and Roll Form Group. 

Our primary component suppliers include Amsted Industries, Inc., which supplies us with truck components, brake components, couplers and bearings, and Summit Railroad Products, Inc., which supplies us with axles and wheels. Roll Form Group is the sole supplier of our roll-formed center sills, which were used in 77% and 88% of our new railcars produced in 2015 and 2014, respectively. A center sill is the primary structural component of a railcar. In addition, during 2013, we entered into an agreement with International Truck and Engine Investments Corporation, an affiliate of Navistar, Inc., pursuant to which it has contracted to supply us with various fabricated parts, components and subassemblies as well as providing truck and wheel and axle assembly services and blast and paint finishing services primarily for our Shoals facility. Other suppliers provide brake systems, castings, bearings, fabrications and various other components. The railcar industry is periodically subject to supply constraints for some of the key railcar components. See Item 1A. &#147;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to the Railcar Industry&#151;Limitations on the supply of railcar components could adversely affect our business because they may limit the number of railcars we can manufacture.&#148; 

Except as described above, there are usually at least two suppliers for each of our raw materials and specialty components. No single supplier accounted for more than 16% and 17% of our total purchases in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our top ten suppliers accounted for 58% and 65% of our total purchases in 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

COMPETITION 

We operate in a competitive marketplace. Competition is based on price, delivery timing, product design, reputation for product quality and customer service and support. 

We have four principal competitors in the North American railcar market that primarily manufacture railcars for third-party customers, which are Trinity Industries, Inc., The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., American Railcar Industries, Inc. and National Steel Car Limited. 

Competition in the North American market from railcar manufacturers located outside of North America is limited by, among other factors, high shipping costs and familiarity with the North American market. 

&#160;

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

We have several U.S. and international patents and pending applications, registered trademarks, copyrights and trade names. Key patents include our one-piece center sill, our hopper railcar with automatic individual door system and our railroad car tub. The protection of our intellectual property is important to our business. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 1,662 employees, of whom 233 were salaried and 1,429 were hourly wage earners, and approximately 381, or 23%, of our employees were members of unions. As of December 31, 2014, we had 1,381 employees, of whom 230 were salaried and 1,151 were hourly wage earners, and approximately 402, or 29%, of our employees were members of unions. See Item 1A. &#147;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Business&#151;Labor disputes could disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our management and may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.&#148; 

REGULATION 

The Federal Railroad Administration, or FRA, administers and enforces U.S. federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety. These regulations govern equipment and safety compliance standards for freight railcars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce. The AAR promulgates a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment, relationships among railroads with respect to freight railcars in interchange and other matters. The AAR also certifies freight railcar manufacturers and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the United States as well as providers of railcar repair and maintenance services. New products must generally undergo AAR testing and approval processes. As a result of these regulations, we must maintain certifications with the AAR as a freight railcar manufacturer and provider of railcar repair and maintenance services, and products that we sell must meet AAR and FRA standards. 

We are also subject to oversight in other jurisdictions by foreign regulatory agencies and to the extent that we expand our business internationally, we will increasingly be subject to the regulations of other non-U.S. jurisdictions. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

We are subject to comprehensive federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment, the management, use, processing, handling, storage, transport or disposal of hazardous materials, or otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the environment. These laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own negligent acts, but also may expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken. In addition, these laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance, and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations. Civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with these environmental laws and regulations. Our operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under the common law. 

Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for our operations under these laws and regulations. These operating permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. We regularly monitor and review our operations, procedures and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations. Despite these compliance efforts, risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our businesses, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We believe that our operations and facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. 

Future events, such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of products or business activities, may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. In addition, we have in the past conducted investigation and remediation activities at properties that we own to address historic contamination. To date, such costs have not been material. Although we believe we have satisfactorily addressed all known material contamination through our remediation activities, there can be no assurance that these activities have addressed all historic contamination. The discovery of historic contamination or the release of hazardous substances into the environment could require us in the future to incur investigative or remedial costs or other liabilities that could be material or that could interfere with the operation of our business. 

&#160;

In addition to environmental laws, the transportation of commodities by railcar raises potential risks in the event of a derailment or other accident. Generally, liability under existing law in the United States for a derailment or other accident depends on the negligence of the party, such as the railroad, the shipper or the manufacturer of the railcar or its components. However, for the shipment of certain hazardous commodities, strict liability concepts may apply.
