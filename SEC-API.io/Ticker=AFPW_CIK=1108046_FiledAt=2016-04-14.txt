 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

&#160;

(a) General development of business. 

&#160;

We were incorporated in the state of Nevada on January 19, 2000 under the name Organic Soils.Com, Inc. Effective September 5, 2014, the Company changed its corporate domicile from Nevada to Wyoming. 

&#160;

Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of March 24, 2005 (the "Share Exchange Agreement"), by and between Organic Soils.com, Inc. and Inhibetex Therapeutics, Inc., a Colorado corporation ("Inhibetex"), Organic Soils.com, Inc. and Inhibetex entered into a share exchange whereby all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Inhibetex, on a fully-diluted basis, were exchanged for like securities of Organic Soils.com, Inc., and whereby Inhibetex became a wholly owned subsidiary of Organic Soils.com, Inc. (the "Share Exchange"). The Share Exchange was effective as of May 19, 2005 at which time we also changed our name to Inhibiton Therapeutics, Inc. (the "Registrant" or the "Company"). 

&#160;

Pursuant to an Agreement Concerning the Exchange of Securities by and among the Company, HPI Partners, LLC ("HPI"), a Colorado Limited Liability Company, and the Security Holders of HPI Partners, LLC (the "HPI Members") dated March 4, 2009, (the "Share Exchange Agreement"), the parties entered into a share exchange whereby all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of HPI were exchanged for 171,123,297 shares of the Company's $0.001 par value common stock and 418,500 shares of the Company's $0.001 par value Series A Preferred Stock, through which HPI and its wholly-owned subsidiary AlumiFuel Power, Inc. ("API") became a wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company (the "Share Exchange"). The 418,500 shares of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock automatically converted to 34,397,261 shares of the Company's $0.001 par value common stock upon approval by the Company's stockholders of an increase in the number of authorized common shares effective on May 28, 2009. In addition, the HPI Members received warrants to purchase up to 14,302,500 shares of the Company's $0.001 par value common stock, in exchange for a like number of HPI warrants that are exercisable until March 4, 2012 at an exercise price of $0.12 per share. The Share Exchange was effective as of May 5, 2009, upon closing of the transaction among the parties.

&#160;

&#160; 2 

&#160; &#160;

This acquisition was treated as a reverse-merger with HPI being the accounting acquirer including a recapitalization of its equity with Inhibiton Therapeutics, Inc. as the legal surviving entity. Effective on May 28, 2009, the Company changed its name from Inhibiton Therapeutics, Inc. to AlumiFuel Power Corporation. As a result of this transaction, the Company has ceased any further operations related to its previous cancer therapy research and development business. 

&#160;

In February 2010, the Company formed its new subsidiary, AlumiFuel Power International, Inc. ("AFPI"). In connection with the formation of the AFPI, the Company and AFPI executed a License Agreement through which AFPI received certain international marketing rights and the rights to utilize certain intellectual property from the Company for exploitation in countries and territories outside of North America in exchange for 25,000,000 shares of the Company's $0.001 par value common stock. The Company also purchased 15,000,000 shares of AFPI common stock at $0.01 per share. On July 31, 2011, the Company and AFPI executed a Patent Purchase Agreement through which the Company sold AFPI the international patent rights to certain of the Company's intellectual property. In exchange for the sale of these rights, the Company received 7,500,000 shares of AFPI common stock. As of December 31, 2015, we owned 39,599,879 shares of AFPI common stock or 58% of the shares outstanding. 

&#160;

In December 2011, we formed a new wholly owned subsidiary, AlumiFuel Power Technologies, Inc. ("APTI"), but didn't begin significant operations until February 2012. APTI was formed as a separate entity to leverage the Company's hydrogen generation technology to take advantage of potential complimentary technologies. 

&#160;

In December 2012, we formed a new wholly owned subsidiary, NovoFuel, Inc. ("NovoFuel") and in 2013 transferred all of the assets related to our hydrogen generation business to NovoFuel in exchange for 12,000,000 shares of its common stock; 2,000,000 of which were allocated to our majority-owned subsidiary, AFPI, in exchange for the return of the European intellectual property and marketing rights back to the Company for use by NovoFuel. Novofuel was formed as a separate entity in anticipation of executing a transaction with Genport, SrL of Italy. In November 2013, the Company signed an agreement with Genport, SrL of Italy to combine and integrate their technologies, assets and operations into NovoFuel, contingent upon closing of private financing of up to $4,500,000 for the venture. As of the date of this report, this financing has not been completed and Genport has notified the Company it no longer wishes to move forward with the project as planned. 

&#160;

PATENT APPROVAL . NovoFuel has been notified by the U.S. Patent and Trademark office (USPTO) that the provisional patent on its hydrogen generation technology has been allowed, and U.S. Patent No. 8,974,765 was issued on March 10, 2015. The omnibus provisional patent application, "METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLED PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN USING ALUMINUM-BASED WATER-SPLIT REACTIONS", was filed in 2009, and went through a comprehensive review by the USPTO. The approved patent embodies 48 specific claims which are applications-oriented, focusing on the practical aspects of controlling the aluminum powder-water reaction in NovoFuel's cartridge-based hydrogen generation system used in such applications as feeding fuel cells for backup power and filling weather balloons. 

&#160;

In their opinion letter for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, our auditors included an explanatory paragraph that disclosed conditions that raise concerns about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Please refer to the audited financial statements and accompanying auditors report within this filing. 

&#160;

(b) Financial information about segments.

&#160; Through December 31, 2015, we operated in only one industry segment. 

&#160; (c) Narrative description of business. 

&#160;

&#160; 3 

&#160; &#160;

AlumiFuel Power Corporation is a company that during 2015 operated primarily through its subsidiary NovoFuel. We are an early production stage alternative energy company that generates hydrogen gas and superheated steam through the chemical reaction of aluminum, water, and proprietary additives. This technology is ideally suited for multiple niche applications requiring on-site, on-demand fuel sources, serving National Security and commercial customers. Hydrogen generated by our products can fill inflatable devices such as weather balloons, feed fuel cells for portable and back-up power, and can replace costly, hard-to-handle and high pressure K-Cylinders. Our hydrogen/heat output is also being designed and developed to drive turbine-based underwater propulsion systems and auxiliary power systems, and as the fuel for Flameless Ration Heaters. Our technology has significant differentiators in performance, adaptability, safety and cost-effectiveness in its target market applications, with no external power required and no toxic chemicals or by-products. This unique technology is based on the exothermic chemical reaction of aluminum powder and water. 

&#160;

The Company's first commercially available product was the PBIS-1000 portable balloon inflation device. Existing technologies for balloon inflation include: hydrogen and helium cylinders; assorted toxic solid fuel systems; expensive on-site electrolysis; and unwieldy chemical hydrogen generators. Our technology utilizes a unique, simple portable generation/launching system that is: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Field deployable

&#160; &#160;

&#183; 

Can be launched at remote locations

&#160; &#160;

&#183; 

Is a cost-effective total system solution

&#160; &#160;

&#183; 

Is portable and easy to use

&#160; &#160;

&#183; 

Is made of non-toxic materials

&#160;

As a result of input from the initial customer, the Company worked to produce a quieter more rugged next generation PBIS-1000 unit that was a significant upgrade over the system produced and sold in 2010. The next generation unit has a simpler design with fewer components, and is lighter, more compact, more ruggedized for military applications, more user-friendly and quieter. Using a higher grade stainless steel construction with better corrosion properties and durable fluorocarbon rubber for all seals, the upgraded unit can better withstand required pressures and temperatures over its long expected lifetime. The reactor and water tanks, as well as all plumbing lines and connectors, were optimized for weight, simplicity, and cost, and are stamped and certified with the ASME code &#8211; a standard requirement for commercial pressure vessels. The unit meets military specification requirements for vibration, environmental and drop tests, and is housed in a molded polyethylene carrying case used regularly by the military. 

&#160;

In addition, a more effective packaging configuration of the company's proprietary AlumiFuel fuel cartridges increases the speed of the reaction and the hydrogen yield, while reducing cartridge cost. The versatile PBIS-1000 unit can produce 1,000 liters of hydrogen in 20 minutes at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure using only two 32oz AlumiFuel cartridges. 

&#160;

In 2011, we were awarded a contract with the United States Air Force Special Operations Command to deliver a PBIS-2000 Portable Balloon Inflation System. Originally slated for delivery in late February 2012, working with the customer the Company delivered the unit in April 2012. In September 2012, we received a Purchase Order/Contract from the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command to make certain modifications to the PBIS-2000 delivered in April 2012. These modifications were made and the unit was returned to the customer in January 2013. 

&#160;

&#160; 4 

&#160; &#160;

The PBIS-2000 expands the capability of the hydrogen generators we can produce, which includes the PBIS-1000 (for 100g balloons) and the PBIS-lite (designed for 30g pieball balloons). The PBIS-2000 generates sufficient hydrogen to inflate a 200g weather balloon within 20 minutes using up to 6 AlumiFuel Cartridges contained in a single reactor vessel; this represents significantly more hydrogen than is required for the PBIS-1000. While the footprint, weight and safety features of the PBIS-2000 are similar to the PBIS-1000, the configuration has been modified such that the system operates at ambient (atmospheric) pressure (below 10 psig) so that the user never has to deal with a high pressure system such as the industry standard K-Cylinder (2265 psig). 

&#160;

The PBIS series of man-portable reactorand launching units use our proprietary AlumiFuel technology to produce hydrogen through the powerful chemical reaction of powdered aluminum, water and proprietary additives. The devices require only a simple water hand pump and two to six small AlumiFuel cartridges to propagate the reaction and generate sufficient lift gas to launch a 5-foot diameter weather balloon. This innovation, which enables on the spot generation of hydrogen without any external energy or toxic chemicals, is easier to use and is cheaper than current lift gas solutions. Traditionally, helium has been used as the primary lift gas, but with the increasing scarcity and cost of helium, users are realizing the benefits of switching to hydrogen. These portable launching units are far more mobile and cost effective than other on-site hydrogen generation systems. The Company estimates the current weather balloon lift gas market remains $150-$200 million per year and encompasses military as well as civil government meteorological users worldwide; with more than 1,000,000 weather balloons and special purpose balloons launched annually for telecom relay, cloud height measurement and military/national security applications. The customer base for the PBIS units includes various governmental users both civil and military, however, due to limits in our working capital we have not been able to effectively market our products with these users. 

&#160;

Our AlumiFuel cartridges utilize standard 32 oz aluminum drink cans and our "stuffing" can be outsourced to a third party volume packager/assembler with industrial scale packaging techniques &#38; processes. The packager is able to support all product applications and provides shipping/distribution/supply chain logistics while we control our proprietary additives. Each 32 oz cartridge generates 500 liters of hydrogen equaling approximately 100 watts of power for 16 hours in a non-toxic can that can be thrown away in any municipal dump after use. 

&#160;

However, with recent federal budget cuts, the procurement process and new technology R&#38;D funding relating to the Company's systems have come to a virtual standstill. This has caused the company to shift focus on backup power applications for selected commercial applications, where there is a real demand and funding available for renewable energy solutions. Two notable examples are 5kW backup power hydrogen fuel cells for telecom rooftop cell towers, and a hybrid array of renewable energy components (wind, solar, lithium-ion battery, fuel cells and energy management and control systems) for cannabis cultivation -- an enormous and rapidly growing multi-billion dollar market. In fact, medical marijuana is now the fastest growing market in North America, surpassing mobile phones. 

&#160;

We believe our technology is different because: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Tomorrow's fuel today; hydrogen generated on-demand, on-site, off-grid

&#160;

o No storage or delivery issues as with other hydrogen generation processes

&#160; o No reformers

&#160; o No hydrogen processors

&#160; o No electrolysis

&#160; o No post-production compression or storage

&#160; o No expensive new hydrogen infrastructure required

&#160; o Novel packaging of aluminum powder &#38; additives into cartridges

&#160; o Inserting cartridge and water into portable generator produces .999 pure hydrogen

&#160;

&#160; 5 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Cost-effective total system life cycle

&#160;

o Abundant, inexpensive raw materials (aluminum + additives)

&#160; o Low-cost production

&#160; o Novel and efficient hydrogen generation process - no energy consumption in creating or compressing hydrogen

&#160; o Commercially usable neutral byproducts &#8211; spent powder is recyclable

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Environmentally friendly and safe

&#160;

o Non-toxic, impurity-free products throughout life-cycle

&#160; o Pollution-free, safe and manageable production processes

&#160; o Clean burn - no harmful emissions; no carbon monoxide, carbo dioxide, or sulfur compounds produced

&#160; o Reaction initiated under ambient conditions - no external energy input required

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Competitive advantages

&#160;

o Generates 1.2 cubic meters of hydrogen per 1kg of aluminum &#8211; 95% efficiency is 10% better than for methanol reforming

&#160; o None of methanol's highly toxic or inflammable qualities

&#160; o Demonstrated gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity of 10% is equivalent to methanol without the safety/handling downsides

&#160; o No toxic/hazardous/corrosive disposal or transportation issues with fuel (active or spent) as with other hydrogen generation technologies

&#160; o No degradation in production of hydrogen by cartridges during lifetime storage testing

&#160; o Very high usable energy densities &#8211; 3.2kWh/l and 3.1kWh/kg &#8211; up to 5X greater energy density than Lithium-ion batteries

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Practical ability to engineer reactions at required scales and durations

&#160; &#160;

&#183; 

Can displace current technologies/products

&#160;

&#160; 6 

&#160; 

&#160;

Other potential products include hydrogen/steam generators including turbine-based underwater propulsion systems , drop-in recyclable cartridges and flameless heater packs. Ours is an enabling technology that can deliver up to five times the energy density (runtime) of lithium batteries, which can open up doors for new power applications. 

&#160;

Of equal importance to the weather balloon market, the PBIS product family can easily be tailored to feed fuel cells to generate electricity for back-up, stand-by, auxiliary and portable power. We have had ongoing discussions with major fuel cell companies regarding technology collaboration for other applications. 

&#160;

At the present time, marijuana growing for medicinal purposes is legalized in 23 U.S. states, and there is pending legislation to follow suit in other states. Four states, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Colorado have also legalized it for recreational purposes. Marijuana growing is legalized throughout Canada. 

&#160;

This has become a major growth industry, with billions of dollars expected to be expended over the next several years. Growers range from mom-and-pop operations to large greenhouse facilities. This rapid growth and energy intensive profile have triggered a serious problem regarding the use of local grid power to assure successful cultivation &#8211; involving special lights, heat, air conditioning, dehumidifiers, driers and other ancillary equipment for indoor locations, and massive irrigation for outdoor operations. Even a typical one room indoor facility can use up to 10kW of power daily, which can be a tremendous burden on the local power utilities; this situation has already caused power outages and brown-outs in certain Colorado municipalities. A 2011 study on energy use in the industry shows that the energy consumption will be over 1% of national electricity consumption and create greenhouse gas pollution equivalent to that of 3 million automobiles. This can expect to increase as the industry becomes more fully developed. 

&#160;

As an increasing number of states gear up for medical and recreational marijuana programs, and as Canada implements the Marijuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (MMPR) program, warehouses and secure indoor gardening facilities are expanding operations to meet the industry's expected growth. Some communities have already taken steps to require cannabis grow operations to be powered by renewable energy sources to lessen the industry's carbon footprint. 

&#160;

This rapidly expanding growing industry has led to the introduction of entirely new marijuana product applications such as the use of the stalks and stems to make paper, a cheaper and "greener" approach than using wood as the feed stock. This development has raised the stakes with big players, such as the tobacco companies, are now exploring entering this arena, and traditional farmers are considering cannabis as a profitable and easy-to-grow new crop. The ability to get carbon credits from the federal government and to get tax credits under the Farm Bill for growing a new commodity, adds to the attractiveness of this new crop for farmers. 

&#160;

In response to the enormous and rapidly expanding energy requirements of legal cannabis growers in the U.S. and Canada, NovoFuel conducted a network modeling analysis to determine optimized Renewable Energy System (RES) solutions for cannabis cultivation -- using hybrid "plug and play" systems. The analysis used sophisticated micro grid modeling tools to assess on and off-grid applications encompassing solar panel and mini-wind turbine power systems, large format lithium-ion batteries for energy storage and backup, inverters and converters, and, where applicable, hydrogen fuel cells &#8211; all integrated on a real-time basis by a world-class energy management &#38; control software system which provides the power electronics for all RES components. 

&#160;

The analysis resulted in the development of a range of optimized hybrid RES configurations for various cultivation scenarios, and the design of a pilot RES solution for a specific location in Michigan (one of the now 23 US states to legalize medical marijuana). In the Michigan pilot site solution, off-grid Renewable Energy Systems would provide 52% of the total required energy load on site, supplementing and reducing the reliance on local utility grid power. For the Michigan site, specific commercially available hardware has been selected for the initial design, subject to modification in the final design. According to the NovoFuel plan, once the pilot configuration is fully tested out, installed, and passes site acceptance, comparable RES solutions would be expanded to other locations and other states, as well as Canada. In this process, as is the case in Michigan, NovoFuel would actively work with growers and electric power contractors in the local areas. NovoFuel believes it can field cost-effective solutions with prices that are competitive with traditional fossil-fuel based power systems. This entire process will take a significant amount of capital, however, and there is no assurance the Company will be successful in raising the funds necessary for the pilot site, research and development, and implementation of any successful solutions. 

&#160;

&#160; 7 

&#160; &#160;

As previously mentioned, RES solutions are also ideal to power irrigation for large scale outdoor cannabis cultivation and other farming, mining and oilfield applications, where the required energy can be provided totally or partially off-grid, with a reduced life-cycle cost over a 20-year period. RES components are thought to be roughly one-fifth the cost of comparable fossil-fuel generators, eliminate harmful emissions, and lessen the need for foreign oil. Apart from specific applications, renewable energy systems are the fastest growing power source globally (6% per year) -- expected to increase by 40% and comprise 25% of gross power generation by 2018. 

&#160;

Although we have done the work necessary to locate a pilot site in Oceana County, Michigan to build an operating RES system, there is no assurance we will be able to raise the funds necessary to complete installation of the necessary components or if we do, that the system will function as intended such that a commercially viable product will be produced. 

&#160;

During 2015, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Lithium Battery Engineering, LLC and Custom Electronics, Inc. to explore the design and production of lithium-ion batteries to be marketed under the NovoFuel name. Target markets include large North American opportunities such as cannabis grow operations, and U.S. sponsored Power Africa rural and remote electrification. The stand-alone market for this type of battery is estimated at over $300,000,000 in North America, and $5 billion worldwide. The proposed NovoFuel 2.5kW battery is proposed to provide critical backup power for a variety of applications, including homes, and telecom cell sites -- replacing old-technology lead acid batteries which have numerous disadvantages in cycle life, energy density, size, battery management system, and cleanliness of operations. Moving forward with this initiative will require significant additional capital which there is no assurance the Company can successfully raise. 

&#160;

The Hydrogen Economy 

&#160;

Current applications include selected utility vehicles, and back-up, auxiliary, portable and remote power generation. Although Honda Motor Corporation has produced a vehicle for lease in California, it is anticipated a mass market for automotive applications won't occur until later in this decade. Current public perception is that the hydrogen economy is tied to the automotive market. The Company believes the following must occur to commercialize automotive applications: volume manufacturing, lower cost and increased reliability of hydrogen fuel cells must be achieved; automakers must adopt the increased use of fuel cells; a new fuel distribution infrastructure including bulk hydrogen production plants near dispersed customers, (e.g. service stations) must be built. 

&#160;

The Company believes there is limited public awareness of substantial and growing pre-automotive markets being driven by early adopters of hydrogen technology. These technologies include hydrogen fuel cells for back-up, portable and auxiliary power applications as well as the delivery of longer run-times, lower emissions, cheaper operations than present battery, generator sets, diesel, and other technologies. 

&#160;

The Company also believes its technology can impact the hydrogen economy through the favorable economics of supply and demand and a push for "green" energy to drive the hydrogen industry to evolve on many scales for many applications. As the increased demand for pre-automotive fuel cells will decrease cost of components and create viable supplier base for automotive fuel cells, API believes it is in the forefront of the transition to the hydrogen economy. Our technology and products will help accelerate the transition including "sweet spot" applications (back-up, portable, auxiliary and remote power) to facilitate increased usage and capability of hydrogen fuel cells. We believe we can leverage our cheaper logistics chain to replace delivery of hard-to-handle K-cylinders for hydrogen storage. The Company's unique non-fuel cell applications can facilitate early market entry and a providing a source of revenue while fuel cell applications mature. 

&#160;

In today's pre-automotive market, hydrogen can be used to power nearly every end-use energy need. Fuel cells&#8212; which directly convert the chemical energy in hydrogen to electricity with only water and heat as byproducts&#8212;are the key to making it happen. Hydrogen-fueled Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (also called Proton Exchange Membrane or "PEM") fuel cells are leading can-didates for use in fuel cell vehicles. Although it will be a while before fuel cell vehicles reach every dealer's showroom, PEM fuel cells are commer-cially available today for certain applica-tions &#8211; most notably: backup power (1-10kW), portable power (50W &#8211; 1kW), and specialty vehicles. The largest of these near-term markets is emergency backup power, with an addressable market of $5 billion in the near term. Today's commercially available PEM fuel cells are particularly appropriate for these applications requiring intermittent backup. This includes a wide range of communication and data control systems for which backup power is essential. 

&#160;

&#160; 8 

&#160; &#160;

Backup power technologies currently include batteries and generators operat-ing on diesel, propane, or gasoline. Most backup power communication and control systems use a combination of generators and batteries to provide redundancy to avoid service disruptions. Although these systems are reliable and well established, concerns with bat-teries and generators are encouraging customers to seek out alternatives that provide high reliability and durability at a reasonable cost. Compared to batteries, fuel cells offer longer continuous runtime and greater durability in harsh outdoor environments under a wide range of temperature conditions. With fewer mov-ing parts, they require less maintenance than both generators and batteries. They can also be monitored remotely, reducing actual maintenance time. Compared to generators, fuel cells are quieter and have no emissions.PEM fuel cells can also offer significant cost advantages over both battery-gen-erator systems and battery-only systems when shorter run-time capability of up to three days is sufficient. In a study for the U.S. Department of Energy, Battelle Memorial Institute analyzed lifecycle costs of emergency response radio towers, comparing fuel cells with 2 kW battery-only backup of 8 hours and 5 kW battery-generator backup of 52 hours, 72 hours, and 176 hours. On a lifecycle basis, PEM fuel cells can provide service at substantially lower total cost than current technologies (the higher cost of the 176- hour fuel cell system results from the cost of hydrogen storage tank rental). 

&#160;

Portable Power applications, including emergency response, man-portable soldier power, battery charger, emergency medical equipment power, outdoor mobile camera surveillance, entertainment mobile power and recreational power, represent a $3.3 billion market in the near term. As each year passes, hydrogen fuel cells capture an increasingly larger share of this market from older technologies such as fossil-fuel gensets and batteries. Moreover, novel hybrid solutions can involve a combination of fuel cells and lithium-ion batteries. The ArcView Group characterizes the current market as follows: "The US national legal marijuana market value is now assessed at $1.53 billion (2013), comprising all states that have active and open sales of cannabis to people legally allowed to possess it under state law. The national market is projected to grow 68 percent from current levels to $2.57 billion by 2014. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Since hydrogen power generation technologies have the potential to replace existing power products, competition will come from improvements to current power technologies and from new alternative energy technologies. Each potential target market is currently serviced by existing manufacturers with existing customers and suppliers. These manufacturers use proven and widely accepted technologies such as internal combustion engines and turbines as well as coal, oil, electricity and nuclear powered generators. 

&#160;

There are a number of companies using reforming technologies for hydrogen generation, including, Airgas, H2Gen, Air Products, HyGear, and others. While many of these companies are further down the commercialization and production road, we believe our hydrogen generation technology is less expensive than a reformer-based approach for potential target applications, and that the technology is superior to other non-reforming hydrogen generation technologies in terms of cost, weight, safety and use of non-toxic materials. 

&#160;

Additionally, there are competitors working on developing technologies using other than hydrogen power generation systems (such as fuel cells, advanced Lithium-ion batteries, battery/fuel cell hybrids and hybrid battery/ICEs) like Tesla, Ballard Power and Plug Power in certain targeted markets. 

&#160;

There are many different individuals, institutions and companies across the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan, including corporations, national laboratories and universities that are actively engaged in the development and manufacture of alternative energy technologies including hydrogen generation technologies. Each of these competitors has the potential to capture market share in any potential future target markets. 

&#160;

Many of these competitors have substantial financial resources, customer bases, strategic alliances, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities, and businesses or other resources which give them significant competitive advantages over us. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

We are not currently subject to any specific governmental regulations other than those common to any operating business. While we believe our hydrogen power generation products are environmentally benign, we may be subject to national or local environmental laws regarding the disposal or recycling of aluminum or water waste or other unforeseen by-products from our developing technologies. Additionally, we may be subject to customary regulations related to the shipment of hazardous materials for our AlumiFuel cartridges. 

&#160;

&#160; 9 

&#160; &#160;

It is possible that we will encounter industry-specific government regulations in the future in any jurisdictions in which we may operate. Regulatory approvals may be required for the design, installation and operation of stationary and mobile hydrogen fuel stations and other fuel cell systems should we successfully develop and implement those products. It is our intention to comply with all necessary governmental regulations that may be imposed on products or services we develop for commercial use. Any delay in gaining necessary regulatory approval for future products or services could cause a delay in our development and growth. 

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

We have not expensed any monies on direct research and development costs during the past two years. Any research and development costs incurred in the future will not include the day-to-day operating costs associated with our operations but will include expenses for laboratory supplies, design and development costs not directly related to the manufacturing process of our products. We have been working in 2015 on initiatives to design and field hybrid renewable energy solutions for medical cannabis grow operations and potentially oilfield operations; as well as potential lithium-ion battery production, and will only expend further research and development costs in anticipation of future new products, if any. It is anticipated that any products developed for any new initiatives will require significant research and development expenditures and other related costs. There is no assurance the Company will be able to fund those costs at the times and in the amounts necessary to further product development in these areas, if at all. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We currently have one full-time employee located in the Philadelphia area. This does not include our corporate officers who each devote at least thirty hours per week on the operations of the Company, outsourced administrative personnel or our Chief Technical Officer who works as a consultant on an as needed basis. 

&#160;
