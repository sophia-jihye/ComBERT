 Item 1. Business &#160; 

Introduction 

&#160; 

We are a blank check company incorporated in April 2015 as a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses. 

&#160; 

Objective and Business Opportunity 

&#160;

While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geographical location, we are focused on industries that complement our management team&#8217;s background and capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify and acquire a business, focusing on the industrial manufacturing, distribution or services sector in the United States (which may include a business based in the United States which has operations or opportunities outside of the United States). We are seeking to acquire one or more businesses with an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $500 million to $1 billion. 

&#160;

Our strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, build, an industrial manufacturing, distribution or services business. Industrial manufacturers, distributors and service providers are companies that manufacture and/or distribute products or provide critical services to a broad range of customers and end use markets. We believe that an industrial &#8220;renaissance&#8221; is now underway in the United States and that this resurgence is primarily the result of three critical cost factors: (i) a stable and flexible labor market, (ii) cheap and abundant sources of energy and (iii) logistical factors such as shipping costs and the various risks of operating extended global supply chains, each of which we believe is quite favorable to the United States when compared with advanced manufacturing nations and increasingly competitive when compared with emerging manufacturing nations. 

&#160;

According to the Boston Consulting Group, or BCG, the manufacturing-cost gap between the U.S. and other highly developed economies widened significantly over the last decade. Stable and efficient labor is one key to growing the U.S. competitive advantage. The U.S. has one of the world&#8217;s most flexible labor markets and has the highest worker productivity among the world&#8217;s largest exporters by far. Adjusted for productivity, U.S. labor costs are 20% to 54% lower than those of Western Europe and Japan for many products. Productivity-adjusted wages have grown only 8% in the U.S. from 2004-2014 while such wages have almost tripled in China. 

&#160;

In addition to the benefits of its labor force, the U.S. also has an energy cost advantage. While industrial prices for natural gas have risen around the world, they have decreased by approximately 50% in the U.S. since the recovery from underground shale deposits began in earnest. Natural gas currently costs more than three times as much in China, France and Germany than in the U.S., and nearly four times as much in Japan. Natural gas is used increasingly as a fuel in U.S. power plants, which is likely to ensure that the price of industrial electricity will remain between one-quarter and two-thirds of the cost of electricity in major exporting nations such as China, Japan, Germany, France and Italy. We believe cheap natural gas will give the U.S. a powerful and unique cost advantage that will benefit a wide variety of industries across the full value chain, from feedstock to finished goods, and should be largely exclusive to the U.S. for the foreseeable future. 

&#160;

When taking all of this into account, the U.S. has emerged as the lowest-cost manufacturing location in the developed world, and at the same time, has achieved approximate cost parity with low-cost countries in Eastern Europe. The cost gap with China has shrunk dramatically, and, if the trend of the last ten years continues, will likely disappear before the end of the decade. 

&#160;

We believe these factors are further compounded when adding logistical factors to the decision making process. Factors such as shipping costs, the various risks of operating extended global supply chains, just-in-time inventory requirements and shorter product life cycles necessitate that production and end-markets be co-located. According to BCG, the U.S. and Mexico are the &#8220;rising stars&#8221; of the top 25 export economies because of low wage growth, sustained productivity gains, stable exchange rates and significant energy and electricity cost advantages.

&#160;

&#160;

Hennessy Capital LLC is the managing member of our sponsor and was founded by Daniel J. Hennessy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2013. From September 2013 to February 2015, Mr. Hennessy served as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp., or Hennessy 1, which merged with School Bus Holdings Inc., or SBH, in February 2015 and is now known as Blue Bird Corporation (NASDAQ: BLBD), and since February 2015, has served as its Vice Chairman. Mr. Hennessy serves as a Partner at Code Hennessy &#38; Simmons LLC (n/k/a CHS Capital or &#8220;CHS&#8221;) a middle-market private equity investment firm he co-founded in 1988. Over a 25-year period, CHS invested $2.8 billion in 395 operating companies with aggregate revenues of approximately $15 billion. Mr. Hennessy has served as Chairman of the Board and Director of CHS portfolio companies that manufacture and/or distribute a broad array of products or provide services for the industrial, infrastructure, energy and packaging sectors including: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#10148; Dura-Line Holdings, a producer of high-density polyethylene conduit and pipes (from 2012 to 2014); &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; Thermon Group Holdings (NYSE: THR), a designer and manufacturer of heat tracing systems focused on the external application of heat to pipes, tanks and instrumentation (from 2010 to 2011); &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; Penhall International, a provider of concrete cutting, breaking, excavation and highway grinding services (from 2006 to 2010); &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; GSE Environmental, a supplier of geosynthetic liners and products (from 2004 to 2011); &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; WNA, a designer and manufacturer of upscale plastic disposable tableware products (from 2002 to 2007); and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; Kranson Industries (n/k/a TricorBraun), a distributor of plastic and glass containers (from 1999 to 2004). &#160;

Mr. Hennessy has over 25 years of middle-market private equity investment experience, dedicated almost entirely to investments in industrial manufacturing, distribution or services operating companies. He has initiated and overseen numerous add-on acquisitions, divestitures, IPOs and debt capital markets issues for CHS-owned companies and is well known by the most active middle-market private equity firms, investment banks and debt financing sources that will be called upon to assist us in executing our strategy. 

&#160;

We have assembled a group of independent directors who bring us public company governance, executive leadership, operations oversight, private equity investment management and capital markets experience. Our Board members have extensive experience, having served as directors, CEOs, CFOs or in other executive and advisory capacities for numerous publicly-listed and privately-owned companies. Our directors have experience with acquisitions, divestitures and corporate strategy and implementation, which we believe will be of significant benefit to us as we evaluate potential acquisition or merger candidates as well as following the completion of our initial business combination. 

&#160;

Our entire management team served as executive officers, directors and/or advisors of Hennessy 1, a former blank check company which raised $115.0 million in its initial public offering in January 2014 and completed its initial business combination with SBH in February 2015. In connection with their duties with Hennessy 1, our executive officers reviewed more than one hundred potential targets in the diversified industrial manufacturing and distribution sectors in the United States between February 2014 (a month following Hennessy 1&#8217;s initial public offering) and June 2014 (when Hennessy 1 decided to focus its efforts on a business combination with SBH). Hennessy 1&#8217;s stockholders approved the business combination with SBH with approximately 99% of the shares voting, 98% of which were voted in favor of the transaction, allowing for the swift completion of the business combination only 13 months after Hennessy 1&#8217;s initial public offering. The purchase price for the transaction reflected a pro forma enterprise value of $427 million which implied a purchase multiple of 5.7x to 5.9x FY2015 estimated EBITDA based on SBH&#8217;s management&#8217;s guidance versus the average of the public comparables of 9.3x EBITDA. The transaction included the assumption of $223 million of debt which implied 2.5x net leverage at closing (based on FY2014 adjusted EBITDA). We believe that potential sellers of target businesses will view the fact that our management team has successfully closed a business combination with a vehicle similar to our company as a positive factor in considering whether or not to enter into a business combination with us. However, past performance by our management team is not a guarantee of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. 

&#160;

We believe our management team is well positioned to take advantage of the growing set of investment opportunities focused on industrial manufacturing, distribution or service companies in the United States, to create value for our stockholders, and that our contacts and relationships, ranging from owners of private and public companies, private equity funds, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and business brokers will allow us to generate attractive acquisition opportunities. Our management team is led by Daniel J. Hennessy, who has over 25 years of experience in the private equity investment business and served as Chief Executive Officer of Hennessy 1. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that Mr. Hennessy or any other members of our management will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process, but our business is currently Mr. Hennessy&#8217;s primary professional focus and we expect that he will continue to devote a substantial portion of his professional time to our affairs. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Strategy and Execution 

&#160; 

We have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. 

&#160;

&#160; &#10148; Middle-Market Businesses. undefinedWe are seeking to acquire one or more businesses with an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $500 million to $1 billion and an EBITDA of $50 million to over $100 million, determined in the sole discretion of our officers and directors according to reasonably accepted valuation standards and methodologies. We believe that the middle market segment provides the greatest number of opportunities for investment and is the market consistent with our sponsor&#8217;s previous investment history. This segment is where we believe we have the strongest network to identify the greatest number of attractive opportunities. We are targeting more sizable businesses than Hennessy 1 as we believe the larger market capitalization and public float of the resulting company will be more attractive to our investors. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; Established Companies with Proven Track Records. undefinedWe are seeking to acquire one or more established companies with consistent historical financial performance. We are focused on companies with a history of strong operating and financial results and strong fundamentals. We do not intend to acquire start-up companies or companies with recurring negative free cash flow. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; Companies with Proven Revenue and Earnings Growth or Potential for Revenue and Earnings Growth. undefinedWe are seeking to acquire one or more businesses that have achieved or have the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through a combination of organic growth, synergistic add-on acquisitions, new product markets and geographies, increased production capacity, expense reduction and increased operating leverage. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; Companies with, or with the Potential for, Strong Free Cash Flow Generation. undefinedWe are seeking to acquire one or more businesses that already have, or have the potential to generate, consistent, stable and increasing free cash flow. We are focused on one or more businesses that have predictable revenue streams. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; Strong Competitive Position. undefinedWe are focused on acquisition targets that have a leading, growing or niche market position in their respective industries. We are analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of target businesses relative to their competitors. We are seeking to acquire one or more businesses that demonstrate advantages when compared to their competitors, which may help to protect their market position and profitability. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; Experienced Management Team. undefinedWe are seeking to acquire one or more businesses with a complete, experienced management team that provides a platform for us to further develop the acquired business&#8217;s management capabilities. We will seek to partner with a potential target&#8217;s management team and expect that the operating and financial abilities of our executive team and board will complement their own capabilities. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; Sectors Exhibiting Secular Growth or with Potential for Cyclical Uptick. undefinedWe are focused on acquisition targets in sectors which exhibit positive secular growth or potential for near-term cyclical uptick. We plan to identify sectors that have demonstrated strong positive growth in recent years, possess drivers for continued growth and are strategically positioned to benefit from upswings in their respective industry cycles. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; Benefit from Being a Public Company. undefinedWe intend to acquire one or more businesses that will benefit from being publicly traded and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company. &#160;

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. These criteria are substantially similar to the criteria set forth by Hennessy 1 for its initial business combination. Hennessy 1&#8217;s business combination with School Bus Holdings Inc., which, through its subsidiaries, conducts its business under the &#8220;Blue Bird&#8221; name, and satisfied each criteria. 

&#160;

In addition, the members of our board of directors have significant executive management and public company experience with industrial manufacturing, distribution or service companies. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and board of directors have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will be useful for sourcing investment opportunities. This network has been developed through our management team&#8217;s experience in: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#10148; sourcing, acquiring, operating, developing, growing, financing and selling businesses; and &#160; 

&#160; &#10148; executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. &#160; 

This network has provided our management team with a flow of referrals that have resulted in numerous transactions. We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with an important source of investment opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banks, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. In connection with their duties with Hennessy 1, our executive officers reviewed more than one hundred potential targets in the diversified industrial manufacturing and distribution sectors in the United States between February 2014 (a month following Hennessy 1&#8217;s initial public offering) and June 2014 (when Hennessy 1 decided to focus its efforts on a business combination with SBH). 

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us. 

&#160;

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a qualified independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 

&#160;

Members of our management team directly or indirectly own our common stock and warrants following our initial public offering, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. For additional information regarding our executive officers&#8217; and directors&#8217; business affiliations, see &#8220;Management&#8212;Directors and Executive Officers.&#8221; 

&#160;

Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our executive officers will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. 

&#160;

Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination by July 28, 2017, which is 24 months after the closing of our initial public offering. 

&#160; 

Significant Activities Since Inception 

&#160; 

On July 28, 2015, we consummated our initial public offering of 17,500,000 units, each unit consisting of one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and one warrant to purchase one-half of one share of common stock at an exercise price of $5.75 per half share ($11.50 per full share), pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-205152). The units were sold in our initial public offering at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $175,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we completed the private placement of 13,900,000 warrants, issued to our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $6,950,000. 

&#160; 

On July 30, 2015, the underwriters of our initial public offering exercised their over-allotment option in part and, on August 4, 2015, the underwriters purchased 2,459,908 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of approximately $25 million. On August 4, 2015, simultaneously with the sale of the over-allotment units, the Company completed a private placement with our sponsor for an additional 1,180,756 warrants at a price of $0.50 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of approximately $590,000. 

&#160; 

Approximately $200 million of the net proceeds from the IPO (including the over-allotment) and the private placements with our sponsor were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company&#8217;s public stockholders. 

&#160; 

Our units began trading on July 23, 2015 on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol HCACU. Commencing on September 11, 2015, the securities comprising the units began separate trading. The units, common stock, and warrants are trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols &#8220;HCACU,&#8221; &#8220;HCAC&#8221; and &#8220;HCACW,&#8221; respectively. 

&#160; 

Initial Business Combination 

&#160; 

NASDAQ rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. 

&#160; 

Status as a Public Company 

&#160; 

We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this process a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters&#8217; ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders&#8217; interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company&#8217;s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 

&#160; 

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. 

&#160; 

Financial Position 

&#160; 

With funds available for a business combination currently in the amount of $194,276,000 (including amounts held outside the trust account at December 31, 2015) assuming no redemptions and after payment of $7,185,000 of deferred underwriting fees, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 

&#160;

Effecting our Initial Business Combination 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 

&#160;

Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. 

&#160;

We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. 

&#160;

Origination and Sourcing of Target Business Opportunities 

&#160;

We believe our management team&#8217;s extensive private equity investment and transaction experience, along with relationships with intermediaries and companies, will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our board and management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has been developed over the course of over 25 years, in the case of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 

&#160;

Specifically, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer serves as a Partner at CHS Capital, a middle-market private equity investment firm he co-founded in 1988. Over a 25-year period, CHS invested $2.8 billion in 395 operating companies with aggregate revenues of approximately $15 billion. From September 2013 to February 2015, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as well as certain of our directors and officers served as directors of Hennessy 1, formerly a blank check company, which is now Blue Bird Corporation (NASDAQ: BLBD). We expect that the management team&#8217;s network of existing contacts and relationships will be able to deliver a flow of potential platform and add-on acquisition opportunities which are proprietary or where a limited group of established, credentialed buyers have been invited to participate in the sale process. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions. Our executive officers were able to review more than one hundred potential targets for Hennessy 1 between February 2014 (a month following Hennessy 1&#8217;s initial public offering) and June 2014 (when Hennessy 1 decided to focus its efforts on a business combination with SBH). 

&#160;

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, executive officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking which is a member of FINRA or a qualified independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 

&#160;

If any of our executive officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. All of our executive officers currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. 

&#160;

We anticipate that target business candidates will also be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, private investment funds and other intermediaries. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus relating to our initial public offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of our officers and directors. 

&#160;

&#160;

Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination 

&#160;

NASDAQ rules provide that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or a qualified independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. If our securities are not listed on NASDAQ after our initial public offering, we would not be required to satisfy the 80% requirement. However, we intend to satisfy the 80% requirement even if our securities are not listed on NASDAQ at the time of our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management has virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we are not permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 

&#160;

In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. 

&#160;

To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 

&#160;

In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us. 

&#160;

The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 

&#160;

Lack of business diversification 

&#160;

For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#10148; subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and &#160; 

&#160; &#10148; cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. &#160; 

Limited ability to evaluate the target&#8217;s management team 

&#160;

Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business&#8217;s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 

&#160;

We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 

&#160;

Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that the additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

&#160;

Stockholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination 

&#160;

We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction. 

&#160;

Type of Transaction &#160; Whether Stockholder Approval is Required Purchase of assets &#160; No Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company &#160; No Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company &#160; No Merger of the company with a target &#160; Yes &#160;

Under NASDAQ&#8217;s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 

&#160;

&#160; &#10148; we issue common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by NASDAQ rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding shares of common stock or voting power of 5% or more; or &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control. &#160;

Permitted purchases of our securities 

&#160;

In the event we seek stockholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy which requires insiders to: refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information and to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary. 

&#160;

In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. 

&#160;

The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 

&#160;

In addition, if such purchases are made, the public &#8220;float&#8221; of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 

&#160;

Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against the business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. 

&#160;

Redemption rights for public stockholders upon completion of our initial business combination 

&#160;

We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and working capital released to us) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be approximately $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our business combination. 

&#160;

Manner of Conducting Redemptions 

&#160;

We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. 

&#160;

If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 

&#160;

&#160; &#10148; conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. &#160;

Upon the public announcement of our business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 

&#160;

In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to purchase will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination. 

&#160;

If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#10148; conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; file proxy materials with the SEC. &#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 

&#160;

If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, we would need only 7,484,966 of the 19,959,908 public shares, or 37.5%, sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of our initial business combination in order to have such transaction approved. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of a business combination. 

&#160;

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 

&#160;

Limitation on redemption upon completion of our initial business combination if we seek stockholder approval 

&#160;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a &#8220;group&#8221; (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as the &#8220;Excess Shares.&#8221; We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder&#8217;s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders&#8217; ability to redeem no more than 20% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders&#8217; ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination. 

&#160;

Tendering stock certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights 

&#160;

We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in &#8220;street name,&#8221; to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company&#8217;s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder&#8217;s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 

&#160;

There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $35.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders&#8217; vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an &#8220;option window&#8221; after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company&#8217;s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become &#8220;option&#8221; rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder&#8217;s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 

&#160;

Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholders meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our business combination. 

&#160;

If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 

&#160;

If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until July 28, 2017. 

&#160;

Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination 

&#160;

Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed that if we do not complete our initial business combination by July 28, 2017, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and working capital released to us) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&#8217; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the 24-month time period. 

&#160;

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by July 28, 2017. However, if our initial stockholders acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 24-month time period. 

&#160;

Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by July 28, 2017, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and working capital released to us) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules). Prior to acquiring any securities from our initial stockholders, permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement with us agreeing to be bound by the same restriction. 

&#160;

We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $2,004,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account (as of December 31, 2015), although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes and not released to us to fund working capital expenses, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $50,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors&#8217; claims. 

&#160;

Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party&#8217;s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, Mr. Hennessy has agreed that he will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes or working capital expenses, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then Mr. Hennessy will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We cannot assure you, however, that Mr. Hennessy would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 

&#160;

In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes or working capital expenses, and Mr. Hennessy asserts that he is unable to satisfy his indemnification obligations or that he has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against Mr. Hennessy to enforce his indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against Mr. Hennessy to enforce his indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.00 per share. 

&#160;

We will seek to reduce the possibility that Mr. Hennessy will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Mr. Hennessy will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately $2,004,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account (as of December 31, 2015) with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $50,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.

Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination by July 28, 2017 may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. Delaware law provides that if a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&#8217;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 

&#160;

Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination by July 28, 2017, is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete our business combination by July 28, 2017, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes or working capital expenses and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&#8217; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 24th month, and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 

&#160;

Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers and investment bankers) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. 

&#160;

As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, Mr. Hennessy may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes or working capital expenses and less any per-share amounts distributed from our trust account to our public stockholders in the event we are unable to complete our business combination by July 28, 2017 and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Mr. Hennessy will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. 

&#160;

If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a &#8220;preferential transfer&#8221; or a &#8220;fraudulent conveyance.&#8221; As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 

&#160;

Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our business combination by July 28, 2017 or if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder&#8217;s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder&#8217;s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation 

&#160;

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders&#8217; rights or pre-business combination activity, we will provide public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that: 

&#160;

&#160; &#10148; prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and working capital released to us) or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and working capital released to us) in each case subject to the limitations described herein; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; if our initial business combination is not consummated by July 28, 2017, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#10148; prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination. &#160;

These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may consummate our initial business combination only if approved by a majority of the shares of common stock voted by our stockholders at a duly held stockholders meeting. &#160; 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we have encountered, and may continue to encounter, intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We currently have three executive officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that Mr. Hennessy or any other members of our management will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process, but our business is currently Mr. Hennessy&#8217;s primary professional focus and we expect that he will continue to devote a substantial portion of his professional time to our affairs. 

&#160; &#160; 

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 

&#160; 

Our units, common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors. 

&#160; 

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with GAAP. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 

&#160; 

We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 

&#160; 

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 

&#160; 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

&#160; 

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30 th , and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
