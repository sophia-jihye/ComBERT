Description of Business 

We are one of the leaders in the motion picture exhibition industry. As of December 31, 2015, we operated 513 theatres and 5,796 screens in the U.S. and Latin America and approximately 280 million patrons attended our theatres worldwide during the year ended December 31, 2015. We are one of the most geographically diverse worldwide exhibitors, with theatres in fifteen countries as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, our U.S. circuit had 337 theatres and 4,518 screens in 41 states and our international circuit had 176 theatres and 1,278 screens. 

Revenues, operating income and net income attributable to Cinemark Holdings, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $2,852.6 million, $423.2 million and $216.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents of $588.5 million and total long-term debt of $1,814.6 million. Approximately $579.0 million, or 32%, of our long-term debt accrues interest at variable rates and approximately $8.4 million of our long-term debt matures in 2016. 

We selectively build or acquire new theatres in markets where we can establish and maintain a strong market position. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we built 22 new theatres with 182 screens and acquired three theatres with 19 screens. 

We believe our portfolio of modern high-quality theatres with multiple platforms provides a preferred destination for moviegoers and contributes to our solid and consistent cash flows from operating activities. Our significant and diverse presence in the U.S. and Latin America has made us an important distribution channel for movie studios, particularly considering the expanding worldwide box office. 

We continue to develop and expand new platforms and market adaptive concepts for our theatre circuit, such as XD, Movie Bistro, Cinemark Reserve, Luxury Lounger reclining seats, D-BOX seating, Cin&#232;Arts and other premium concepts. 

Our XD screens represent the largest private label premium large format footprint in the industry. Our XD auditorium offers a premium experience utilizing the latest in digital projection and enhanced custom sound, 

&#160; 

including a Barco Auro 11.1 sound system or Dolby Atmos in select locations. The XD experience includes wall-to-wall and ceiling-to-floor screens, wrap-around sound, plush seating and a maximum comfort entertainment environment for an immersive experience. The exceptional XD technology does not require special format movie prints, which allows us the flexibility to play any available digital print we choose, including 3-D content, in the XD auditorium without any print enhancements required. As of December 31, 2015, we had 210 XD auditoriums in our worldwide circuit with plans to install 15 to 20 more XD auditoriums during 2016. 

The Movie Bistro locations offer in-theatre dining with expanded food offerings, such as fresh wraps, hot sandwiches, burgers, and gourmet pizzas, and a selection of beers, wines, and frozen cocktails, all of which can be enjoyed in the comfort of the auditoriums. We currently have three domestic theatres and one international theatre with the bistro concept and we plan to expand this premium concept to two new domestic locations during 2016. 

During 2014, we opened our first Cinemark Reserve theatre in the U.S., which features a VIP area with luxury recliner seating and other amenities, along with a wide variety of food and beverage products. We opened our second Cinemark Reserve theatre in the U.S. during 2015. We have a similar VIP concept offering recliner seating in five other domestic locations and in 22 of our international theatres, referred to locally as either Cinemark Premiere or Cinemark Prime. We plan to continue to incorporate this concept in four of our new domestic and international theatres and convert three of our existing locations during 2016. 

We have incorporated Luxury Lounger reclining seats in the majority of our new domestic builds and have also repositioned some of our existing domestic theatres to offer this premium seating feature. We currently feature Luxury Loungers in 29 of our domestic theatres, representing 397 screens. We plan to offer the Luxury Loungers in approximately 20% of our domestic circuit by the end of 2016. 

We currently have auditoriums throughout our worldwide circuit that offer seats with immersive cinematic motion, called D-BOX. These seats are programmed in harmony with the audio and video content of the film and makes the viewer feel as if they are part of the movie itself. We offer D-BOX seating in 96 auditoriums throughout our worldwide circuit. We expect to add D-BOX seating to 40 locations during 2016. 

Our Cin&#232;Arts locations provide moviegoers with the best selection of art and independent cinema in a captivating, unique environment and has set the industry standard for providing distinct, acclaimed and award-winning films. We currently have 14 domestic theatres that are dedicated to art and independent content and 57 of our other domestic theatres also offer art and independent films on a limited basis. 

Motion Picture Exhibition Industry Overview 

Technology Platform 

The motion picture exhibition industry began its conversion to digital projection technology during 2009. Digital projection technology allows filmmakers the ability to showcase imaginative works of art exactly as they were intended, with incredible realism and detail. A digitally produced or digitally converted movie can be distributed to theatres via satellite, physical media, or fiber optic networks. The digitized movie is stored on a computer/server which &#147;serves&#148; it to a digital projector for each screening of the movie. This format enables us to more efficiently move titles between auditoriums within a theatre to appropriately address demand for each title. 

Currently, all of our first-run domestic and international theatres are fully digital. Digital projection allows us to present 3-D content and alternative entertainment such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, gaming events and other special presentations. Three-dimensional technology offers a premium experience with crisp, bright, ultra-realistic images. According to Motion Picture Association of America, or MPAA, approximately 17% and 13% of domestic box office for 2013 and 2014, respectively, was generated by 3-D tickets. 

&#160; 

During 2013, through a joint venture named Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition, or DCDC, the motion picture exhibition industry developed a content delivery network that allows for delivery of all digital content to U.S. theatres via satellite. Delivery of content via satellite reduces film transportation costs for both distributors and exhibitors, as a portion of the costs to produce and ship hard drives has been eliminated. 

We have started to expand satellite delivery technology into some of our Latin American markets, initially for live event presentations. Approximately 59 of our international theatres have capabilities to receive live event feeds via satellite, with some of these locations also able to receive film content via satellite. 

Domestic Markets 

The U.S. motion picture exhibition industry set an all-time box office record during 2015 with an estimated $11.1 billion in revenues. This represents an increase of approximately 7% over 2014 and an increase of 2% over box office revenues for the previous record set during 2013. The following table represents the results of a survey by MPAA published during March 2015, outlining the historical trends in U.S. box office performance for the ten year period from 2005 to 2014 (industry data for 2015 has not yet been released):

&#160; $10.4 &#160; 1.27 &#160; $8.17 Films leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2015 included Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Jurassic World , Avengers: Age of Ultron , Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part II, Furious 7, American Sniper, 50 Shades of Grey , Inside Out , Minions , Spectre and Mission: Impossible 5, among other films. 

Films scheduled for release during 2016 include well-known franchise films such as Captain America: Civil War , Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice , Finding Dory , Star Trek Beyond, and X-Men: Apocalypse ; action films such as Deadpool ; family films such as The Secret Life Of Pets , Zootopia, Alice Through The Looking Glass , and Sing ; and spin-off films such as Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and the Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them , among other films. 

International Markets 

According to MPAA, international box office revenues were $26.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing a 4% increase over 2013. International box office growth is a result of strong economies, ticket price increases and new theatre construction. According to MPAA, Latin American box office revenues were $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, consistent with 2013 performance. 

Growth in Latin America continues to be fueled by a combination of growing populations, attractive demographics (i.e., a significant teenage population), continued retail development, and quality product from Hollywood, including 3-D and alternative content offerings. In many Latin American countries, including Brazil, 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Chile, successful local film product can also provide incremental box office growth opportunities. 

We believe many international markets will continue to experience growth as new theatre technologies and platforms are introduced, as film and other product offerings continue to expand and as ancillary revenue opportunities grow. 

Drivers of Continued Industry Success 

We believe the following market trends will drive the continued strength of our industry: 

Importance of Theatrical Success in Establishing Movie Brands. Theatrical exhibition has long been the primary distribution channel for new motion picture releases. A successful theatrical release &#147;brands&#148; a film and is one of the major contributors to a film&#146;s success in &#147;downstream&#148; markets, such as digital downloads, video on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs, and network and syndicated television. 

Increased Importance of International Markets for Box Office Success . International markets continue to be an increasingly important component of the overall box office revenues generated by Hollywood films, accounting for $26.0 billion, or approximately 72%, of 2014 total worldwide box office revenues according to MPAA. (As of the date of this report, 2015 industry data was not yet available.) With the continued growth of the international motion picture exhibition industry, we believe the relative contribution of markets outside North America will become even more significant. Many of the top U.S. films released during 2015 also performed exceptionally well in international markets. Such films included Furious 7 , which grossed approximately $1,162.0 million in international markets, or approximately 77% of its worldwide box office, Avengers: Age of Ultron , which grossed approximately $946.0 million in international markets, or approximately 67% of its worldwide box office, and Jurassic World , which grossed approximately $1,014.0 million in international markets, or approximately 61% of its worldwide box office. 

Stable Box Office Levels. Over the past ten years, industry statistics have shown slight increases and decreases in attendance from one year to another, however domestic box office revenues have remained relatively stable during this period. The industry has not experienced highly volatile results, even during recessionary periods, demonstrating the stability of the industry and its continued ability to attract consumers. 

Convenient and Affordable Form of Out-Of-Home Entertainment. Movie going continues to be one of the most convenient and affordable forms of out-of-home entertainment, with an estimated average ticket price in the U.S. of $8.17 in 2014. Average prices in 2014 for other forms of out-of-home entertainment in the U.S., including sporting events and theme parks, ranged from approximately $28.00 to $84.00 per ticket according to MPAA. (As of the date of this report, 2015 industry data was not available.) 

Innovation Using Digital and Satellite Technology. Our industry began converting to digital projection technology during 2009. Our domestic circuit also converted to satellite technology during 2014 and our international circuit has started to implement satellite technology as a means to receive film and other content. Digital projection combined with satellite delivery allows exhibitors to expand their product offerings, including the presentation of 3-D content and alternative entertainment. Alternative entertainment may include pre-recorded programs as well as live sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, e-sports gaming events and other special presentations. New and enhanced programming alternatives expands the industry&#146;s offerings to attract a broader customer base. 

Introduction of New Platforms and Product Offerings. The motion picture exhibition industry continues to develop new movie theatre platforms and concepts to respond to varying and changing consumer preferences. In addition to changing the overall style of, and amenities offered in some theatres, concession product offerings 

&#160; 

have continued to expand to more than just traditional popcorn and candy items. Some locations now offer hot foods, adult beverages and/or healthier snack options for patrons. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe the following strengths allow us to compete effectively: 

Experienced Management. Led by Chairman and founder Lee Roy Mitchell, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zoradi, Chief Financial Officer Sean Gamble, President and Chief Operating Officer Robert Copple and President-International Valmir Fernandes, our operational management team has many years of industry experience. Each of our international offices is led by general managers that are local citizens familiar with cultural, political and economic factors impacting each country. Our worldwide management team has successfully navigated us through many industry and economic cycles. 

Disciplined Operating Philosophy. We generated operating income and net income attributable to Cinemark Holdings, Inc. of $423.2 million and $216.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our solid operating performance is a result of our disciplined operating philosophy that centers on building high-quality theatres, while maintaining favorable theatre-level economics, controlling operating costs and effectively reacting to economic and market changes. 

Leading Position in Our U.S. Markets. We have a leading market share in most of the U.S. markets we serve, which includes a presence in 41 states. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we ranked either first or second, based on box office revenues, in 22 out of our top 30 U.S. markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area, Dallas, Houston, Salt Lake City, Sacramento, Cleveland and Austin. 

Located in Top Latin American Markets. We have continued to invest throughout Latin America. As of December 31, 2015, we operated 176 theatres and 1,278 screens in 14 countries. Our international screens generated revenues of $728.7 million, or 25.5% of our total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2015. We have successfully established a significant presence in major cities in the region, with theatres in thirteen of the fifteen largest metropolitan areas in South America. We are the largest exhibitor in Brazil and Argentina. Our geographic diversity makes us an important distribution channel for the movie studios. 

State-of-the-Art Theatre Circuit. We offer state-of-the-art theatres, which we believe makes our theatres a preferred destination for moviegoers in our markets. During 2015, we built 182 new screens worldwide. We currently have commitments to open 184 additional new screens over the next three years. We have installed digital projection technology in all of our worldwide auditoriums. Currently, approximately 55% of our U.S. screens and 65% of our international screens are 3-D compatible. We currently have 14 digital IMAX screens. As of December 31, 2015, we had the industry-leading private label premium large format circuit with 210 XD auditoriums in our theatres. We have plans to install 15 to 20 additional XD auditoriums during 2016. We also continue to develop new market-adaptive theatre concepts in various markets. We believe we offer the brightest picture in the industry, with our Doremi servers and Barco digital projectors, and custom surround sound in our auditoriums. We have also established a centralized theatre support center that monitors and responds to projection performance and theatre network connectivity issues across our worldwide circuit on real-time basis. 

Disciplined and Targeted Growth Strategy. We continue to grow organically as well as through the acquisition of high-quality theatres in select markets. Our growth strategy has centered around achieving a target return on investment while also complementing our existing theatre circuit. We continue to generate significant cash flows from operating activities, which demonstrates the success of our growth strategy. We believe a combination of our strong balance sheet and our expected level of cash flows will continue to provide us with the financial flexibility to pursue further growth opportunities, while also allowing us to efficiently service our debt obligations and continue to offer our stockholders a strong dividend yield under our current dividend policy. 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

We believe our disciplined operating philosophy and experienced operational management team will enable us to continue to enhance our leading position in the motion picture exhibition industry. Key components of our strategy include: 

Focus on Operational Excellence and Customer Satisfaction. We continue to focus on achieving operational excellence by controlling theatre operating costs and training and motivating our staff all while focusing on making each of our customer&#146;s experiences memorable. We strive for first-rate customer service and focus on driving attendance. Our consistent industry-leading margins reflect our ability to deliver the highest quality presentation to our patrons while also managing changes in product and consumer preferences. 

Growth in Existing and New Markets. We continue to seek growth opportunities by building or acquiring high-quality theatres that meet our strategic, financial and demographic criteria. We added 25 new theatres with 201 screens to our worldwide circuit during the year ended December 31, 2015. We also monitor economic and market trends to ensure our existing theatres offer a broad range of products, prices and platforms that satisfy our patrons and to develop new concepts to adapt to changes in preferences. During 2014, we acquired one theatre in Alabama, a new state for us and we opened our first theatre in Bolivia. During 2015, we opened our first theatre in Curacao, adding another new country to our diverse circuit. We have plans to open a theatre in Paraguay, another new country, in 2016. 

Commitment to Technological and Product Innovation. Our commitment to technological innovation has resulted in us being 100% digital in our worldwide circuit as of December 31, 2015. In the U.S., 100% of our projectors are networked with satellite infrastructure and our Latin American theatres will be 100% capable by the end of 2016. We continue to expand our worldwide XD auditorium footprint. We are also committed to developing and expanding our new market-adaptive theatres. With our technological innovations, we have broadened the range of entertainment options offered at our theatres by expanding content to include concert events, e-sports gaming events and other special presentations. Approximately 57% of our worldwide screens are 3-D compatible. We are also committed to developing and expanding our market-adaptive concepts. Our concession and food offerings are progressing to selectively include upscale options, hot prepared food, offerings tailored to local demographics, alcoholic beverages, and healthy snack alternatives in addition to our more standard concession products. Theatre amenities we provide to our customers may include our private-label premium large format XD screens, Luxury Lounger reclining seats, VIP lounge areas, reserved seating, and seats with cinematic motion. 

Sustained Investment in Existing Circuit. While we continue to grow our theatre circuit with new builds and acquisitions, we also remain committed to investing in our existing theatres to ensure they provide our customers with a comfortable, high-quality entertainment experience. We spent approximately $140 million and $199 million on capital expenditures for existing theatres during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Our efforts during 2015 included remodeling some of our existing theatres to include reclining seats and expanded concession offerings, the purchase of our corporate headquarters building in Plano, TX and routine improvements to ensure our theatres offer the highest quality guest experience. 

&#160;

(1) &#160; Includes Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala and Curacao. 

We first entered Latin America when we opened a theatre in Chile in 1993. Since then, through our focused international growth strategy, we have developed the most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the region. We have balanced our risk through a diversified international portfolio, which includes theatres in thirteen of the fifteen largest metropolitan areas in South America. We have established significant presence in Brazil and Argentina, where we are the largest exhibitor, with 568 and 179 screens, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. 

We believe that certain markets within Latin America continue to be underserved as penetration of movie screens per capita in these markets is substantially lower than in the U.S. and European markets. We intend to continue to build and expand our presence in international markets, with emphasis on Latin America, and fund our expansion primarily with cash flow generated in those markets. We are able to mitigate cash flow exposure to currency fluctuations by transacting local operating expenses primarily in their respective local currencies. Our geographic diversity throughout Latin America has allowed us to maintain consistent local currency revenue growth, notwithstanding currency and economic fluctuations that may affect any particular market. 

Content and Film Licensing 

We offer a variety of content at our theatres. We monitor upcoming films and related events and work with film distributors to license the content that we believe will be most successful in our theatres. We play mainstream films from many different genres, such as animated films, family films, dramas, comedies, horror and action films. We offer content in both 2-D and 3-D formats in all of our theatres, and in select locations, we also offer a D-BOX format. The D-BOX format features moving seats and added sensory features in addition to the ultra-realistic images of 3-D technology. 

We also regularly play art and independent films at many of our U.S. theatres and offer local film product in our international markets, providing a variety of film choices to our patrons. Bringing art and independent films to our theatres allows us to benefit from the growth in the art and independent market driven by the increased interest in art, foreign and documentary films. 

We have also established a Classic Series at a majority of our U.S. theatres and some of our international theatres, which involves playing digitally re-mastered classic movies that change on a weekly basis. The program covers many genres of classic films that are generally exhibited during non-peak times. 

During December 2013, we formed a joint venture, named AC JV, LLC, with Regal Entertainment Group, or Regal, and AMC Entertainment, Inc., or AMC, which then purchased the Fathom event business from National CineMedia, LLC. The Fathom event business generally focuses on the marketing and distribution of live and pre-recorded entertainment programming to movie theatres to augment theatres&#146; feature film schedules. 

&#160; 

AC JV, LLC will continue to bring alternative events to our theatres, including the Metropolitan Opera, sports programs, concert events, e-sports gaming events and other special presentations, that may be live or pre-recorded. We, along with AC JV, LLC, continue to identify new ways to utilize our theatre platform to provide entertainment to consumers. 

In the domestic marketplace, our corporate film department negotiates with film distributors to license films for each of our domestic theatres. The film distributors are responsible for determining film release dates and film marketing campaigns and the related expenditures. We are responsible for booking the films in film licensing zones, which are either free film licensing zones or competitive film licensing zones. In free film licensing zones, movies can be booked without regard to the film bookings of other exhibitors within that area. In competitive film licensing zones, the distributor allocates its movies generally based on demographics, the conditions, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and the terms of exhibition. We are generally able to book films without regard to the film bookings of other exhibitors at approximately 93% of our domestic theatres. We face competition from other exhibitors and other forms of entertainment, as discussed under Competition below, in both our free and competitive film licensing zones. 

In each of our international offices, our local film personnel negotiate with local offices of major film distributors as well as local film distributors to license films for our international theatres. In the international marketplace, films are not allocated based on film licensing zones, but played by competitive theatres simultaneously. Our theatre personnel focus on providing excellent customer service, and we provide a high-quality facility with the most up-to-date sound systems, comfortable seating and other amenities preferred by our patrons, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in markets where competing theatres play the same films. 

In both our domestic and international locations, we pay film rental fees based on a film&#146;s box office receipts at each of our theatres. Film rental rates are negotiated based on either a firm terms formula under which we pay a negotiated rate as determined prior to a film&#146;s run; a sliding scale formula under which the rate is based on a standard rate matrix that is established prior to a film&#146;s run; or a rate that is negotiated after a film&#146;s run. 

Food and Beverage 

Concession sales are our second largest revenue source, representing approximately 33% of total revenues. Concession sales have a much higher margin than admissions sales. We have devoted considerable management effort to increasing concession sales by expanding our offerings and adapting to our customers&#146; changing preferences, as discussed below. 

Concession Product Mix. Common concession products offered at all of our theatres include various sizes and types of popcorn, soft drinks, coffees, juice blends, candy and quickly-prepared or pre-prepared food, such as hot dogs, pizza, pretzel bites, nachos and ice cream. Other varieties and flavors of candy, snacks and drinks are offered at theatres based on preferences in that particular market. We have recently introduced some healthier snack and beverage options for our patrons, which are available at some locations, and also offer a variety of alcoholic beverages in some locations. 

Through our Movie Bistro, Cinemark Reserve and Cinemark Premier concepts, we have expanded concession product offerings to include more food and drink options, such as fresh wraps, hot sandwiches, burgers, and gourmet pizzas, and a selection of beers, wines, and frozen cocktails, all of which can be enjoyed in the comfort of the auditoriums. We also have lobby bars and VIP lounges in certain domestic and international theatres. 

Our point of sale system allows us to monitor product sales and make changes to product mix when necessary, which also allows us to quickly take advantage of national as well as regional product launches and promotions. 

Pricing. New products and promotions are introduced on a regular basis to increase concession purchases as well as to attract new buyers. We offer specially-priced product combinations at many of our theatres. We 

&#160; 

periodically offer discounts to our patrons on certain products by offering weekly coupons as well as reusable popcorn tubs and soft drink cups that can be refilled at a discounted price. In certain international countries, we offer a loyalty benefit program to frequent patrons. 

Staff Training. Employees are continually trained in proper sales techniques. Consumer promotions usually include a motivational element that rewards theatre staff for exceptional sales of certain promotional items. 

Theatre Design. Our theatres are designed to optimize efficiencies at the concession stands, which include multiple service stations throughout a theatre to facilitate serving patrons in an expedited manner. We strategically place large concession stands within theatres to heighten visibility, reduce the length of concession lines, and improve traffic flow around the concession stands. We have self-service cafeteria-style concession areas in many of our domestic theatres, which allow customers to select their own refreshments and proceed to the cash register when they are ready. This design allows for efficient service, enhanced choices, impulse purchases and superior visibility of concession items. In some of our international locations, we allow patrons to pre-order concession items, either online or at a kiosk, and pick them up in a dedicated line at the concession counter. 

Cost Control. We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume discounts and negotiate rebates. Concession supplies are generally distributed through a distribution network. The concession distributor delivers inventory to the theatres, which place orders directly with the vendors to replenish stock. We conduct a weekly inventory of concession products at every theatre to ensure proper stock levels are maintained to appropriately serve our customers. 

Pre-Feature Screen Advertising 

In our domestic markets, our theatres are part of the in-theatre digital network operated by National CineMedia, LLC, or NCM. NCM provides advertising to our theatres through its branded &#147; First Look &#148; pre-feature entertainment program and also handles lobby promotions and displays for our theatres. We believe that the reach, scope and digital delivery capability of NCM&#146;s network provides an effective platform for national, regional and local advertisers to reach an engaged audience. We receive a monthly theatre access fee for participation in the NCM network and also earn screen advertising revenue on a per patron basis. As of December 31, 2015, we had an approximate 19% ownership interest in NCM. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investment in NCM. 

In our international markets, during 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary Flix Media Publicidade E Entretenimento, Ltda., or Flix Media, began handling all of our screen advertising functions in Brazil. Our Flix Media marketing personnel work with local agencies and advertisers to coordinate screen advertising in our Brazil theatres. We have expanded the Flix Media advertising services to another exhibitor in Brazil through a revenue share agreement. In Argentina, we also have in-house personnel that work with local advertisers to arrange screen advertising in our Argentina theatres. We recently acquired an advertising business in Chile, which we will also integrate with our Flix Media division. In our other international markets, we outsource our screen advertising to local companies who have established relationships with local advertisers that provide similar benefits as NCM. The terms of our international screen advertising contracts vary by country. In some of these locations, we earn a percentage of the screen advertising revenues collected by our partners and in other locations we are paid a fixed annual fee for access to our screens. We will continue to expand Flix Media into our other international locations over the next few years. In addition to screen advertising in our theatres, we intend to expand Flix Media&#146;s services to include, among other things, alternative content, online ticketing, and loyalty initiatives. 

Technology Innovations 

The motion picture exhibition industry has undertaken certain technology initiatives over the past few years, as discussed below. 

&#160; 

Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition 

Through the joint venture DCDC with Regal, AMC, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. and Universal Pictures, we began delivering digital content to domestic theatres via satellite during October 2013. As of December 31, 2015, 100% of our domestic auditoriums were capable of receiving content via satellite. Delivery of content via satellite reduces film transportation costs for both distributors and exhibitors, as a portion of the costs to produce and ship hard drives has been eliminated. The satellite delivery system established by DCDC is available to all exhibitors and content providers and allows live and store-and-forward content to be delivered to our theatres. 

Satellite Delivery - International 

The industry is beginning to expand satellite delivery technology to certain Latin American markets. Currently, 59 of our international theatres have the ability to receive live events via satellite, with some of these also able to receive film content via satellite. During 2016, we plan to install the necessary equipment in all of our international theatres to allow them to receive content via satellite. 

Marketing 

We generally market our theatres and events using Internet advertising and newspaper directory film schedules. Radio and television advertising spots are also used to promote certain motion pictures and special events, such as theatre grand openings and VIP events. We exhibit previews of coming attractions and current films as part of our on-screen pre-feature program. We offer patrons access to movie times, the ability to buy and print their tickets in advance and purchase gift cards at our website www.cinemark.com and via our smart phone and tablet applications. Customers can subscribe to our weekly emails to receive information about current and upcoming films at their preferred Cinemark theatre(s), including details about advanced ticket sales, screenings, special events, concerts and live broadcasts; as well as contests, promotions, and coupons for concession savings. We partner with film distributors on a regular basis to promote their films through local, regional and national programs that are exclusive to our theatres. These programs may involve customer contests, cross-promotions with the media and third parties and other means to increase patronage for a particular film showing at our theatres. 

CineMode, which is a function within the app we developed, allows patrons the opportunity to earn rewards while being courteous during a show. Our innovative technology was designed to address texting and other cell phone distractions, which is the number one complaint of movie-goers. While in CineMode, the phone&#146;s screen is automatically dimmed and patrons are prompted to silence their volume. If CineMode is enabled for the duration of the movie, patrons are rewarded with exclusive digital rewards and offers that can be used at their next visit to Cinemark. CineMode connects us with our patrons and provides an opportunity for us to further expand our relationships with the studios and our vendors through promotions. 

We also have loyalty programs in some of our international markets that allow customers to pay a nominal fee for a membership card that provides them with certain admissions and concession discounts. 

Our domestic and international marketing departments also focus on expanding ancillary revenue, which includes the sale of our gift cards and our SuperSaver discount tickets. We generally market these programs to businesses as an employee-incentive or rewards program. Our marketing departments also coordinate the use of our auditoriums, generally during off-peak times, for corporate meetings, private movie screenings, brand and product launches, education and training sessions or other private events, which contribute to our ancillary revenue. 

&#160; 

Competition 

We are one of the leaders in the motion picture exhibition industry. We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors with respect to attracting patrons, licensing films and developing new theatre sites. Our primary U.S. competitors include Regal, AMC and Carmike Cinemas, Inc. and our primary international competitors, which vary by country, include Cin&#233;polis, Cine Colombia, CinePlanet, Kinoplex (GSR), and Araujo. 

We are generally able to book films without regard to the film bookings of other exhibitors at approximately 93% of our theatres. In competitive film licensing zones, the distributor allocates its movies generally based on demographics, the conditions, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and the terms of exhibition. In all theatres, our success in attracting patrons depends on location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability, customer service quality, and ticket prices. 

We compete for new theatre sites with other movie theatre exhibitors as well as other entertainment venues. Securing a potential site depends upon factors such as committed investment and resources, theatre design and capacity, revenue and patron potential, and financial stability. 

We also face competition from a number of other motion picture exhibition delivery systems, such as digital downloads, video on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs, network and syndicated television. We also face competition from other forms of entertainment competing for the public&#146;s leisure time and disposable income, such as concerts, theme parks and sporting events. 

Seasonality 

Our revenues have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors. Generally, the most successful motion pictures have been released during the summer, extending from May to July, and during the holiday season, extending from early November through year-end. The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter this seasonality trend. The timing and quality of such film releases can have a significant impact on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year. 

Corporate Operations 

Our worldwide headquarters is located in Plano, Texas. Personnel at our corporate headquarters provide oversight and support for our domestic and international theatres, including our executive team and department heads in charge of film licensing, food and beverage, theatre operations, theatre construction and maintenance, real estate, human resources, marketing, legal, finance, accounting, tax, audit and information technology. Our U.S. operations are divided into nineteen regions, each of which is headed by a region leader. We have eight regional offices in Latin America responsible for the local management of theatres in fourteen countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala and Curacao are operated out of one Central American regional office). Each regional office is headed by a general manager with additional personnel responsible for film licensing, marketing, human resources, information technology, operations and accounting. We have chief financial officers in Brazil and Argentina, which are our two largest international markets. 

Employees 

We have approximately 19,300 employees in the U.S., approximately 19% of whom are full time employees and 81% of whom are part time employees. We have approximately 9,000 employees in our international markets, approximately 37% of whom are full time employees and approximately 63% of whom are part time employees. Due to the seasonal nature of our business as discussed above, our headcount can vary throughout the year, depending on the timing and success of movie releases. Some of our international locations are subject to union regulations. We regard our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. 

&#160; 

Regulations 

The distribution of motion pictures is largely regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases. The manner in which we can license films from certain major film distributors is subject to consent decrees resulting from these cases. Consent decrees bind certain major film distributors and require the films of such distributors to be offered and licensed to exhibitors, including Cinemark, on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis. Consequently, exhibitors cannot enter into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis. 

We are subject to various general regulations applicable to our operations including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, and regulations recently issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that require nutrition labels for certain menu items. Our theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship, health and sanitation requirements and various business licensing and permitting. 

Financial Information About Geographic Areas 

We currently have operations in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, and Curacao which are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for segment information and financial information by geographic area.
