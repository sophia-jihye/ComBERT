Recent Developments

Board of Directors

Effective as of June 19, 2016, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors appointed Messrs. Christopher Ho, Michael Binney and Kin Yuen as directors of the Company to fill vacancies created when five directors recently resigned following the completion of the Grande Restructuring Plan. See &#8220;&#8212;Controlling Shareholder&#8221; below. In connection with the director appointments, the Board of Directors also reduced the size of the full Board of Directors from seven to five directors. The Company believes that this restructured Board of Directors comprises an experienced group of executives with expertise and know-how regarding the consumer electronics industry and corporate finance that will help direct and grow the Company&#8217;s business operations. Mr. Ho serves as the Chairman of the Board, a position he formerly held through November 2013, and brings his extensive knowledge of the Company and experience in consumer electronics, international trade and corporate finance to the Board of Directors. Mr. Binney formerly served as a director of the Company from December 2005 to May 2008 and brings extensive public company accounting experience in addition to his knowledge of the Company to the Board of Directors. Mr. Yuen serves as a member of the Audit Committee and the Special Committee, and he brings extensive experience in corporate finance, financial planning, public company reporting and management to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors also appointed Kareem E. Sethi to the Special Committee effective as of June 19, 2016.

The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors formed the Special Committee as an ad hoc committee consisting solely of independent directors in March 2013 to evaluate possible strategic alternatives intended to enhance stockholder value. The Special Committee, with the assistance and support of the Company&#8217;s executive management team and external consultants and advisors, is assessing the Company&#8217;s historical business model and business strategies to evaluate possible strategic alternatives and possible changes to the Company&#8217;s business and operations.

Controlling Shareholder

The Grande Holdings Limited (&#8220;Grande&#8221;), together with S&#38;T International Distribution Limited (&#8220;S&#38;T&#8221;), a subsidiary of Grande, and Grande N.A.K.S. Ltd., a subsidiary of Grande (together with Grande, the &#8220;Reporting Persons&#8221;), have, based on a Schedule 13D/A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) on July 9, 2014, the shared power to vote and direct the disposition of 15,243,283 shares, or approximately 56.2%, of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock. Accordingly, the Company is a &#8220;controlled company&#8221; as defined in Section 801(a) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide. 

On May 31, 2011, upon application of a major creditor, Grande was placed into provisional liquidation when the High Court of Hong Kong appointed joint and several provisional liquidators (&#8220;Provisional Liquidators&#8221;) over Grande. Accordingly, as of May 31, 2011, the directors of Grande no longer had the ability to exercise control over Grande or the power to direct the voting and disposition of the shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock beneficially owned by Grande. In May 2014, Grande, the Provisional Liquidators and a creditor of Grande entered into an agreement to implement the &#8220;Grande Restructuring Plan&#8221; submitted by a creditor 

&#160;

of Grande. Based on pub lic announcements by Grande dated May 26, 2016 (the &#8220;Grande Announcements&#8221;), and subsequently confirmed to the Company by Grande, Grande has completed the Grande Restructuring Plan, the Provisional Liquidators over Grande have been released and discharged by the Hong Kong Court, the winding up of Grande has been permanently stayed, and Grande has fulfilled all trading resumption conditions imposed on Grande by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (&#8220;HKEX&#8221;). Following the completion of the Grande Restructu ring Plan, based on the Grande Announcements and other information received from an affiliate of Grande, certain companies associated with Mr. Ho, the Company&#8217;s Chairman of the Board effective as of June 19 , 2016, hold in the aggregate approximately a 72. 3 % shareholding in Grande , and therefore beneficially control the voting and disposition of the shares of the Company beneficially owned by Grande.

&#160;

&#183; 

recognition of the Emerson &#174; brand; 

&#160;

&#160;

Sales and Distribution 

The Company markets its products exclusively in the United States, primarily through mass merchandisers. 

In fiscal 2016 and 2015, Target accounted for approximately 42% and 51% of the Company&#8217;s net revenues, respectively, and Wal-Mart accounted for approximately 31% and 28% of the Company&#8217;s net revenues, respectively. No other customer accounted for 

&#160;

more than 10% of net revenues in either period. As a percent of the Company&#8217;s total trade accounts receivable, net of specific reserves , Wal-Mart and Target accounted for 88% and nil as of March 31, 2016, respectively, and 30% and 50% as of March 31, 2015, respectively. Management believes that a loss, or a significant reduction, of sales to Target or Wal-Mart would have a material advers e effect on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations. 

Approximately 55% and 61% of the Company&#8217;s net revenues in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, were made through third-party sales representative organizations that receive sales commissions and work in conjunction with the Company&#8217;s own sales personnel. With the Company&#8217;s permission, third-party sales representative organizations may sell competitive products in addition to the Company&#8217;s products. In most instances, either party may terminate a sales representative relationship on 30 days prior notice by the Company and 90 days prior notice by the sales representative organization in accordance with customary industry practice. In fiscal 2016, the Company utilized 8 sales representative organizations, including one which represented approximately 41% of its net revenues, including revenues from one of the Company&#8217;s two major customers described above and one which represented approximately 13% of net revenues. In fiscal 2015, the Company utilized 9 sales representative organizations, including one which represented approximately 54% of its net revenues, including revenues from one of the Company&#8217;s two major customers described above. No other sales representative organization accounted for more than 10% of net revenues in fiscal 2015. The remainder of the Company&#8217;s sales is to customers that are serviced by its sales personnel. Although sales and operating results could be negatively impacted, management does not believe that the loss of one or more sales representative organizations would have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations, as the Company believes that new sales representative organizations could be identified if needed, although that could be a time consuming process. 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s Direct Import Program allows its customers to import and receive product directly from an export port in the country of manufacture outside the United States. Under the Direct Import Program, title for the Company&#8217;s product passes to the customer in the country of origin when the product is shipped by the Company&#8217;s subsidiary in China. The Company also sells product to customers from its United States warehoused inventory, which is referred to as the Domestic Program. Under the Domestic Program, title for product typically passes at the time of shipment. Under both programs, the Company recognizes revenues at the time title passes to the customer. See Item 7 &#8212; &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

The Company has an integrated system to coordinate the purchasing, sales and distribution aspects of its operations. The Company receives orders from its major customers via electronic data interface, facsimile, telephone or mail. The Company does not have long-term contracts with any of its customers, but rather receives orders on an ongoing basis. Products imported by the Company for the Domestic Program, generally from factories in Asia, are shipped by ocean and/or inland freight and then stored in the Company&#8217;s outsourced warehouse facilities for shipment to customers. The Company monitors its inventory levels and goods in transit through the use of an electronic inventory system. When a purchase order under the Domestic Program is received, it is filled from the Company&#8217;s inventory and the warehoused product is labeled and prepared for outbound shipment to the customer by common, contract or small package carrier. 

&#160;

Licensing Activities 

The Company is party to several license agreements with third party licensees that allow the licensees to manufacture and/or sell various products bearing the Company&#8217;s trademarks into defined geographic areas. Such activities have had a positive impact on operating results by generating income with minimal incremental costs and without any working capital requirements, and the Company intends to continue pursuing additional licensing opportunities. The Company protects its brand through careful license and product selection and control processes. As previously disclosed, on December 16, 2015, the Company received written notice from Funai stating its intention to terminate the agreement, with termination to be effective on December 31, 2016. As a result of such termination, unless the Company is successful in securing a new licensee to replace the licensing revenue which will be absent upon the Funai termination, the Company expects fiscal 2017 licensing revenue will decline as compared to fiscal 2016 licensing revenue. As previously disclosed, since this licensing relationship contributes substantial product volume and market presence through Funai&#8217;s manufacture and distribution of products bearing the Emerson &#174; &#160; brand name in the United States, the loss of this relationship and licensing agreement with Funai is expected to materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s revenue, earnings and business. The Company is analyzing the impacts of the Funai termination to its business and is identifying strategic courses of action for consideration, including seeking new licensing relationships. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure a new licensee or distribution relationship to replace the licensing revenue, product volume and market presence of Emerson-branded products in the United States, which had been provided through the license agreement with Funai. 

&#160;

See Item 1A &#8212; &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Business Related R isks &#8212; &#8220; The failure to obtain new licensees to replace the Funai license agreement could materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s revenues, earnings and business .&#8221; and &#8220; The failure by the Company to maintain its relationships with its other licensees or the failure to obtain new licensees could materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s revenues, earnings and business.&#8221; , Item 7 &#8212; &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and Note 10 &#8220;License Agreements&#8221;. 

Design and Manufacturing 

The Company&#8217;s products are manufactured by original equipment manufacturers in accordance with the Company&#8217;s specifications. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, 100% of the Company&#8217;s purchases consisted of finished goods from foreign manufacturers located in People&#8217;s Republic of China. 

The Company&#8217;s design team is responsible for product development and works closely with suppliers and determines the cosmetic and other features for new products. Accordingly, the exterior designs and operating features of the products reflect the Company&#8217;s judgment, or that of its customers, of current styles and consumer preferences. 

The following summarizes the Company&#8217;s purchases from its major suppliers that provided more than 10% of the Company&#8217;s total purchases in fiscal 2016 and 2015:

The Company considers its relationships with its suppliers to be satisfactory and believes that, barring any unusual material or part shortages or economic, fiscal or monetary conditions, the Company could develop alternative suppliers. No assurance can be given that ample supply of product would be available at current prices and on current credit terms if the Company were required to seek alternative sources of supply without adequate notice by a supplier or a reasonable opportunity to seek alternate production facilities and component parts (see Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Business Related Risks &#8212; &#8220;Uncertain Impact of Appointment of Provisional Liquidators for Grande, Emerson&#8217;s Controlling Shareholder&#8221; and Item 7 &#8212; &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221;). 

Warranties 

The Company offers limited warranties for its consumer electronics, comparable to those offered to consumers by the Company&#8217;s competitors in the United States. Such warranties typically consist of a one year period for microwaves and compact refrigerators and a 90 day period for audio products, under which the Company pays for labor and parts, or offers a new or similar unit in exchange for a non-performing unit. 

Returned Products 

The Company&#8217;s customers return product for a variety of reasons, including: 

&#160;

&#183; 

retailer return policies which allow customer returns for no reason concerning the quality of the product itself; 

&#160;

&#183; 

damage to goods in transit and cosmetic imperfections; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

mechanical failures. 

Backlog 

The Company does not believe that backlog is a significant factor. The ability of management to correctly anticipate and provide for inventory requirements is essential to the successful operation of the Company&#8217;s business. 

&#160;

Trademarks 

The Company owns the following principal trademarks for certain consumer electronic products in the United States, Canada, Mexico and various other countries: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Emerson &#174; 

&#160;

&#183;

&#160;

&#183; 

SmartSet &#174; 

The Company&#8217;s trademark registrations must be renewed at various times. The Company intends to renew all trademarks necessary for the conduct of its business. The Company considers the Emerson &#174; trademark to be of material importance to its business and, to a lesser degree, the remaining trademarks. The Company licenses the Emerson &#174; and certain of its other trademarks to third parties, the scope of which is on a limited product and geographic basis and for a period of time. See &#8220;Licensing Activities.&#8221; 

Competition 

The Company primarily competes in the low-to-medium-priced sector of the housewares and consumer electronics market. Management estimates that the Company has several dozen competitors that are manufacturers and/or distributors, many of which are much larger and have greater financial resources than the Company. The Company competes primarily on the basis of: 

&#160;

&#183; 

brand recognition; 

&#160;

&#183; 

reliability; 

&#160;

&#183; 

quality; 

&#160;

&#183; 

price; 

&#160;

&#183; 

design; 

&#160;

&#183; 

consumer acceptance of the Company&#8217;s products; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

the quality of service and support provided to retailers and their customers. 

The Company also competes at the retail level for shelf space and promotional displays, all of which have an impact on its success in established and proposed distribution channels. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

Pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, the Trade Act of 1974 and regulations promulgated there under, the United States government charges tariff duties, excess charges, assessments and penalties on many imports. These regulations are subject to continuous change and revision by government agencies and by action of the United States Trade Representative and may have the effect of increasing the cost of goods purchased by the Company or limiting quantities of goods available to the Company from our overseas suppliers. A number of states have adopted statutes regulating the manner of determining the amount of payments to independent service centers performing warranty service on products such as those sold by the Company. Additional Federal legislation and regulations regarding the importation of consumer electronics products, including the products marketed by the Company, have been proposed from time to time and, if enacted into law, could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160;

Product Liability and Insurance 

Because of the nature of the products it sells, the Company is periodically subject to product liability claims resulting from personal injuries. The Company may also become involved in various lawsuits incidental to its business. 

Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage, there can be no absolute assurance that the Company&#8217;s coverage limits will be sufficient to cover any successful product liability claims made against it in the future. In management&#8217;s opinion, any ultimate liability arising out of currently pending product liability claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition or results of operations. However, any claims substantially in excess of the Company&#8217;s insurance coverage, or any substantial claim not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. 

Employees 

As of June 9, 2016, the Company had approximately 32 employees, comprised of 17 in the United States and 15 in China. None of the Company&#8217;s employees are represented by unions, and the Company believes its labor relations are good.
