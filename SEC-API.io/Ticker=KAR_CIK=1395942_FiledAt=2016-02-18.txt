 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

We are a leading provider of whole car auction services in North America and salvage auction services in North America and the United Kingdom. We facilitate an efficient marketplace by providing auction services for sellers of used, or "whole car," vehicles and salvage vehicles through our 237 physical auction locations at December 31, 2015 , and multiple proprietary Internet venues. In 2015 , we facilitated the sale of over 4.4 million used and salvage vehicles. Our revenues are generated through auction fees from both vehicle buyers and sellers, as well as by providing value-added ancillary services, including transportation, reconditioning, inspections, marshalling, titling and floorplan financing. We facilitate the transfer of ownership directly from seller to buyer and generally we do not take title to or ownership of vehicles sold through our auctions. 

ADESA, our whole car auction services business, is the second largest provider of used vehicle auction services in North America. Vehicles at ADESA's auctions are typically sold by used vehicle dealers, vehicle manufacturers and their captive finance companies, financial institutions, commercial fleet operators and rental car companies to franchised and independent used vehicle dealers. Through ADESA.com, powered by OPENLANE technology, ADESA provides a comprehensive remarketing solution to automobile manufacturers, captive finance companies, lease and daily rental car companies, financial institutions and wholesale automobile auctions. IAA, our salvage auction services business, is one of the two largest providers of salvage auction services in North America and also includes HBC's operations in the United Kingdom. Vehicles at our salvage auctions are typically damaged or low-value vehicles that are predominantly sold by automobile insurance companies, non-profit organizations, automobile dealers, vehicle leasing companies and rental car companies to licensed dismantlers, rebuilders, scrap dealers or qualified public buyers. An important component of ADESA's and IAA's services to their buyers is providing short-term inventory-secured financing, known as floorplan financing, primarily to independent used vehicle dealers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, AFC. 

At December 31, 2015 , we had a North American network of 66 &#32;whole car auction locations and 171 &#32;salvage auction &#32; locations. In addition, HBC operated from 10 locations in the United Kingdom. Our auction locations are primarily standalone facilities dedicated to either whole car or salvage auctions; however, some of our sites are utilized to service both whole car and salvage customers at the same location. We believe our extensive geographic network and diverse product offerings enable us to leverage relationships with North American providers and buyers of used and salvage vehicles. 

Our Corporate History 

KAR Auction Services (formerly KAR Holdings, Inc.) was incorporated in 2006 and commenced operations in April 2007 upon the consummation of the 2007 Transactions. On November 3, 2009, we changed our name from KAR Holdings, Inc. to KAR Auction Services, Inc. ADESA entered the vehicle remarketing industry in 1989 and first became a public company in 1992. In 1994, ADESA acquired AFC. ADESA remained a public company until 1995 when ALLETE purchased a majority of its outstanding equity interests. In June 2004, ALLETE sold 20% of ADESA to the public and then spun off their remaining 80% interest to shareholders in September 2004. ADESA was acquired by the Company in April 2007. IAA entered the vehicle salvage business in 1982, and first became a public company in 1991. After growing through a series of acquisitions, IAA was acquired by affiliates of Kelso &#38; Company and Parthenon Capital in 2005. Affiliates of Kelso &#38; Company and Parthenon Capital and certain members of IAA management contributed IAA to KAR Auction Services in connection with the 2007 Transactions. In a series of transactions between December 2012 and November 2013, the Equity Sponsors sold all of their common stock in secondary offerings. 

Our Industry 

Auctions are the hub of the remarketing system for used and salvage vehicles, bringing professional sellers and buyers together and creating a marketplace for the sale of these vehicles. Whole car auction vehicles include vehicles from dealers turning their inventory, off-lease vehicles, vehicles repossessed by financial institutions and rental and other program fleet vehicles that have reached a predetermined age or mileage. The salvage vehicle auction industry provides a venue for sellers, primarily automobile insurance companies, to dispose or liquidate damaged or low value vehicles to dismantlers, rebuilders, scrap dealers or qualified public buyers. The following are key industry highlights: 

Whole Car Auction Industry Volumes 

Whole car auction volumes in North America, including online only volumes, were approximately 8.7 million, 9.2 million and an estimated 9.8 million in 2013 , 2014 &#32;and 2015 , respectively. Data for the whole car auction industry is collected by the National Auto Auction Association ("NAAA") through an annual survey. NAAA industry volumes for 2015 &#32;have not yet been released; however, we estimate that used vehicle auction volumes in North America in 2015 &#32;will be approximately 9.8 million vehicles (including approximately 0.6 million vehicles sold online by ADESA prior to reaching a physical auction). We expect the industry to experience an increase in whole car auction volumes in 2016 as a result of increasing new vehicle sales and lease originations since 2009, as well as readily available credit, which supports retail used car sales. 

Salvage Auction Industry Volumes 

We believe that the North American salvage vehicle auction industry volumes are affected primarily by accident rates, the age of the vehicle fleet on the road, miles driven, weather, the complexity of vehicles in operation, repair costs and recycled parts utilization. Vehicles deemed a total loss by automobile insurance companies represent the largest category of vehicles sold in the salvage vehicle auction industry. As vehicle design becomes more complex with additional enhancements, such as airbags and electrical components, vehicles are more costly to repair following an accident and insurance companies are more likely to declare a damaged vehicle a total loss. In addition, the utilization of recycled parts from salvage vehicles by the collision repair industry continues to increase as the quality of these parts gains wider acceptance and insurance companies attempt to reduce their repair claim costs. We believe that salvage volumes will continue to grow over time as the salvage auction industry expands. 

Consolidated Whole Car and Salvage Auction Markets 

The North American used vehicle auction market is largely consolidated. We estimate that Manheim, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, and ADESA together represent approximately 70% of the North American whole car auction market. We estimate that ADESA represents approximately 25% of the North American whole car auction market. The North American salvage vehicle auction market is also largely consolidated with the top two competitors, IAA and Copart, Inc., together representing approximately 80% of the market. 

Our Business Strategy 

Comprehensive Global Strategy 

The Company has a comprehensive global strategy that leverages KAR&#8217;s unique collection of assets, proven track record with commercial sellers, extensive North American physical footprint, global network of customers and unique set of transaction data. The Company&#8217;s strategy for the future builds on this base and we believe it will enable the Company to meet new opportunities emerging in the automotive remarketing industry, which is being impacted by several meaningful trends, including: 

&#8226; 

Remarketing channels and systems that are increasingly becoming more interconnected; and 

&#8226; 

An increase in more data-based buying and selling. 

We believe that the Company&#8217;s collection of 237 whole car and salvage auctions, along with their online counterparts, makes us uniquely qualified to provide the best set of remarketing marketplaces for our customers. To execute our strategy of providing the best remarketing venue and the analytical evidence for every vehicle, we intend to focus on the following strategic initiatives: 

&#8226; 

Develop alternative marketplaces . The Company is identifying innovative venues for the exchange of used vehicles through internal development, targeted partnerships and acquisitions. 

&#8226; 

Establish exceptional analytics capabilities . The Company has observed increased demand from commercial customers (e.g., OEMs, insurance companies, finance companies, rental companies, large dealer groups, etc.) for more sophisticated, data-driven, end-to-end remarketing solutions. As a result, the Company is investing in data science and securing access to new data sets to build value-added proprietary solutions. 

&#8226; 

Leverage the Company&#8217;s unique remarketing portfolio and data . As a leader in both whole car and salvage auctions, as well as alternative marketplaces, the Company has insight into which venues will best match supply and demand and improve economic outcomes for sellers and buyers by reducing risk, improving efficiency and enhancing transparency. The Company intends to provide proprietary analytical solutions to its customers based on data across multiple marketplaces. 

&#8226; 

Grow the Company&#8217;s buyer base . The Company has a global buyer base and plans to continue to invest in attracting and maintaining a broad customer base to create liquid and efficient markets. 

Expanding Opportunities for Customers to Buy and Sell Online 

We are focused on enhancing our Internet solutions in all of the key channels we operate in, and we will continue to invest in technology platforms in order to capitalize on new opportunities and attract new customers. Online vehicle remarketing solutions provide the opportunity to improve the customer experience, expand our volume of transactions and potentially increase proceeds for sellers through greater buyer participation at auctions. We acquired OPENLANE in order to better capitalize on the increasing use of the Internet as a means to purchase wholesale vehicles. Through its OPENLANE technology, ADESA offers comprehensive private label remarketing solutions to automobile manufacturers, captive finance companies, lease and daily rental car companies, financial institutions and wholesale automobile auctions throughout the United States and Canada. IAA is the only national salvage auction company that offers buyers both live and Internet purchasing opportunities. ADESA provides online solutions to sell vehicles directly from a dealership or other interim storage location (upstream selling); online solutions to offer vehicles for sale while in transit to auction locations (midstream selling); simultaneously broadcasting video and audio of the physical auctions to online bidders (LiveBlock &#174; ); and bulletin-board or real-time online auctions (DealerBlock &#174; ). 

Using Excess Cash Flow to Invest in Strategic Growth Initiatives and Return Capital to Shareholders 

We generate strong cash flows as a result of our attractive gross margins, the ability to leverage our corporate infrastructure across our multiple auction locations, low levels of capital expenditures and limited working capital requirements. Management plans to utilize excess cash generated by the business to invest in strategic growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders. We generated $475.0 million and $431.3 million of cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. After paying any future dividends to shareholders (subject to prior declaration by our board of directors), we expect that significant cash flow will remain to support growth initiatives. 

Selective acquisitions and greenfield expansion represent possible growth initiatives. Increased demand for single source solutions by our customers and other factors may increase our opportunities to acquire competitors. Both ADESA and IAA have a strong record of acquiring and integrating independent auction operations and improving profitability. We will continue to 

evaluate opportunities to open and acquire new sites in selected markets in order to effectively leverage our sales and marketing capabilities and expand our buyer base and geographic presence for both ADESA and IAA. In addition, we may pursue opportunities to acquire additional product offerings in each of our business segments. 

On April 2, 2015, July 2, 2015, October 1, 2015 and January 7, 2016 we paid a cash dividend of $0.27 per share to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 25, 2015, June 24, 2015, September 23, 2015 and December 22, 2015, respectively. On February 17, 2016, we announced that our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.29 per share payable on April 5, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 23, 2016. 

In October 2014, our board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to $300 million of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock through October 28, 2016. Repurchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities laws and regulations, including pursuant to repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing and amount of any repurchases is subject to market and other conditions. As of December 31, 2015, we had repurchased and retired a total of 5.3 million shares of common stock. As of January 2016, upon completion of the accelerated share repurchase agreement, approximately 0.8 million additional shares of common stock were retired. 

Increasing Our International Presence 

In both our whole car and salvage vehicle businesses, we have experience managing a global buyer base with relationships in over 100 countries. We believe we are well positioned to grow internationally through both technology-based and physical auction expansion. We continue to identify opportunities to expand certain of our service offerings globally. We expect that our ability to efficiently layer in our product and technology licensing will allow us to enter other mature auction markets. 

In June 2015, we completed the acquisition of HBC. HBC is headquartered in Canvey Island, England and provides salvage collection and disposal services for the U.K.'s top insurance, fleet and accident management companies. 

Continuing to Improve Operating Efficiency 

We continue to focus on reducing costs by optimizing efficiency at each of our auction locations and consolidating certain management functions. Since 2007, a number of initiatives have been implemented, which have streamlined operations and improved operating efficiencies. As part of these initiatives, we introduced a management operating system to actively monitor and manage staffing levels and, as a result, have realized additional labor efficiency gains. Additional efficiencies have been gained through two of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, AuctionTrac, a vehicle tracking system at ADESA, and CarsArrive, an Internet-based system that allows customers to instantly review price quotes, delivery times, available transportation loads and also to receive instant notification of available shipments. In 2013, ADESA acquired High Tech Locksmiths ("HTL") and integrated ADESA's key-cutting services, one of the many ancillary services provided by ADESA, with HTL. 

Continuing to Grow Revenue per Vehicle 

From 2011 through 2015, our whole car and salvage revenue per vehicle sold at our physical auction sites grew at compound annual growth rates of 3.2% and 1.0%, respectively. Revenue per vehicle generally consists of auction fees and fees from ancillary and other related services. Increased utilization of ancillary services, selective fee increases, higher used vehicle prices and the introduction of new product offerings were key components of this growth. We believe these services provide economic benefits to our customers who are willing to utilize our products and services that improve their ability to manage their remarketing efforts and increase their returns. We plan to grow revenue by increasing customer utilization of new and existing products and by enhancing our core auction services, including providing additional services to customers of acquired enterprises. 

Our Business Segments 

We operate as three reportable business segments: ADESA Auctions, IAA and AFC. Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;were distributed as follows: ADESA 52%, IAA 38% and AFC 10%. Geographic information as well as comparative segment revenues and related financial information pertaining to ADESA, IAA and AFC for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;are presented in the tables in Note 19, Segment Information, &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements for KAR Auction Services, Inc., which are included under Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ADESA 

Overview 

We are the second largest provider of whole car auctions and related services to the vehicle remarketing industry in North America. We serve our customer base through online auctions and auction facilities that are developed and strategically located to draw professional sellers and buyers together and allow the buyers to inspect and compare vehicles remotely or in person. Our online service offerings include ADESA.com, LiveBlock and DealerBlock and allow us to offer vehicles for sale from any location. 

Vehicles available at our auctions include vehicles from institutional customers such as off-lease vehicles, repossessed vehicles, rental vehicles and other program fleet vehicles that have reached a predetermined age or mileage and have been repurchased by the manufacturers, as well as vehicles from used vehicle dealers turning their inventory. The number of vehicles offered for sale at auction is the key driver of our costs incurred in the whole car auction process, and the number of vehicles sold is the key driver of the related fees generated by the remarketing process. 

We offer both online and physical auctions as well as value-enhancing ancillary services in an effective and efficient manner to maximize returns for the sellers of used vehicles. We quickly transfer the vehicles and ownership to the buyer and the net funds to the seller. Vehicles are typically offered for sale at the physical auctions on at least a weekly basis at most locations and the auctions are simulcast over the Internet with streaming audio and video (LiveBlock) so that remote bidders can participate via our online capabilities. Our online auctions (DealerBlock) function 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, providing our customers with maximum exposure for their vehicles and the flexibility to offer vehicles at buy now prices or in auctions that last for a few hours, days or even weeks. We also provide customized "private label" selling systems (including buy now functionality as well as online auctions) for our customers, primarily utilizing technology acquired with the purchase of OPENLANE. 

We generate revenue primarily from auction fees paid by vehicle buyers and sellers. Generally, we do not take title to or bear the risk of loss for vehicles sold at whole car auctions. Our buyer fees and dealer seller fees are typically based on a tiered structure with fees increasing with the sale price of the vehicle, while institutional seller fees are typically fixed. We add buyer fees to the gross sales price paid by buyers for each vehicle, and generally customers do not receive title or possession of vehicles after purchase until payment is received, proof of floorplan financing is provided or credit is approved. We generally deduct seller fees and other ancillary service fees to sellers from the gross sales price of each vehicle before remitting the net amount to the seller. 

Customers 

Suppliers of vehicles to our whole car auctions primarily include (i) large institutions, such as vehicle manufacturers and their captive finance arms, vehicle rental companies, financial institutions, and commercial fleets and fleet management companies (collectively "institutional customers"); and (ii) franchised and independent used vehicle dealers (collectively "dealer customers"). For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the seller and ancillary fees recognized from any single supplier did not account for more than 5% of ADESA's revenues. 

Buyers of vehicles at our whole car auctions primarily include franchised and independent used vehicle dealers. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the buyer and ancillary fees recognized from any single buyer did not account for more than 3% of ADESA's revenues. 

Services 

Our whole car auctions also provide a full range of innovative and value-added services to sellers and buyers that enable us to serve as a "one-stop shop." Many of these services may be provided or purchased independently from the auction process, including: 

Services 

&#160; 

Description 

Auction Related Services 

&#160; 

ADESA provides marketing and advertising for the vehicles to be auctioned, dealer registration, storage of consigned and purchased inventory, clearing of funds, arbitration of disputes, auction vehicle registration, condition report processing, post-sale inspections, security for consigned inventory, title processing, sales results reports, pre-sale lineups and auctioning of vehicles by licensed auctioneers. 

Transportation Services 

&#160; 

We provide both inbound (pickup) and outbound (delivery) transportation services utilizing our own equipment and personnel as well as licensed and insured third party carriers. Through our subsidiary, CarsArrive and its Internet-based system which provides automated vehicle shipping services, customers can instantly review price quotes and delivery times, and vehicle transporters can check available loads and also receive instant notification of available shipments. The same system is utilized at our whole car auction locations. 

Reconditioning Services 

&#160; 

Our auctions provide detailing, body work, paintless dent repair ("PDR"), light mechanical work, glass repair, tire and key replacement and upholstery repair. Key replacement services are primarily provided by our subsidiary, HTL. 

Inspection Services Provided By AutoVIN 

&#160; 

AutoVIN provides vehicle condition reporting, inventory verification auditing, program compliance auditing and facility inspections. Field managers are equipped with handheld computers and digital cameras to record all inspection and audit data on-site. The same technology is utilized at our whole car auction locations and we believe that the expanded utilization of comprehensive vehicle condition reports with pictures facilitates dealers sourcing vehicles via the Internet. 

Title and Repossession Administration and Remarketing Services 

&#160; 

PAR provides end-to-end management of the remarketing process including titling, repossession administration, inventory management, auction selection, pricing and representation of the vehicles at auction for those customers seeking to outsource all or just a portion of their remarketing needs. Recovery Database Network, Inc. ("RDN") is a specialized provider of B2B software and data solutions for automotive lenders and repossession companies. 

Vehicle Research Services Provided by AutoNiq 

&#160; 

AutoNiq provides dealers real-time vehicle information such as pricing, history reports and market guides. Its mobile app allows used car dealers to scan VINs on mobile devices, view auction run lists and access vehicle history reports and market value reports instantly. AutoNiq offers access to valued resources such as CARFAX and AutoCheck, as well as Black Book Daily, NADA guides, Kelley Blue Book and Galves pricing guide information. It also includes a comprehensive wholesale and retail market report for all markets in the United States. 

ADESA Analytical Services 

&#160; 

ADESA Analytical Services provides value-added market analysis to our customers and the media. These services include access to publications and custom analysis of wholesale market trends for ADESA's customers, including peer group and market benchmarking studies, analysis of the benefits of reconditioning, site selection for optimized remarketing of vehicles, portfolio analysis of auction sales and computer-generated mapping and buyer analysis. 

Sales and Marketing 

Our sales and marketing approach at ADESA is to develop strong relationships and interactive dialogue with our customers. We have relationship managers for the various institutional customers, including vehicle manufacturers, rental car companies, finance companies and others. These relationship managers focus on current trends and customer needs for their respective customers in order to better coordinate our sales effort and service offerings. 

Managers of individual auction locations are ultimately responsible for providing services to the institutional customers whose vehicles are directed to the auctions by the corporate sales team. Developing and servicing the largest possible population of buying dealers for the vehicles consigned for sale at each auction is integral to maximizing value for our vehicle suppliers. 

We have local auction sales representatives who have experience in the used vehicle business and an intimate knowledge of local markets. These local representatives focus on the dealer segment and are complemented by local telesales representatives and are managed by a corporate-level team focused on developing and implementing standard best practices. We believe this combination of a centralized structure with decentralized resources enhances relationships with the dealer community and may further increase dealer consignment business at our auctions. 

Through our ADESA Analytical Services department, we also provide market analysis to our customers, as they use analytical techniques in making their remarketing decisions. 

Online Solutions 

Our current ADESA online solutions include: 

Proprietary ADESA Technology 

&#160; 

Description 

ADESA.com and ADESA DealerBlock&#174; 

&#160; 

This platform provides for either real-time or "bulletin-board" online auctions of consigned inventory at physical auction locations and is powered by the technology we acquired from OPENLANE. We also utilize this platform to provide upstream and midstream selling capabilities for our consignors, which facilitate the sale of vehicles prior to their arrival at a physical auction site. Auctions can be either closed (restricted to certain eligible dealers) or open (available to all eligible dealers) and inventory feeds of vehicles are automated with many customers' systems as well as third party providers that are integrated with various dealer management systems. Oftentimes, the upstream and midstream closed sales are "private-labeled" for the consignors. 

ADESA LiveBlock&#174; 

&#160; 

Our live auction Internet bidding solution, ADESA LiveBlock&#174;, operates in concert with our physical auctions and provides registered buyers with the opportunity to participate in live auctions. Potential buyers bid online in real time along with the live local bidders and other Internet bidders via a simple, web-based interface. ADESA LiveBlock&#174; provides real-time streaming audio and video from the live auction and still images of vehicles and other data. Buyers inspect and evaluate the vehicle and listen to the live call of the auctioneer while viewing the physical auction that is underway. 

ADESA Run List&#174; 

&#160; 

Provides a summary of consigned vehicles offered for auction sale, allowing dealers to preview inventory and vehicle condition reports prior to an auction event. 

ADESA Market Guide&#174; 

&#160; 

Provides wholesale auction prices, auction sales results, market data and vehicle condition information. 

ADESA Virtual Inventory 

&#160; 

Subscription-based service to allow dealers to embed ADESA's search technology into a dealer's Web site to increase the number of vehicles advertised by the dealer. 

Competition 

In the North American whole car auction industry, we compete with Manheim, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, Inc., OVE.com (Manheim's "Online Vehicle Exchange"), SmartAuction, as well as several smaller chains of auctions and independent auctions, some of which are affiliated through their membership in industry associations. In the United States, competition is strongest with Manheim for the supply of used vehicles from national institutional customers. In Canada, we are the largest provider of whole car vehicle auction services. The supply of vehicles from dealers is dispersed among all of the auctions in the used vehicle market. 

Due to the increased viability of the Internet as a marketing and distribution channel, new competition has arisen from Internet-based companies and our own customers who have historically remarketed vehicles through various channels, including auctions. Direct sales of vehicles by institutional customers and large dealer groups through internally developed or third-party online platforms have largely replaced telephonic and other non-auction methods, becoming a significant portion of overall used vehicle remarketing. The extent of use of direct, online systems varies by customer. In addition, we and some of our competitors offer online auctions in connection with physical auctions, and other online companies now include used vehicles among the products offered at their auctions. 

IAA 

Overview 

As one of the leading providers of salvage vehicle auctions and related services, we operate as IAA in the United States and Impact Auto Auctions in Canada and serve our customer base through salvage auction locations throughout North America. We facilitate the remarketing of vehicles for a variety of sellers, including insurance companies, dealerships, rental car companies, fleet lease companies and charitable organizations. Our auctions provide buyers from around the globe with the salvage vehicles they need to fulfill their scrap demand, replacement part inventory or vehicle rebuild requirements. Fees for our services are earned from both sellers and buyers of salvage vehicles. 

In June 2015, we acquired HBC, a salvage vehicle auction business operating in the United Kingdom. HBC provides salvage collection and disposal services for the U.K.'s top insurance, fleet and accident management companies, and conducts business using a variety of sales channels, including online auctions. HBC's business model differs from that of IAA, as the majority of HBC's vehicles are sold under purchase contracts. 

IAA processes salvage vehicles primarily on a consignment basis. In return for agreed-upon fees, vehicles are sold on behalf of our sellers, which continue to own the vehicle until it is sold to buyers at auction. Other services available to vehicle sellers, for which fees may be charged, include towing, title processing, inspection services, marketing and other administrative services. Under all methods of sale, we also charge fees to the buyer of each vehicle based on a tiered structure that increases with the sale price of the vehicle as well as fixed fees for other services. 

Auctions are typically held weekly at most locations. Vehicles are marketed at each respective auction site to live bidders as well as to online bidders via IAA's dual platform auction model. In addition, auction listings are available online, allowing prospective bidders to preview and bid on vehicles prior to the actual auction event. IAA's Auction Center feature provides Internet buyers with an open, competitive bidding environment that reflects the dynamics of a live salvage auction. The Auction Center includes such services as comprehensive auction lists featuring links to digital images of vehicles available for sale, a "Find a Vehicle" function that promotes the search for specific vehicles within the auction system and special auction notifications such as "Rental," "Classic," or "Motorcycles." Higher prices at auction are generally driven by broader market exposure and increased competitive bidding. Our mobile device applications provide great flexibility for buyers who interact with our auctions. In 2014, we received external recognition for our technology innovation, including: ranking 33 rd &#32;in Informationweek's Elite 100 and being named as a finalist in the Best Customer App category at the Consumerism in IT (CITE) Awards. Our mobile applications are designed for the latest handheld devices, including Apple and Android, and are optimized for the most recent operating systems. 

Online tools have also been developed to assist consignors in remarketing their vehicles and establishing salvage vehicle values. In 2013, we launched the IAA Market Value app via our CSAToday&#174; salvage management platform. The Mobile Assignment feature allows consignors to assign vehicles to IAA virtually anytime, anywhere. As well, our Market Value app allows customers to estimate the value of their vehicle whenever and wherever they need to. Through IAA's auction model, vehicles are offered simultaneously to live and online buyers in a live auction format utilizing i-Bid LIVE SM . We believe the capability of the auction models maximizes auction proceeds and returns to our customers. First, the physical auctions allow buyers to inspect and compare the vehicles, enabling them to make fully-informed bidding decisions. These physical auction abilities are an important part of the bidding process. Second, our Internet auction capabilities allow buyers to participate in a greater number of auctions than if physical attendance was required. Online inventory browsing and digital alerts (via email or through buyer app) reduce the time required to acquire vehicles. 

Services 

IAA offers a comprehensive suite of auction, logistics and vehicle selling services aimed at maximizing the value of vehicles sold at auction, lowering administrative costs, shortening the selling cycle and increasing the predictability of returns to vehicle sellers. This is achieved while expanding IAA's ability to handle an increasing proportion of the vehicle-processing function as a "one-stop shop" for sellers. Some of the services provided by IAA include: 

Services 

&#160; 

Description 

Live and Live Online Auction Model 

&#160; 

Vehicles are offered simultaneously to live and online buyers in a live auction format utilizing i-Bid LIVE SM technology. We believe this exposes the vehicles to the maximum number of potential buyers. 

Total Loss Solutions TM 

&#160; 

Provides insurance companies with outsource solutions for the portion of the claims process prior to total loss determination and assignment to a salvage auction. The suite of products includes vehicle inspection and title procurement services that help insurance companies reduce cycle time and cost, while improving employee engagement, ultimately increasing policyholder retention. 

IAA Title Management 

&#160; 

After a vehicle is received at one of our facilities, it remains in storage inventory and cannot be auctioned until IAA receives and processes its transferable title. We process title documents in order to comply with the Department of Motor Vehicles ("DMV") requirements for all vehicles. Wherever possible, we maintain working relationships with each state's respective DMV to supplement an established electronic interface. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

IAA Title Management services range from aging inventory reports to complete oversight of the title process. Our titling expertise results in faster cycle time, which decreases expenses for the vehicle suppliers like insurance companies. 

Vehicle Inspection Centers 

&#160; 

We maintain vehicle inspection centers ("VIC") at many of our facilities. A VIC is a temporary storage and inspection facility located at one of our sites that is operated by the insurance company. Some of these sites are formalized through temporary license agreements with the insurance companies that supply the vehicles. Having a VIC minimizes vehicle storage charges incurred by insurance company suppliers at the temporary storage facility or repair shop and also improves service time for the policyholder. 

Transportation and Towing 

&#160; 

Inbound logistics administration with actual services typically provided by third-party carriers. 

Remarketing Division 

&#160; 

Focuses on vehicles, rental sellers, fleet and leasing companies, banks and dealer trade-in inventory. 

Donation Division 

&#160; 

Processes vehicles for a variety of charitable organizations across the United States and Canada, assisting them in turning donated vehicles into cash to support their respective cause. 

Customers 

We obtain IAA's supply of vehicles from insurance companies, non-profit organizations, automobile dealers and vehicle leasing and rental car companies and the general public. We have established long-term relationships with virtually all of the major automobile insurance companies. The vast majority of the vehicles we process are on a consignment basis. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the seller and ancillary fees recognized from any single seller did not account for more than 3% of IAA's revenues. 

The buyers of salvage vehicles include automotive body shops, rebuilders, used car dealers, automotive wholesalers, exporters, dismantlers, recyclers, brokers, and where allowed, non-licensed (public) buyers. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the buyer and ancillary fees recognized from any single buyer did not account for more than 4% of IAA's revenues. 

Sales and Marketing 

The IAA sales force solicits prospective vehicle sellers and buyers at the national, regional and local levels. Branch managers address customer needs at the local level. We also participate in a number of local, regional and national trade show events that further promote the benefits of our products and services. 

In addition to providing sellers with a means of processing and selling vehicles, IAA offers a comprehensive suite of services to help maximize returns and shorten the selling and processing time. We help establish workflow integration within our sellers' processes, and view such mutually beneficial relationships as an essential component of our effort to attract and retain suppliers. 

By analyzing industry data, we provide sellers with a detailed analysis of their current selling prices and returns, and a proposal detailing methods to improve selling prices and returns, reduce administrative costs and provide proprietary turn-key selling and processing services. 

We also focus on expanding our seller relationships through recommendations from customers at the local level to other local offices of the same company. Our broad and industry leading geographic coverage allows us to service sellers on a national basis.

Proprietary IAA Technology 

&#160; 

Description 

i-Bid LIVE SM 

&#160; 

Our live auction Internet bidding solution, i-Bid LIVE, operates in concert with our physical auctions and provides registered buyers with the opportunity to participate in live auctions. Potential buyers bid online in real time along with the live local bidders and other Internet bidders via a simple, web-based interface. In addition, i-Bid LIVE provides real-time streaming audio from the live auction and images of salvage vehicles and other data. Buyers inspect and evaluate the salvage vehicle and listen to the auction while it is underway. 

I-Buy Fast SM 

&#160; 

I-Buy Fast is an immediate buying option that allows qualified buyers to purchase vehicles between auctions for a fixed price. Each I-Buy Fast vehicle first runs at a previous auction where an established reserve price was not met. 

CSAToday&#174; 

&#160; 

The process of salvage disposition through our system begins when a vehicle seller first consigns the vehicle to be sold through IAA via a variety of factors including a total loss, a recovered theft, a vehicle donation, a fleet vehicle retired, a vehicle repossessed, etc. A seller representative consigns the vehicle to us, either by phone, facsimile or electronically through CSAToday, our online proprietary salvage inventory management system. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

With CSAToday, vehicle sellers enter vehicle data electronically and then track and manage the progress of vehicles in terms of both time and sales price. With this tool, they have 24-hour access to their vehicles. The information provided through this system ranges from the details associated with a specific vehicle, to comprehensive management reports for an entire area or geographic region. Additional features of this system include inventory management tools and a powerful new IAA Market Value TM tool that helps customers determine the approximate value of a potential vehicle. This tool is helpful to adjusters when evaluating the "repair vs. total" decision. The management tools provided by CSAToday enable seller personnel to monitor and manage their vehicles more effectively. For example, insurance company sellers can also use CSAToday to view original garage receipts, verify ignition key availability, view settlement documents and images of the vehicles and receive updates of other current meaningful data. 

Automated Salvage Auction Processing (ASAP) 

&#160; 

We have developed a proprietary web-based information system, Automated Salvage Auction Processing system, or ASAP, to streamline all aspects of our operations and centralize operational data collection. The system provides sellers with 24-hour online access to powerful tools to manage the salvage disposition process, including inventory management, sales price analysis and electronic data interchange of titling information. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our other information systems, including i-Bid LIVE and CSAToday systems, are integrated with our ASAP product, facilitating seamless auction processes and information flow with internal operational systems. Our technology platform is a significant competitive advantage that allows us to efficiently manage our business, improve customer selling prices, shorten customers' selling cycle and lower our customers' administration costs. 

Competition 

In the salvage sector, the competition includes Copart; Total Resource Auctions (a Cox Automotive company); independent auctions, some of which are affiliated through their membership in industry organizations to provide broader coverage through network relationships; and a limited number of used vehicle auctions that regularly remarket salvage vehicles. Additionally, some dismantlers of salvage vehicles such as LKQ Corporation and Internet-based companies have entered the market, thus providing alternate avenues for sellers to remarket vehicles. While most insurance companies have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles without the use of service providers such as us, they may in the future decide to dispose of their vehicles directly to end users. 

In Canada, we are the largest provider of salvage vehicle auction services. Our competitors include Copart, independent vehicle auctions, brokers, online auction companies, and vehicle recyclers and dismantlers. 

AFC 

Overview 

We are a leading provider of floorplan financing to independent used vehicle dealers. We provide short-term inventory-secured financing, known as floorplan financing, to independent used vehicle dealers through branches throughout North America. In 2015 , AFC serviced over 1.6 million loan transactions, which includes both loans paid off and loans extended, or curtailed. We sell the majority of our U.S. dollar-denominated finance receivables without recourse to a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which sells an undivided participation interest in such finance receivables to a group of bank purchasers on a revolving basis. We also securitize the majority of our Canadian dollar denominated finance receivables through a separate third-party facility. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from fees. These fees include origination, floorplan, curtailment and other related program fees. When the loan is extended or paid in full, AFC collects all accrued fees and interest. 

In June 2013, we acquired Preferred Warranties, Inc., a vehicle service contract business, as part of our strategy to provide new services to independent used vehicle dealers. We receive advance payments for the vehicle service contracts and unearned revenue is deferred and recognized over the terms of the contracts, which range from 3 months to 7 years, on an individual contract basis. The average term of these contracts originated in 2015 was approximately 1.6 years. We currently purchase program insurance which provides for satisfaction of certain of the Company's vehicle service contracts related liabilities in the event the Company is unable to perform under the terms of specific vehicle service contracts covered by program insurance. 

Customers and Locations 

Floorplan financing supports independent used vehicle dealers in North America who purchase vehicles from our auctions, other auctions and non-auction purchases. In 2015 , over 84% of the vehicles floorplanned by AFC were vehicles purchased by dealers at auction. Our ability to provide floorplan financing facilitates the growth of vehicle sales at auction. As of December 31, 2015 , we serviced auctions through 118 &#32;locations which are conveniently located at or within close proximity of auctions held by ADESA and other auctions, which allows dealers to reduce transaction time by providing immediate payment for vehicles purchased at auction. We provide availability lists on behalf of our customers to auction representatives regarding the financing capacity of our customers, thereby increasing the purchasing potential at auctions. In addition, we have the ability to send finance representatives on-site to most approved independent auctions during auction sale-days, as well as maintaining a presence at the ADESA auctions. Geographic proximity to the customers gives our employees the ability to stay in close contact with outstanding accounts, thereby better enabling them to manage credit risk. 

As of December 31, 2015 , AFC had approximately 11,300 active dealers with an average line of credit of approximately $230,000 and no one dealer representing greater than 1.2% of our portfolio. An average of approximately 16 vehicles per active dealer was floorplanned with an approximate average value outstanding of $9,100 per vehicle as of December 31, 2015 . 

Sales and Marketing 

AFC approaches and seeks to expand its share of the independent dealer floorplan market through a number of methods and channels. We target and solicit new dealers through both direct sales efforts at the dealer's place of business as well as auction-based sales and customer service representatives, who service our dealers at auctions where they replenish and rotate vehicle inventory. These largely local efforts are handled by branch managers, branch personnel and area sales managers. AFC's corporate-level team and Business Development Center provide sales and marketing support to AFC field personnel by helping to identify target dealers and coordinating promotional activity with auctions and other vehicle supply sources. 

Credit 

Our procedures and proprietary computer-based system enable us to manage our credit risk by tracking each vehicle from origination to payoff, while expediting services through our branch network. Typically, we assess a floorplan fee at the inception of a loan and we collect all accrued fees and interest when the loan is extended or repaid in full. In addition, AFC generally holds the title or other evidence of ownership to all vehicles which are floorplanned. Typical loan terms are 30 to 90 days, each with a possible loan extension. For an additional fee, this loan extension allows the dealer to extend the duration of the loan beyond the original term for another 30 to 90 days if the dealer makes payment towards principal and pays accrued fees and interest. 

The extension of a credit line to a dealer starts with the underwriting process. Credit lines up to $500,000 are extended using a proprietary scoring model developed internally by AFC. Credit lines in excess of $500,000 may be extended using underwriting guidelines which generally require dealership and personal financial statements, monthly bank statement, sales reports and tax returns. The underwriting of each line of credit requires an analysis, write-up and recommendation by the credit department and, in case of credit lines in excess of $500,000, final review by a credit committee. 

Collateral Management 

Collateral management is an integral part of daily operations at each AFC branch and our corporate headquarters. AFC's proprietary computer-based system facilitates this daily collateral management by providing real-time access to dealer information and enables branch and corporate personnel to assess and manage potential collection issues. Restrictions are automatically placed on customer accounts in the event of a delinquency, payments by dealers from bank accounts with insufficient funds or poor audit results. Branch personnel are proactive in managing collateral by monitoring loans and notifying dealers that payments are coming due. In addition, approximately 85,000 routine audits, or lot checks, are performed annually on the dealers' lots through our AutoVIN subsidiary. Poor results from lot checks typically require branch personnel to take actions to determine the status of missing collateral, including visiting the dealer personally, verifying units held off-site and collecting payments for units sold. Audits also identify troubled accounts, triggering the involvement of AFC's collections department. 

AFC operates two divisions which are organized into thirteen regions in North America. Each division and region is monitored by managers who oversee daily operations. At the corporate level, AFC employs full-time collection specialists and collection attorneys who are assigned to specific regions and monitor collection activity for these areas. Collection specialists work closely with the branches to track trends before an account becomes a troubled account and to determine, together with collection attorneys, the best strategy to secure the collateral once a troubled account is identified. 

Securitization 

AFC sells the majority of its U.S. dollar denominated finance receivables on a revolving basis and without recourse to a wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote, consolidated, special purpose subsidiary ("AFC Funding Corporation"), established for the purpose of purchasing AFC's finance receivables. A securitization agreement allows for the revolving sale by AFC Funding Corporation to a group of bank purchasers of undivided interests in certain finance receivables subject to committed liquidity. AFC's securitization facility has been in place since 1996. AFC Funding Corporation had a committed facility of $1.15 billion &#32;from a third party facility for U.S. finance receivables at December 31, 2015 . The agreement expires on June 29, 2018. 

We also have an agreement in place for the securitization of Automotive Finance Canada Inc.'s ("AFCI") receivables. This securitization facility provides up to C$125 million &#32;in financing for eligible finance receivables through a third party conduit (separate from the U.S. facility). The agreement expires on June 29, 2018. The receivables sold pursuant to both the U.S. and Canadian securitization agreements are accounted for as secured borrowings. 

Competition 

AFC primarily provides short-term dealer floorplan financing of wholesale vehicles to independent vehicle dealers in North America. At the national level, AFC's competition includes NextGear Capital, a Cox Automotive company, other specialty lenders, banks and financial institutions. At the local level, AFC faces competition from banks, credit unions and independent auctions who may offer floorplan financing to local auction customers. Such entities typically service only one or a small number of auctions. 

Some of our industry competitors who operate whole car auctions on a national scale may endeavor to capture a larger portion of the floorplan financing market. AFC competes primarily on the basis of quality of service, convenience of payment, scope of services offered and historical and consistent commitment to the sector. Our long-term relationships with customers have been established over time and act as a competitive strength for us. 

Seasonality 

The volume of vehicles sold through our auctions generally fluctuates from quarter to quarter. This seasonality is caused by several factors including weather, the timing of used vehicles available for sale from selling customers, the availability and quality of salvage vehicles, holidays, and the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles, which affects the demand side of the auction industry. Used vehicle auction volumes tend to decline during prolonged periods of winter weather conditions. In addition, mild weather conditions and decreases in traffic volume can each lead to a decline in the available supply of salvage vehicles because fewer traffic accidents occur, resulting in fewer damaged vehicles overall. As a result, revenues and operating expenses related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis. The fourth calendar quarter typically experiences lower used vehicle auction volume as well as additional costs associated with the holidays and winter weather. 

Vehicle and Lending Regulation 

Our operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state, provincial and local authorities, agencies, statutes and ordinances, which, among other things, require us to obtain and maintain certain licenses, permits and qualifications, provide certain disclosures and notices and limit interest rates, fees and other charges. Some examples of the regulations and laws that impact our company are included in Item 1A "Risk Factors" under the risk: "We are subject to extensive governmental regulations, including vehicle brokerage and auction laws and currency reporting obligations. Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions." 

Environmental Regulation 

Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the emission or discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the generation, treatment, storage and release of hazardous materials and wastes and the investigation and remediation of contamination. Our failure to comply with current or future environmental, health or safety laws or to obtain and comply with permits required under such laws, could subject us to significant liability or require costly investigative, remedial or corrective actions. 

In the used vehicle remarketing industry, large numbers of vehicles, including wrecked vehicles at salvage auctions, are stored and/or refurbished at auction facilities and during that time minor releases of fuel, motor oil and other materials may occur. We have investigated or remediated, or are currently investigating or remediating, contamination resulting from various sources, including gasoline, fuel additives (such as methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE), motor oil, petroleum products and other hazardous materials released from aboveground or underground storage tanks or in connection with current or former operations conducted at our facilities. We have incurred, and may in the future incur, expenditures relating to releases of hazardous materials, investigative, remedial or corrective actions, claims by third parties and other environmental issues, and such expenditures, individually or in the aggregate, could be significant. 

Federal and state environmental authorities are currently investigating IAA's role, if any, in contributing to contamination at the Lower Duwamish Waterway Superfund Site in Seattle, Washington. IAA's potential liability, if any, at this site cannot be estimated at this time. See Item 3, "Legal Proceedings" for a further discussion of this matter. 

Management considers the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability, as well as the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. We accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss (or range of possible losses) can be reasonably estimated. Management regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether accrual amounts should be adjusted. Accruals for contingencies including environmental matters are included in "Other accrued expenses" at undiscounted amounts and exclude claims for recoveries from insurance or other third parties. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessment and remediation efforts progress, or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. If the amount of an actual loss is greater than the amount accrued, this could have an adverse impact on our operating results in that period. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , we had a total of approximately 14,400 employees, of which approximately 11,000 were located in the U.S. and approximately 3,400 were located in Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Approximately 74% of our workforce consists of full-time employees. Currently, none of our employees participate in collective bargaining agreements. 

In addition to the employee workforce, we also utilize temporary labor services to assist in handling the vehicles consigned to us and to provide certain other services. Nearly all of our auctioneers are independent contractors. Some of the services we provide are outsourced to third party providers that perform the services either on-site or off-site. The use of third party providers depends upon the resources available at each auction facility as well as peaks in the volume of vehicles offered at auction.
