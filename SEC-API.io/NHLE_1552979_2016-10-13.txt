 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

Nhale Inc. (&#8220;NHLE&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated as GankIt Corporation in the state of Nevada on March 8, 2012, with a fiscal year end of May 31. Until May 12, 2014, we were an e-commerce business focused on selling a diverse set of products through a website that could either be won through a bidding process or purchased at a discount to the suggested retail price. 

&#160;

On May 12, 2014, Riverview Heights, LLC purchased 20,000,000 shares of common stock of the 30,000,000 total issued and outstanding shares common stock of Company, thus becoming the Majority Shareholder (hereafter the &#8220;Majority Shareholder&#8221;). The Majority Shareholder purchased 12,500,000 shares of common stock from Clark Rhode and 7,500,000 shares of common stock from John Arnold.

&#160;

On May 13, 2014 the Majority Shareholder appointed Lance Williams as Sole Director, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company; and concurrently therewith accepted the resignation of John Arnold from his positions of Sole Director, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company. Concurrently the Company filed with the State of Nevada to change its name to Nhale, Inc. to better reflect its revised business model.

&#160;

We have refocused the business plan to production of herbal vaporizer pens and other legal products in the consumer space focusing on the decriminalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes, a significant trend occurring in the U.S. and around the world.

&#160;

OUR PRODUCT

&#160;

Nhale is an herbal vaporizer pen in a convenient multi-use kit. The multi-purpose kit includes everything needed for vaporizing dry leaf herbs, waxes, oils and e-liquids.

&#160;

The company began development of the Nhale brand in June 2014, obtaining the product through and outsourced manufacturer selected and engaged by the Company. 

&#160;

The Nhale vaporizer pen uses vaporizer technology. The unit is discreet, and we believe it may be a healthier alternative to traditional smoking. The Nhale vaporizer pen allows the user to consumer to consume the herbal product without the harmful effects and toxins produced by combustion, and eliminates the danger of second hand smoke. It produces much less odor and can be used in public places. The major benefit of the pen is that it allows the consumer to receive the effects or benefits of smoking the herbal product without the health and social risks involved with smoking. Oils and other viscous liquids can also be used with the optional glass chamber that comes with the kit. The parts are contained in an attractive case for maximum portability.

&#160;

Vaporizer pens consist of three components: A battery, an atomizer and a loadable cartridge or chamber. The battery transfers energy to the atomizer. The atomizer heats the air drawn into the electronic device to a temperature high enough that it vaporizes the active ingredient in the chamber. The vapor is then inhaled into the mouth and lungs simulating the smoking experience and delivering the essential components. The simulated &#8220;smoke&#8221; is simply water vapor that evaporates in a few seconds with little lingering odor.

&#160;

The Nhale vaporizer pen kit is priced competitively with the industry. 

&#160;

BUSINESS STRATEGY

&#160;

The company recognizes two major trends: The increasing adoption of vaporizing and electronic cigarettes, or ecigs, by the world&#8217;s 1billion+ smokers, and the decriminalization of marijuana for medical use. Our efforts are centered on introducing innovative new technologies focusing on both of these market trends.

&#160;

SALES and MARKETING STRATEGY

&#160;

Nhale is committed to developing key partnerships and relationships to help it establish market presence and provided full service marketing, including Internet and social media marketing in support of the product rollout. We are currently working with established retail distributors who will perform the majority of the direct product marketing as part of our agreement with them. The major distributor is Evaps Distribution and Promotions, who has signed several retailers, including 12 retail locations in Houston, Texas.

CHARACTERISTICS AND MAKE UP OF TARGET MARKET

&#160;

Our current market is made up of smokers who are looking for an alternative to traditional cigarettes. In addition, there are currently 23 states that have decriminalized medical marijuana in the U.S. Both trends provide us a large pool of potential customers within two market segments. 

&#160;

BRAND RECOGNITION AND CHARACTERISTICS

&#160;

The Nhale vaporizer is pen comes in a convenient, easy to use multi-use kit. This all-purpose set includes everything needed to vaporize dry herd, waxes, e-liquids, and oils in a convenient carrying case. 

&#160;

Comparable to much higher priced vape pens the Nhale vaporizer features interchangeable parts for dry leaf herbs and a glass chamber for essential oils and concentrates in an elegant, lightweight pen-style vape.

&#160;

COMPETITION

&#160;

There are many ecig companies on the market, many of which are made in China that compete directly in the U.S. market. This creates challenging issues as the manufacturers of these devices are also directly marketing to the customers in our market sector. 

&#160;

Major tobacco companies are currently moving to get ahead of the potential shift in the market by selling e-cigarettes themselves. With deep pockets, intimate knowledge of the market, powerful research and development capability and massive sales and distribution networks, they are in a position to quickly seize the majority of the market. Experts believe that the big companies will market devices that will be likely to win over more smokers.

&#160;

Examples of the major competitive brands that Nhale competes against are:

&#160;

Atmos

Grenco Science

Vaped

Cloud

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

&#160;

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#8217;s Center for Tobacco Products currently does not have authority to regulate the sale or use of e-cigarette devices as tobacco products.

&#160;

Even though the FDA is not regulating e-cigarettes, local and state governments may still adopt laws regulating e-cigarettes, including restrictions on their sale or use.
