Narrative Description of Business 

The company's principal business consists of the research, design, manufacture, selling, and distribution of office furniture systems, seating products, other freestanding furniture elements, textiles, home furnishings and related services. Most of these systems and products are designed to be used together. 

The company's ingenuity and design excellence create award-winning products and services, which has made us a leader in design and development of furniture, furniture systems, and textiles. This leadership is exemplified by the innovative concepts introduced by the company in its modular systems (including Canvas Office Landscape&#8482;&#174;, Locale&#174;, Metaform Portfolio&#8482;&#174;, Public Office Landscape&#8482;&#174;, Layout Studio&#174;, Action Office&#174;, Ethospace&#174;, Arras&#174;, and Resolve&#174;). The company also offers a broad array of seating (including Embody&#174;, Aeron&#174;, Mirra2&#8482;, Setu&#174;, Sayl&#174;, Celle&#174;, Equa&#174;, and Ergon&#174; office chairs), storage (including Meridian&#174; and Tu&#8482;&#174; products), wooden casegoods (including Geiger&#174; products), freestanding furniture products (including Abak&#8482;&#174;, Intent&#174;, Sense&#8482; and Envelop&#174;), healthcare products (including Palisade&#8482;, Compass&#8482;&#174;, Nala&#174;, and other Nemschoff&#174; products) the Thrive portfolio of ergonomic solutions, and the textiles of Maharam Fabric Corporation (Maharam).

The company's products are marketed worldwide by its own sales staff, independent dealers and retailers, its owned dealer network, via its e-commerce website and through its owned retail studios. &#32; Salespeople work with dealers, the architecture and design community, and directly with end-users. Independent dealerships concentrate on the sale of Herman Miller products and some complementary product lines of other manufacturers. It is estimated that approximately 74 percent of the company's sales in the fiscal year ended May 28, 2016 , were made to or through independent dealers. The remaining sales were made directly to end-users, including federal, state, and local governments, and several business organizations by the company's own sales staff, its owned dealer network, Design Within Reach ("DWR") retail studios or independent retailers. 

The company is a recognized leader within its industry for the use, development, and integration of customer-centered technologies that enhance the reliability, speed, and efficiency of our customers' operations.

Raw Materials 

The company's manufacturing materials are available from a significant number of sources within the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia. To date, the company has not experienced any difficulties in obtaining its raw materials. The costs of certain direct materials used in the company's manufacturing and assembly operations are sensitive to shifts in commodity market prices. In particular, the costs of steel, plastic, aluminum components, and particleboard are sensitive to the market prices of commodities such as raw steel, aluminum, crude oil, lumber, and resins. Increases in the market prices for these commodities can have an adverse impact on the company's profitability. Further information regarding the impact of direct material costs on the company's financial results is provided in Management's Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 of this report. 

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Etc. 

The company has active utility patents on various components used in its products and active design patents. Many of the inventions covered by these patents also have been patented in a number of foreign countries. Various trademarks, including the name and stylized &#8220;Herman Miller&#8221; and the &#8220;Herman Miller Circled Symbolic M&#8221; trademark are registered in the United States and many foreign countries. The company does not believe that any material part of its business depends on the continued availability of any one or all of its patents or trademarks, or that its business would be materially adversely affected by the loss of any thereof, except fort the following trademarks: Herman Miller&#174;, Herman Miller Circled Symbolic M&#174;, Maharam&#174;, Geiger&#174;, Design Within Reach&#174;, DWR&#174;, Nemschoff&#174;, Action Office&#174;, Ethospace&#174;, Aeron&#174;, Mirra&#174;, Embody&#174;, Setu&#174;, Sayl&#174;, Eames&#174;, PostureFit&#174;, Meridian&#174;, and Canvas Office Landscape&#174;. It is estimated that the average remaining life of the company's patents and trademarks is approximately 5.5 years . 

Working Capital Practices 

Information concerning the company's inventory levels relative to its sales volume can be found under the Executive Overview &#32;section in Item 7 of this report. Beyond this discussion, the company does not believe that it or the industry in general has any special practices or special conditions affecting working capital items that are significant for understanding the company's business. 

Customer Base 

The company estimates that no single dealer accounted for more than 5 percent &#32;of the company's net sales in the fiscal year ended May 28, 2016 . The company estimates that the largest single end-user customer, the U.S. federal government, accounted for $88 million , $97 million , and $102 million &#32;of the company's net sales in fiscal 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. This represents approximately 4 percent , 5 percent &#32;and 5 percent &#32;of the company's net sales in fiscal 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. The company's 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 18 percent , 20 percent , and 23 percent &#32;of net sales in fiscal 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. 

Backlog of Unfilled Orders 

As of May 28, 2016 , the company's backlog of unfilled orders was $323.5 million . At May 30, 2015 , the company's backlog totaled $322.2 million . The ending backlog of $323.5 million &#32;as of the end of fiscal 2016 included a decrease of approximately $14.0 million related to the divestiture of a dealership in Australia. It is expected that substantially all the orders forming the backlog at May 28, 2016 , will be filled during the next fiscal year. Many orders received by the company are reflected in the backlog for only a short period while other orders specify delayed shipments and are carried in the backlog for up to one year. Accordingly, the amount of the backlog at any particular time does not necessarily indicate the level of net sales for a particular succeeding period. 

Government Contracts 

Other than standard provisions contained in contracts with the United States Government, the company does not believe that any significant portion of its business is subject to material renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of various government entities. The company sells to the U.S. Government both through a General Services Administration ("GSA") Multiple Award Schedule Contract and through competitive bids. The GSA Multiple Award Schedule Contract pricing is principally based upon the company's commercial price list in effect when the contract is initiated, rather than being determined on a cost-plus-basis. The company is required to receive GSA approval to apply list price increases during the term of the Multiple Award Schedule Contract period. 

Competition 

All aspects of the company's business are highly competitive. From an office furniture perspective, the company competes largely on design, product and service quality, speed of delivery, and product pricing. Although the company is one of the largest office furniture manufacturers in the world, it competes with manufacturers that have significant resources and sales as well as many smaller companies. In the United States, the company's most significant competitors are Haworth, HNI Corporation, Kimball International, Knoll, and Steelcase. 

The company also competes in the home furnishings industry, primarily against regional and national independent home furnishings retailers who market high-craft furniture to the interior design community. Similar to our office furniture product offerings, the company competes primarily on design, product and service quality, speed of delivery, and product pricing in this consumer market. 

Research, Design, and Development 

- &#32;4 - 

The company draws great competitive strength from its research, design, and development programs. Accordingly, the company believes that its research and design activities are of significant importance. Through research, the company seeks to define and clarify customers and the problems they are trying to solve. The company designs innovative products and services that address customer needs and solve their problems. The company uses both internal and independent research resources and independent design resources. Exclusive of royalty payments, the company spent approximately $62.4 million , $56.7 million , and $53.9 million &#32;on research and development activities in fiscal 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. Generally, royalties are paid to designers of the company's products as the products are sold and are included in the Design and research line item within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

Environmental Matters 

For over 50 years, respecting the environment has been more than good business practice for us &#8212; it is the right thing to do. Our 10-year sustainability strategy &#8212; Earthright &#8212; begins with three principles: positive transparency, products as living things, and becoming greener together. Our goals are focused around the smart use of resources, eco-inspired design, and becoming community driven. Based on current facts known to management, the company does not believe that existing environmental laws and regulations have had or will have any material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the company. However, there can be no assurance that environmental legislation and technology in this area will not result in or require material capital expenditures or additional costs to our manufacturing process. 

Human Resources 

The company considers its employees to be another of its major competitive strengths. The company stresses individual employee participation and incentives, believing that this emphasis has helped attract and retain a competent and motivated workforce. The company's human resources group provides employee recruitment, education and development, as well as compensation planning and counseling. Additionally, there have been no work stoppages or labor disputes in &#32; the company's history . Approximately 15.6 percent &#32;of the company's employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, most of whom are employees of its Nemschoff, Herman Miller Ningbo, and Herman Miller Dongguan subsidiaries. 

As of May 28, 2016 , the company had 7,607 &#32;employees, representing a 1.3 percent &#32;increase as compared with May 30, 2015 . The increase in employees was driven principally by an increase in workforce within our West Michigan manufacturing facilities. In addition to its employee workforce, the company uses temporary labor to meet uneven demand in its manufacturing operations. 

Information about International Operations 

The company's sales in international markets are made primarily to office/institutional customers. Foreign sales consist mostly of office furniture products such as Abak&#174;, Aeron&#174;, Mirra&#174;, Celle&#174;, Sayl&#174;, Layout Studio&#174;, Arras&#8482;, and other seating and storage products (including POSH products).
