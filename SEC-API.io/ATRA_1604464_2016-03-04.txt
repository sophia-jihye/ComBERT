 Item 1. Business

Overview 

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing meaningful therapies for patients with severe and life-threatening diseases that have been underserved by scientific innovation. We have two groups of product candidates: (a) allogeneic or third-party derived antigen-specific T-cells, and (b) molecularly targeted biologics. 

T-cells are a type of white blood cell. Cytotoxic T-cells, otherwise known as cytotoxic T lymphocytes, or CTLs, have been shown to have the ability to kill cancer cells. Our T-cell product candidates arise from a platform technology designed to produce off-the-shelf, partially human leukocyte antigen, or HLA, matched cellular therapeutics utilizing CTLs. We licensed rights to these product candidates from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, or MSK, in June 2015. Our initial T-cell product candidates target viral- or cancer-specific antigens and are designed to harness the body&#8217;s immune system to counteract specific viral infections and cancers. Our most advanced T-cell product candidate, EBV-CTL, is in Phase 2 clinical trials for malignancies associated with Epstein Barr Virus, or EBV, including EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders, or EBV-PTLD. EBV-PTLD is a cancer affecting some patients who have received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, or HCT, a solid organ transplant, or SOT, or are otherwise immunocompromised. Our second T-cell product candidate, CMV-CTL, is in Phase 2 clinical trials for cytomegalovirus, or CMV, an infection that occurs in some patients who have received an HCT or SOT or are otherwise immunocompromised. Our third T-cell product candidate, WT1-CTL, targets cancers expressing the antigen Wilms Tumor 1, or WT1, and is currently in Phase 1 clinical trials. In addition, we entered into a sponsored research collaboration with MSK to discover and develop additional T-cell product candidates. In October 2015, we entered into exclusive license and research agreements with another academic institution. These agreements enable us to access a technology complementary to that which was licensed from MSK and to pursue development of EBV and CMV-CTLs for other indications such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or NPC, gastric cancer, and multiple sclerosis, or MS. We are working with this academic institution on the submission to the FDA of one or more investigational new drug applications, or INDs, for these new indications.

Our molecularly targeted product candidates are biologics that inhibit myostatin and activin, members of the Transforming Growth Factor-Beta, or TGF-&#223;, protein superfamily, which play roles in the growth and maintenance of muscle and many other body tissues. Our lead molecularly targeted product candidate is STM 434. We commenced a Phase 1 clinical trial of STM 434 for ovarian cancer and other solid tumors in 2014. We have five additional molecularly targeted product candidates that modulate the TGF-&#223; pathway in preclinical development. 

In clinical trials that enrolled patients with EBV-PTLD following HCT or SOT, efficacy following treatment with EBV-CTL compares favorably with historical data in these patient populations. In rituximab-refractory patients with EBV-PTLD after HCT, treatment with EBV-CTL resulted in one-year overall survival of approximately 60% in two separate clinical trials in comparison with historical data where median survival, or the time by which 50% of patients had died, was 16-56 days. In the setting of rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD after SOT, similar results were observed, with one-year overall survival of approximately 60% in EBV-CTL-treated patients in comparison with an expected historical one-year survival of 36% in patients with high risk disease similar to the patients treated in the trials. In February 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, granted breakthrough therapy designation for EBV-CTL in the treatment of rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD after HCT. Breakthrough therapy designation is an FDA process designed to accelerate the development and review of drugs intended to treat a serious condition when early trials show that the drug may be substantially better than current treatment. In June 2015, we met with the FDA to discuss late-stage development to support a potential approval in this indication. Based on guidance from the FDA, we submitted a special protocol assessment, or SPA, for a single arm pivotal trial in rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD after HCT. We received feedback from the FDA regarding this SPA in which the FDA indicated that a single arm trial with response rate as the primary endpoint may provide an adequate basis for approval but it would be unlikely to grant an SPA for our proposed trial. We intend to continue the dialogue with the FDA regarding this trial design under breakthrough designation and expect to initiate this pivotal trial towards the end of 2016. Additionally, we intend to initiate a randomized pivotal trial in patients with EBV-PTLD after SOT towards the end of 2016. In February 2016, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for EBV-CTL for the treatment of patients with EBV-PTLD after HCT or SOT.

Results from ongoing Phase 2 trials of CMV-CTL have demonstrated similar efficacy in the setting of refractory CMV infection after HCT, with response rates exceeding 60% in patients with CMV viremia and disease resistant to multiple approved and investigational anti-viral therapies. We expect to meet with the FDA in the middle of 2016 to discuss late phase development with CMV-CTL to support approval. 

While we evaluate the path to registration for both EBV-CTL and CMV-CTL in these initial indications, we intend to concurrently explore the clinical utility of these T-cell product candidates or other cellular therapies in other relevant disease states to expand their potential applicability. In addition, we believe that T-cells can be directed at a broad range of other targets to create future 

&#160;

product candidates. We believe that viral antigens are well suited to ado ptive immunotherapy given that people with normal immune systems are able to mount robust responses to these viral targets, but immunocompromised patients and some cancer patients are not. 

Our lead molecularly targeted product candidate, STM 434, a soluble ActR2B receptor that binds to Activin A, is in a Phase 1 clinical trial that will enroll approximately 70 patients with ovarian cancer and other solid tumors. In October 2015, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for STM 434 in ovarian cancer, and we believe that novel therapies for clear cell and granulosa cell tumors could qualify for breakthrough therapy designation if supported by appropriate clinical data. Based on its mechanism of action, we also believe that STM 434 has the potential to be the first product to target tumor growth and proliferation through the inhibition of Activin A. STM 434 has a well-characterized mechanism of action and was developed initially, along with our other in-licensed molecularly targeted biologic product candidates, at Amgen, Inc., or Amgen. We are evaluating the remaining five pre-clinical molecularly targeted product candidates to determine the best path forward. Where appropriate, we intend to conduct preclinical studies and file INDs with the FDA for these candidates. 

In December 2015, we announced results from a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for PINTA 745, a molecularly targeted product candidate, for the treatment of protein energy wasting in patients with end stage renal disease. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint, defined as the percent change from baseline in lean body mass as measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at week 12 following weekly treatment with PINTA 745. PINTA 745 also did not improve physical function, measures of glycemic control and markers of inflammation. There were no treatment related serious adverse events observed in the trial. We intend to complete the trial as designed; however, as a consequence of these results, we have suspended further clinical development of PINTA 745. 

Our business model is to license or acquire, develop and commercialize novel therapeutics for serious unmet medical needs with validated targets and established proof of concept. Based on the properties of each of these molecules, including efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, affinity and other characteristics, we match each program to clinical indications that we believe maximize its therapeutic potential and may result in an expedited path to market. We believe our management team has the breadth and depth of experience to execute this model. Our management team includes:

Our T-Cell Product Candidates

T-cells are a critical component of the body&#8217;s immune system and can be harnessed to counteract viral infections and some cancers. By focusing the T-cells on specific proteins involved in cancers and infections, the power of the immune system can be 

&#160;

employed to combat these diseases. In June 2015, we exclusively licensed from MSK worldwide rights to three clinical stage T-cell product candidates. We also have an exclusive option to exclusively license from MSK worldwide rights to certain other T-cell programs that are discovered or developed by MSK pursuant to sponsored research funded by us. 

Our T-cell product candidates arise from a platform technology designed to produce off-the-shelf, cellular therapeutic options for patients with unmet medical needs. Our initial T-cell product candidates target viral- or cancer-specific antigens. In October 2015, we entered into exclusive license and research agreements with another academic institution. These agreements enable us to access a technology complementary to that which was licensed from MSK and to pursue development of EBV and CMV-CTLs for other indications such as NPC, gastric cancer, and MS. We are working with this academic institution on the submission to the FDA of one or more INDs for these new indications.

Our most advanced T-cell product candidate, EBV-CTL, is in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of EBV-associated malignancies. EBV is the virus that causes mononucleosis and is associated with a number of more severe diseases, including certain malignancies and neurologic conditions, such as MS. EBV-CTL received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA in February 2015 for the treatment of patients with rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD after HCT, based on data from two separate clinical trials conducted by MSK. Since licensing our T-cell product candidates, the IND under which these trials were conducted has been transferred to us. In June 2015, we met with the FDA to discuss late-stage development to support a potential approval in this indication. Based on guidance from the FDA, we submitted an SPA for a single arm pivotal trial in rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD after HCT. We received feedback from the FDA regarding this SPA in which the FDA indicated that a single arm trial with response rate as the primary endpoint may provide an adequate basis for approval but it would be unlikely to grant an SPA for our proposed trial. We intend to continue the dialogue with the FDA regarding this trial design under breakthrough therapy designation and expect to initiate this pivotal trial towards the end of 2016. Additionally, we intend to initiate a randomized pivotal trial in patients with EBV-PTLD after SOT towards the end of 2016. In February 2016, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for EBV-CTL for the treatment of patients with EBV-PTLD after HCT or SOT.

Our second T-cell product candidate, CMV-CTL, targets CMV, an infection that can result in blindness, illness or death, depending on the tissue it affects, in those with weakened immune systems. CMV is also associated with certain malignancies, including glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM. CMV-CTL is currently being investigated in Phase 2 clinical trials sponsored and conducted by MSK for CMV infections that occur in some patients who have received an HCT. 

Our third clinical stage T-cell product candidate, WT1-CTL, targets WT1. Abnormal expression of WT1 is seen in a variety of hematologic and solid tumors, including MM, PCL, and ovarian cancer. This product candidate is currently in Phase 1 clinical trials sponsored and conducted by MSK. 

Clinical experience with our T-cell product candidates is broad, including in immunocompromised states, as well as in solid and hematologic malignancies. Clinical data for EBV-CTL, CMV-CTL and WT1-CTL have been published in the journal Blood and presented at major scientific conferences. We are focusing our initial development and &#160; regulatory activities on EBV-CTL in the post-HCT and post-SOT setting and CMV-CTL in the post-HCT &#160; setting, which we believe offer a rapid path to marketing approvals if supported by additional clinical data. However, we intend to concurrently explore the clinical utility of our T-cell product candidates in other relevant disease states. &#160; 

T-cell Technology Platform 

Our T-cell product candidates share a common technology under which T-cells are collected from the blood of third-party donors and then exposed to a selected viral antigen in order to activate them against that particular virus. The resulting activated T-cells are expanded in number, characterized and stored for future therapeutic use in an appropriate partially HLA matched patient, providing an off-the-shelf, cellular therapeutic option for patients. Because these T-cells are off-the-shelf, patients often only need to wait days until they receive treatment. In addition to expanding the activated T-cells, the manufacturing process also leads to substantial reduction in the number of alloreactive cells, which can cause graft versus host disease, or GvHD. We believe this may reduce the risk of GvHD, a serious complication in immunocompromised recipients. 

&#160;

The process through which EBV-CTLs are generated is shown in the diagram below. First, B-cells derived from the blood of a third-party donor are exposed to a specific strain of the EBV virus to create EBV transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines, or EBV BLCLs. The BLCLs are irradiated to prevent the BLCLs from growing and then co-cultured with T-cells derived from the blood of the same third-party donor. In this co-culture process, the BLCLs present EBV antigen to the T-cells to activate the T-cells against the EBV virus. These activated EBV-specific T-cells are then sensitized and expanded, while the potentially alloreactive cells contained in the same culture a re not expanded. When complete, the cultures are assessed for EBV reactivity, HLA restriction, the absence of allo-specificity and microbial sterility. Once fully characterized in this way, the cell lines are cryopreserved and stored for future therapeutic use as an off-the-shelf therapy. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The donor&#8217;s blood contains a mix of T-cells, some that have the potential to target EBV-infected cancer cells, and others called alloreactive or allospecific T-cells, which have the potential to target cells recognized as foreign. Administration of bulk third-party lymphocytes that contain a relatively high proportion of allospecific T-cells has the potential to cause severe and life-threatening toxicities such as GvHD when these allospecific T-cells recognize the recipient&#8217;s native cells as foreign. Our manufacturing process enriches the product for the desired EBV-CTLs while depleting the undesirable allospecific T-cells as they are not stimulated to expand and eventually die. The existing manufacturing process typically results in an approximately 70-fold expansion in the number of EBV-CTLs and reduces by a factor of approximately 20 the number of GvHD-causing allospecific T-cells, compared with the prevalence of these two types of cells in a sample of bulk donor lymphocytes. 

In addition to being evaluated for expansion before release for use in clinical trials, cells are also evaluated for HLA restriction. HLA restriction refers to the fact that any given T-cell line will only recognize such T-cell line&#8217;s target&#8212;in this case an EBV protein&#8212;when it is bound to a particular HLA. For example, an EBV-CTL restricted by a particular HLA known as HLA A*02:01 will only kill EBV-infected cells that show that same EBV protein when bound to HLA A*02:01. This process identifies EBV-CTLs that are specific to the desired target, limiting undesirable off-target killing of other cells. 

An appropriate cell line for use in a particular patient is typically defined as being matched with at least two of eight HLA alleles and restricted through a shared HLA allele. In an analysis conducted by MSK and reported at the 2015 American Association for Cancer Research, or AACR, annual meeting, an appropriate cell line was determined to be available for all but one of 200 consecutive unrelated transplant recipients and 100 cord blood transplant recipients. This analysis was based on evaluating these potential patients against a bank of approximately 330 HLA characterized EBV-CTL lines that MSK had generated to date. MSK&#8217;s clinical experience has yielded an empirically derived, proprietary approach to selecting the appropriate cell line for use in individual patients. We believe this algorithm will ultimately allow us to deliver the therapy efficiently by focusing on a limited set of EBV-CTL lines without compromising our ability to treat a wide range of patients with diverse HLA types. 

A similar process is used to generate and characterize CMV-CTL and WT1-CTL, and we also plan to utilize this process to generate diverse banks of targeted cytotoxic T-cell lines against other antigens of interest.

EBV-Targeted T-Cells for EBV-PTLD and Other EBV Associated Diseases 

EBV is a member of the Herpes virus family and is one of the most common viruses in humans. It is present in all populations, infecting more than 95% of all individuals within the first four decades of life. In healthy individuals, EBV causes infectious mononucleosis, a generally benign self-limiting condition. Following the acute phase of EBV infection, the virus remains present in a small number of B-cells throughout the body; however, it is kept in check by the intact immune system. Though benign in the vast majority of people, EBV has been demonstrated to be involved in the development of many malignancies. In immunocompromised patients, EBV causes lymphomas and other lymphoproliferative disorders, collectively called EBV-PTLD. EBV-PTLD most commonly affects patients after HCT or after SOT. Even in patients with intact immune systems, EBV is associated with various hematologic malignancies and solid tumors including Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma, other B-cell malignancies, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric cancer. EBV is also associated with certain diseases of the central nervous system, including multiple sclerosis. 

The approximate estimated number of patients per year in the United States and European Union with EBV associated diseases is highlighted in the figure below.

EBV-PTLD is a rare but serious complication in recipients of HCT. EBV-PTLD is often severe and sudden in onset and results in death in the majority of HCT patients who develop the disease. A study conducted by the Karolinska Institute that was reported in the journal Haematologica noted a three-year survival rate of just 20%. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, there were 8,338 allogeneic transplants in the United States in 2013, and according to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, there were 14,950 allogeneic transplants in the European Union. While autologous transplants, or those obtained from the same individual, still comprise the majority of all transplants in the United States and European Union, the relative proportion of allogeneic transplants, or those obtained from a third-party donor, has increased over time, and we believe this trend will continue due to the increasing utilization of haploidentical transplants and reduced intensity transplants. 

The monoclonal antibody, rituximab, is typically used off-label to treat EBV-PTLD, producing initial responses in approximately 55% of treated patients and durable responses in approximately 20% of treated patients. However, for those who relapse after rituximab therapy or fail to respond to rituximab, or for those with CD20 negative lymphoma (which is known to be unlikely to respond to rituximab), EBV-PTLD is frequently lethal. For example, it was reported in 2014 in the journal Bone Marrow Transplantation that the median survival period from diagnosis of rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD in adult HCT patients was 33 days, and in 2014 it was reported in the journal Haematologica that median survival was 16 days. In 2008, it was reported in the journal Bone Marrow Transplantation that the median survival period from the time of diagnosis in a group of EBV-PTLD patients who received rituximab was 56 days. Taken together, these studies suggest a range of median overall survival, or OS, in the setting of rituximab failure of 16-56 days. &#160; 

MSK is conducting two separate clinical trials of EBV-CTL that enroll a heterogeneous group of patients with a variety of EBV-associated malignancies, including, but not limited to, EBV-PTLD after HCT and EBV-PTLD after SOT. These trials are referred to as Study 95-024, initiated in 1995, and Study 11-130, initiated in 2011. Results from these two trials supported the granting of breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for EBV-CTL in February 2015 for the treatment of rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD after HCT. Data from these trials was presented at a clinical trials plenary session at the April 2015 AACR Annual Meeting and was subsequently updated at an oral presentation at the June 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, Annual Meeting. 

In Study 95-024, patients with EBV-PTLD following HCT were treated with EBV-CTL manufactured from T-cells derived from either the primary HCT donor or an unrelated third-party donor. The term primary HCT donor refers to the donor who provided hematopoietic stem cells for the HCT. As one measure of efficacy, response rate was evaluated in these patients. The response rate refers to the proportion of patients treated with EBV-CTL who had either a complete or partial response as best response to treatment when measured by radiographic imaging of the tumor. In a complete response, no visible evidence of tumor following treatment was observed. In a partial response, the tumor was reduced in size by more than 50% but less than 100%. 

&#160;

In both the primary HCT donor and third-party donor cohorts, similar response rates of approximately 60% were achieved. Such response rates suggest that the efficacy of treatment with primary donor derived and third-party donor derived EBV-CTL are comparable. The si milarity in efficacy observed following treatment with third party and primary donor derived EBV- CTL is important, as there are significant limitations associated with a therapy derived from the primary transplant donor. First, it can take approximately e ight weeks to generate an EBV-CTL line from blood remaining from the primary HCT donor. In this amount of time and based on historical data, approximately half of those patients who had either failed to respond or who had relapsed after rituximab would lik ely have succumbed to their EBV-PTLD and died before the cell line was available for therapeutic use. Second, due to the limited quantities of certain HCT donor materials such as umbilical cord blood, it is not possible to make a primary donor derived EBV- CTL line for all patients. Additionally, if the EBV-PTLD is of host rather than donor origin, T-cells derived from the primary HCT donor may not be able to recognize this host tumor, and therefore would not be expected to be effective in combatting the dis ease. Thus, we believe that the availability of off-the-shelf third-party derived EBV-CTL provides significant practical and therapeutic advantages in the treatment of rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD. A median of two cycles of third-party derived EBV-CTL wer e administered in these trials. In each cycle, three doses of EBV-CTL were given weekly for three weeks. In addition, a number of patients with disease located in the central nervous system, or CNS, responded to treatment with EBV-CTL, suggesting that thes e cells are capable of passing through the blood-brain barrier. 

The OS for patients with rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD after HCT following treatment with third-party derived EBV-CTL was evaluated by MSK as well as presented at ASCO 2015 using industry standard Kaplan Meier, Or K-M, methods. One-year OS was approximately 60% in the patients from Study 95-024 and approximately 70% in the patients from Study 11-130. 

Since these trials are ongoing, we expect that these K-M estimates of survival will evolve with ongoing follow-up of the patients and that a median OS may be reached in Study 11-130. However, we believe that these results compare favorably with the historically reported median survival of 16-56 days in the setting of rituximab failure. Moreover, patients who achieve a complete response after EBV-CTL treatment have been noted by MSK to experience durable remissions without relapse of their EBV lymphoma. 

The time course of a complete response following multiple cycles of EBV-CTL in a patient with rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD is shown below using sequential positron emission tomography, or PET, scans. Also shown are the timing of rituximab and EBV-CTL therapy depicted by the corresponding set of arrows, the levels of EBV DNA in the blood as measured by EBV polymerase chain reaction, or EBV PCR, a sensitive and specific technique to detect viral DNA depicted in the corresponding line, as well as the levels of CTL precursors per milliliter of blood, or CTLp/ml, depicted in the corresponding line. CTLp/ml identifies and enumerates activated T-cells. 

&#160;

&#160;

This patient developed EBV viremia, or high levels of virus in the blood, early post-HCT as noted in the line labeled EBV PCR. Her viremia responded to rituximab, but recurred and it again responded to a second cycle of rituximab. In the interim, she developed a rapidly progressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, that was EBV positive. By week 0, defined as the start of EBV-CTL therapy, the lymphoma is visible in the lymph nodes as well as in the liver and spleen. She received a first cycle of third party EBV-CTL after which she had a partial response. The patient received three subsequent cycles of EBV-CTL after which she achieved a complete response. In conjunction with each cycle of EBV-CTL, expansion of EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cells was detected, as shown 

&#160;

in the line labeled CTLp/ml. While these expansions were not durable, they mediated her complete response. The PET scans, in which dark areas correspond to areas of high metabolic activity, s how both normal metabolism of organs such as the heart and abnormal metabolism in areas of lymphoma. After treatment with T-cells, the abnormal areas of metabolism recede, indicating eradication of tumor cells. In the final image, no abnormal metabolic act ivity is observed, reflecting a complete response to EBV-CTL therapy. 

The ability to switch from one cell line to another led to the discovery of a hierarchy of HLA restriction. This is highlighted by the example below, in which a patient received three EBV-CTL lines (A, B and C) with different HLA restrictions, but only went into complete response upon administration of a fourth unique EBV-CTL line (D) with a different HLA restriction. We believe that future patients can be treated using a cell line selection algorithm based in part on the hierarchy elucidated in this manner that enables a more efficient choice of EBV-CTL. 

&#160;

&#160;

Across all patients enrolled in the two trials, reports of treatment related adverse events were low, with few possibly related grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events observed. One patient developed grade 1 skin GvHD responding to topical steroids with no systemic therapy required. No infusion related toxicities or cytokine release syndrome was observed. 

In part due to these results, treatment with EBV-CTLs is recognized as a recommended treatment for persistent or progressive EBV-PTLD as set forth in the 2015 National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines. In addition, in December 2013, the FDA granted MSK cost reimbursement for use of the EBV-CTL in MSK&#8217;s clinical trials. 

Since licensing our T-cell product candidates, the IND under which Studies 95-024 and 11-130 were conducted has been transferred to us. In June 2015, we met with the FDA to discuss late-stage development to support a potential approval in EBV-PTLD after HCT. Based on guidance from the FDA, we submitted an SPA for a single arm pivotal trial in rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD after HCT. We received feedback from the FDA regarding this SPA in which the FDA indicated that a single arm trial with response rate as the primary endpoint may provide an adequate basis for approval but it would be unlikely to grant an SPA for our proposed trial. We intend to continue the dialogue with the FDA regarding this trial design under breakthrough therapy designation and expect to initiate this pivotal trial towards the end of 2016. 

EBV-PTLD after SOT 

EBV-PTLD after SOT, also referred to as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, is a spectrum of lymphoid malignant disease associated with the use of immunosuppressive drugs after SOT. Patients with EBV-PTLD, one of the most common neoplastic diseases after SOT, commonly present with stage 3 or 4 disease. Reduction in immunosuppression, antiviral therapy, or surgical resection are common treatments, but many patients with PTLD require systemic therapy, especially those with aggressive lymphoma morphology such as DLBCL. Chemotherapy remains undesirable in PTLD because of myelotoxic side effects of cytotoxic therapy and associated infections and toxic deaths. In addition, recipients of chemotherapy face the prospect of secondary malignancies in the future. Rituximab with or without chemotherapy is often used off-label after reduction in immunosuppressive therapy with a response rate of 44% to 60.5%. In the setting of rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD after SOT, historical one-year survival of 36% is observed in patients with high risk disease. The rates of EBV-PTLD after SOT vary by organ transplant type and degree of immunosuppression with rates in the adult and pediatric settings ranging from &#60;1% to 3.4% in kidney transplants, &#60;1% to 4.4% in liver transplants, &#60;1% to 15.0% in heart transplants, 2.4% to 9.8% in lung transplants, 2.0% to 10.0% in heart/lung transplants, and 20.0% to 30.0% in bowel 

&#160;

transplants. In addition, the rates of EBV-PTLD after SOT appear to be higher in children than in adults. One of the uniqu e features of EBV-PTLD after SOT in comparison with the post-HCT setting is that the immunosuppression that ultimately gives rise to the lymphoma is in many cases required chronically and, as a result, the period of time during which an EBV-associated lymp homa may arise extends for the duration of immunosuppression. Although some cases of EBV-PTLD in SOT occur within the first year, many occur years after transplant. 

In trials 95-024 and 11-130, patients with EBV-PTLD after SOT were treated with third-party derived EBV-CTL. All patients had failed to respond to or relapsed following rituximab treatment. Most had also progressed after receiving chemotherapy. Additionally, nearly all patients had high risk disease defined as those with age greater than or equal to 60 years, poor performance status, elevated LDH, or presence of disease in the central nervous system, or CNS. Response rate and OS results for these patients were also evaluated by MSK. 

The response rate observed in the rituximab-refractory post SOT setting of greater than 50% and the one-year OS of approximately 60% are similar to those observed in the post HCT setting. 

Since these trials are ongoing, we expect that these K-M estimates of survival may evolve with ongoing follow-up of the patients. Based on this data, we plan to solicit feedback from the regulatory authorities on the plan for late-phase development to support a potential marketing approval for EBV-CTL in the treatment of EBV-PTLD after SOT. 

Other EBV-Associated Diseases 

EBV-associated malignancies can occur even in immunocompetent patients, and include: Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma such as DLBCL, or NHL, NK T-cell lymphomas, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or NPC, and gastric cancer. Typically, these malignancies occur many years after primary EBV infection. For Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma, approximately 15% to 30% of cases in the United States and European Union are associated with EBV. For Hodgkin lymphoma, approximately 20% to 50% of cases in the United States and European Union are associated with EBV; however, many of these are responsive to chemotherapy. Nearly 100% of NK T-cell lymphomas are associated with EBV. In NPC, the association with EBV is such that regardless of geography nearly 100% of the nonkeratinising tumors and all the tumor cells have been demonstrated to be monoclonally EBV-positive. EBV-positive gastric cancer can make up approximately 10% of all gastric cancers. In some of these tumor types, multiple EBV proteins are associated with the disease and in others, a smaller subset are made. 

In the setting of CNS disease, a number of observations implicate EBV in the pathogenesis of MS. For example, MS patients are universally EBV seropositive, there are high levels of anti-EBV antibodies, their T-cells have altered immune function, there is an increase in spontaneous EBV-induced peripheral blood B-cell transformation, there is increased shedding of EBV from saliva, and EBV-infected B-cells and plasma cells accumulate in the brain. 

We intend to explore the therapeutic utility of EBV-targeted cellular therapy in a number of these tumor types. We expect to develop specific cellular therapies that target the precise EBV antigen implicated in a disease. As we expand the use of EBV-targeted cellular therapy in these settings, we expect to present data at major scientific meetings and engage regulatory authorities to solicit agreement on the plan for late-phase development to support a marketing approval for EBV-CTL in the treatment of certain of these conditions. 

CMV-Targeted T-cells for CMV Infection and Other CMV Associated Malignancies 

CMV, also known as HHV-5, is a member of the Herpes virus family. CMV infection rate gradually increases throughout childhood, and, once infected, an individual carries the virus for life due to the ability of CMV to establish a latent state of infection. It is estimated that CMV infection affects 50% to 90% of the global adult population. Immunocompromised patients, including HCT and SOT patients, human immunodeficiency, or HIV, patients, and to a lesser extent cancer patients, are at highest risk for developing significant disease syndromes caused by CMV, including interstitial pneumonia, gastrointestinal infection, central nervous system disease, hepatitis, retinitis, and encephalitis. CMV reactivations have also been reported to occur frequently in critically ill immunocompetent patients and are associated with prolonged hospitalization or death. Congenital CMV infection causes deaths and leaves children with permanent disabilities such as hearing loss, vision loss, or mental retardation. 

In the oncology setting, CMV is commonly associated with glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM, where approximately 95% of tumors express CMV. In GBM, multiple CMV proteins are associated with the disease. 

While there have been many advances in detecting and managing CMV infections, the virus continues to be one of the most important infectious diseases among immunocompromised patients. Antiviral drugs in the form of prophylaxis or preemptive 

&#160;

treatment strategies have reduced morbidity and mortality, though adverse effects such as neutropenia and toxicity remain a challenge. The emergence of resistance to antiviral drugs also presents challenges to laboratory medicine and patient car e. 

The approximate estimated number of patients per year in the United States and European Union with refractory CMV infection and associated malignancies is highlighted in the figure below.

CMV Viremia and Disease after HCT 

Despite the use of prophylactic and preemptive therapy using small molecule antivirals, many post-HCT patients progress to develop overt, symptomatic CMV viral diseases such as retinal infections that risk permanent blindness, encephalopathy with the risk of permanent brain damage and other serious morbidities. In prophylactic therapy, immunocompromised patients are given antiviral drugs for several months after HCT. In preemptive therapy, patients are intensively monitored for CMV activity using sensitive laboratory methods, and short-term antiviral treatment is given only to those with significant viral counts (CMV viremia) before symptoms and overt CMV disease occur. However, the antiviral drugs used to treat CMV have significant toxicities, including marrow toxicity for ganciclovir, valganciclovir and cidofovir, and renal toxicity for foscarnet and cidofovir. In addition, CMV drug resistance mutations arise during this antiviral therapy. 

MSK has conducted one Phase 1 clinical trial and two Phase 2 clinical trials of CMV-CTL that included patients with CMV viremia and CMV disease, in each case resistant to antiviral drug treatment. An interim summary of MSK&#8217;s clinical experience was reported at the December 2014 ASH Annual Meeting. This analysis evaluated outcomes in patients who were treated with CMV-CTLs after failing a median of four different antiviral drugs. Following the ASH presentation, in January 2015, MSK provided us with a more current summary of its clinical experience to account for additional cycles of CMV-CTL therapy in which certain patients with stable disease and partial responses from the interim summary had converted to complete responses after additional CMV-CTL therapy. Response rates of greater than 60% were noted in patients with antiviral resistant CMV viremia as well as CMV disease. Responses in patients treated for viremia alone with CMV-CTLs were considered to be complete responses if the viremia resolved completely and partial responses if the viral load fell 100-fold or more. Responses in patients treated for overt disease were considered to be complete responses if all detectable CMV viremia and disease resolved and partial responses if patients became asymptomatic.

An additional subset analysis of MSK&#8217;s clinical experience from the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial and including patients treated under compassionate use was reported at the December 2015 ASH Annual Meeting. This analysis included patients with refractory CMV disease in the CNS who were treated with either primary donor derived or third-party derived CMV-CTL. Nearly all of these patients were treated with third-party derived CMV-CTL and one was treated with a primary donor derived CMV-CTL. Patients had received a range of three to six prior therapies before treatment with CMV-CTL. The overall response rate was more than 70%, including seven complete responses and one partial response. Responses in these patients treated for CMV disease in the CNS were considered to be complete responses if all detectable CMV viremia and disease resolved and partial responses if patients became asymptomatic.

We believe this data suggests a high response rate among patients with otherwise refractory CMV viremia and disease. Overall, CMV-CTL therapy was well tolerated and no patients developed de novo GvHD, or a flare-up of prior GvHD, in association with infusion of CMV-CTLs. &#160; 

&#160;

Two individual patient experiences following treatment with CMV-CTL are described below. The graph below shows the time course of a reduction in CMV viremia and a rec iprocal increase in the proliferation of CMV-CTL following administration. The improvement in CMV viremia is evidenced by a decline in blood CMV DNA ascertained by CMV PCR. The reciprocal proliferation of CMV-CTL following administration is reflected by th e release of interferon-gamma (IFNg[+]) in CMV-CTL detected via flow cytometry; interferon-gamma positivity identifies and enumerates activated T-cells. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The following retinal photographs depict improvement in CMV retinitis for a patient treated with CMV-CTL. The baseline images, labeled &#8220;a&#8221; and &#8220;b&#8221;, show the right and left retinae, respectively, at the start of CMV-CTL administration. Subsequent images &#8220;c&#8221; and &#8220;d&#8221; capture the response of the patient&#8217;s CMV retinitis at six weeks after first CMV-CTL administration. In the retinal images, the dark areas correspond to affected portions of the retina. The response of retinal disease to treatment with CMV-CTL suggests that, as was observed with EBV-CTL, the cells are able to reach areas of the body typically not accessible to systemic therapies. 

&#160;

&#160;

Based on these results, we intend to continue to support the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials of CMV-CTL and meet with health authorities to establish a plan for late-phase development to support potential marketing approvals in treatment of anti-viral resistant CMV viremia and symptomatic disease after HCT, including retinitis.

Other CMV-Associated Conditions and Malignancies 

CMV is among the most common and important infectious agents among SOT patients. In transplant recipients, the factor that most strongly influences the degree of morbidity and mortality caused by CMV is the type and extent of immunosuppressive therapy. Reactivation can occur in any individual who is latently infected. However, no transplant patient is safe from CMV since this pathogen can also be acquired from the transplanted organ. CMV can also be community acquired following transplantation and is of particular concern in pediatric transplant patients. In SOT patients, particularly those who develop a primary infection during the first three months post-transplant, a specific CMV syndrome consisting of fever, malaise, arthralgia, and neutropenia may be observed. CMV infections have been associated with indirect effects, such as dysfunction or rejection of the transplanted organ; increased risk for bacterial or fungal opportunistic infections; development of EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder; 

&#160;

accelerated atherosclerosis in heart transplant patients; and decreas ed patient and graft survival. In the absence of antiviral intervention, symptomatic CMV infections occur in approximately: 50% to 75% of heart-lung transplant recipients, 23% of heart transplant recipients, 22% to 29% of liver and pancreas transplant reci pients, 8% to 32% of kidney transplant recipients, 50% of kidney-pancreas transplant recipients, and 22% of small-bowel transplant recipients. 

Malignant gliomas are the most common primary CNS neoplasms in humans. However, most patients who are diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme, which is the most common and malignant form of malignant glioma, still have a mean survival less than two years. In the last few years, multiple investigators have confirmed the presence of CMV in GBM, and multiple CMV gene products are now implicated in biologically relevant GBM signaling pathways. Preclinical studies published in 2013 in the journal Cancer Research indicate that CMV may be unique in its ability to promote oncogenesis in the setting of a prior tumor suppressor dysfunction. Given the emerging role of CMV in GBM, antiviral strategies that block CMV expression or stimulate immune attack of CMV-infected cells may prove beneficial as novel therapeutics for GBM, and both direct antiviral strategies and specific CMV-based immunotherapy approaches are showing early promise. 

Based on the established proof of concept for CMV-CTL in the treatment of antiviral resistant CMV viremia and disease after HCT, we intend to explore the therapeutic utility of CMV-targeted cellular therapy in a number of other immunocompromised states, including potentially after SOT. In addition, the clinical data with both EBV-CTL and CMV-CTL have demonstrated the ability of these product candidates to access the brain and mediate clinical responses in difficult to treat CNS disease. As a result, we believe that CMV-targeted cellular therapy may provide a novel off-the-shelf cellular therapeutic option for patients with GBM, and we intend to explore its clinical utility in this setting as well. As we expand the use of CMV-CTL in these settings, we expect to present data at major scientific meetings and engage regulatory authorities to solicit agreement on the plan for late-phase development to support potential marketing approval for CMV-CTL in the treatment of certain of these conditions.

WT1 Targeted T-Cells for Hematologic Malignancies and Solid Tumors 

WT1 is an intracellular protein that is overexpressed in a number of cancers, including multiple myeloma, or MM, and non-small cell lung, breast, pancreatic, ovarian, and colorectal cancers. We have two ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials sponsored and conducted by MSK with primary HCT donor derived WT1-CTL. The first is a dose escalation trial of WT1-CTL for residual or relapsed leukemia after HCT. The second is a dose escalation trial of WT1-CTL following T-cell depleted HCT for patients with relapsed or refractory MM, including PCL. In 2011, it was reported in the journal Blood that the prognosis of PCL is poor with a median survival of seven to eleven months and that survival is even shorter, two to seven months, when PCL occurs in the context of refractory or relapsing MM. At the ASH 2015 Annual Meeting, MSK presented results from this Phase 1 clinical trial of primary donor-derived WT1-CTLs. In this trial, response assessments were conducted utilizing criteria consistent with those defined by the International Myeloma Working Group.

&#160;

&#183; 

Patients with relapsed-refractory MM, including PCL were treated with allogeneic HCT followed by WT1-CTLs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

At one year, a response rate of greater than 50% was observed in these patients. For these data, the response rate was determined by adding the complete responses to the partial responses and then dividing by the number of patients. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Two patients who developed a complete response remain in remission for more than one year. 

&#160;

&#183; 

There were no serious adverse events reported related to treatment with WT1-CTLs. 

As these trials complete, we expect our collaborating investigators at MSK to present additional data at upcoming conferences. In addition, based on data from these trials, we expect to explore the clinical utility of WT1-CTL in these hematologic malignancies. In the setting of solid tumors, we believe that treatment with WT1-CTL may be potentiated through combination approaches with other agents. 

Additional Platform Expansion Activities 

We anticipate that our T-cell technology platform will have utility beyond the current set of targets to which it has been directed. We and MSK have agreed to collaborate on further research to develop additional cellular therapies, which may include T-cell programs targeted against other antigens and chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR-T, cell programs. Pursuant to the existing agreements with MSK, we have an option to license these additional cellular therapies. We believe that viral antigens are well suited to adoptive immunotherapy given that people with normal immune systems are able to mount robust responses to these viral targets, but immunocompromised patients and some cancer patients are not. We also intend to license or acquire additional product candidates or technologies to enhance our existing T-cell technology platform. 

&#160;

Our Molecularly-Targeted Product Candidates 

STM 434, a Targeted Therapy for Ovarian Cancer and Other Solid Tumors 

Our lead molecularly targeted product candidate, STM 434, is in a Phase 1 clinical trial in ovarian cancer and other solid tumors, which commenced in 2014. In October 2015, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for ovarian cancer. STM 434 is a soluble ActR2B receptor-IgG fusion protein that binds the signaling molecule human activin. STM 434 has the potential to be the first product to target tumor growth and proliferation by inhibiting multiple ActR2B ligands, including Activin A. A ligand is a protein that binds a receptor on a cell to trigger a signal. In ovarian cancer, Activin A is a novel and promising target. Published data, including a study in Clinical Cancer Research in 2008, as well as our preclinical data, suggest that Activin A is upregulated in patients with ovarian cancer, and blocking it reduces proliferation of tumor cells. In many solid tumor types, upregulation of Activin A is correlated with poorer prognoses. &#160; 

Ovarian Cancer 

Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. According to the National Cancer Institute, there were an estimated 22,192 new ovarian cancer cases and 14,180 ovarian cancer deaths in the United States in 2015. Surgery and cytotoxic chemotherapies are widely used to treat ovarian cancer; however, the outcomes have changed little in 40 years. There were estimated to be approximately 192,500 women suffering from ovarian cancer in the United States in 2012. According to the American Cancer Society, based on patients diagnosed between 2005 and 2011, the blended five-year survival rate is only 45.6% for ovarian cancer patients overall. 

Ovarian cancers are divided into three distinct main subtypes: 

&#160;

&#183; 

serous adenocarcinoma, which accounts for approximately 63% of ovarian tumors in the United States; 

&#160;

&#183; 

clear cell cancers, which account for up to 11% of ovarian tumors in Western countries and a higher percentage in Asian countries. For example, clear cell cancers have been reported to account for approximately 23% of ovarian tumors in Japan; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

granulosa cell tumors, which account for approximately 2% to 5% of ovarian tumors in the United States. 

Limitations of Current Therapies for Ovarian Cancer 

Despite the strong unmet need for better therapies, there have been few new treatment options introduced, and numerous studies, including a 2012 study published in Obstetrics &#38; Gynecology , have shown that clinical outcomes have not improved significantly for several decades. The number of new cases and deaths in the United States per 100,000 people (all races), age-adjusted, is as follows:

&#160;

&#160;

First Line Treatment 

Surgical therapy for ovarian cancer that has not escaped the ovary can be curative. In other cases, palliative debulking surgery is done. However, for women with advanced or recurrent tumors that have escaped the ovary and involve critical anatomic structures, there are no curative therapies, and chemotherapy is generally employed. When chemotherapy is indicated, treatment for these subtypes vary but are generally based on a foundation of platinum chemotherapy. Response rates and outcomes vary among subtypes. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Serous tumors have a reported response rate to chemotherapy of 72% to 73%, according to a 2005 study in the journal Clinical Cancer Research ; however, most patients relapse, resulting in a median survival of approximately 40.8 months, according to a 2010 publication in the International Journal of Gynecological Cancer . 

&#160;

&#183; 

Clear cell tumors have a platinum-based chemotherapy response rate of approximately 11% as reported in a 2006 study in the British Journal of Cancer . Median overall survival in patients with clear cell tumors is approximately 21.3 months. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The data on post-surgery response rates to chemotherapy in the granulosa subtype of ovarian cancer is limited due to its rarity. 

Recurrent Disease Treatment 

For patients whose tumors did not respond to first line therapy, or for those whose tumors became unresponsive to platinum chemotherapy, a number of other chemotherapy options may be applied, including liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan and gemcitabine. Despite these therapies, the median survival of platinum chemotherapy resistant ovarian cancer is approximately 13 months . 

Role of Activin A in Ovarian Cancer and Other Solid Tumors 

Activin A, a secreted growth factor, is a member of the TGF-&#223; superfamily of growth factors, which also includes Activin B, Activin AB, GDF-11 and others. Activin A is widely understood to be involved in the growth and proliferation of ovarian cancer and other solid tumors. Some of the other secreted proteins in this superfamily, including Activin AB, have also been implicated in the growth of these tumors. As reported in BMC Medical Genomics in 2010, overexpression of Activin A in support cells called stroma is a key component of a metastasis-associated gene expression signature. This signature predicts shortened survival across a number of cancers including, ovarian, gastric and breast cancers. Overexpression of Activin A is now recognized as a common feature across advanced solid tumors including head and neck, colon, gastric, esophageal, pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer. In addition to their role in regulating interactions between epithelial cells and stromal cells, activins may be involved in regulating stem cell survival. &#160; 

Activin A has been found to play a role in the three principal subtypes of ovarian cancer: serous, clear cell and granulosa. For example, the mRNA precursor for activin has been found to be upregulated in approximately 30% of specimens of serous ovarian cancer. At the protein level, as published in 1997 in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism , most typical serous ovarian cancers made serum Activin A. &#160; 

Many women with ovarian cancer have high levels of Activin A. The utility of high Activin A in ovarian cancer will be explored in the currently ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial. 

Genetic Linkages to Ovarian Cancer Subtypes 

Mutations in the BRCA gene have been found in 5% to 10% of serous ovarian tumors, suggesting that there is a genetic link between the activin pathway and ovarian cancer. According to a 2012 publication in the journal PloS One , these patients with BRCA mutations fail to produce the Activin A counter-regulators follistatin and inhibin, implying that these tumors may be unable to switch off activin signaling. &#160; 

In clear cell ovarian cancer, studies have shown that mutations in the ARID1A gene contribute to tumor proliferation. Specifically, these mutations drive upregulation in the signaling cascade triggered by the ActR2B receptor. Mutations in the ARID1A gene were present in 46% and 55% of ovarian clear cell tumors, as reported in a 2010 publication in The New England Journal of Medicine and a 2014 publication in BMC Cancer , respectively. We believe that increased levels of activin mimic the effect of ARID1A mutations, and therefore play a similar role in clear cell ovarian cancer. &#160; 

In granulosa cell ovarian cancer, mutations in the FOXL2 C134W gene have been suggested in several studies to drive the growth of tumors. This mutation was present in 97% of granulosa cell tumors as reported in a 2009 publication in The New England Journal of Medicine . In a normal cell, activin is under tight control&#8212;FOXL2 protein turns on follistatin when an activin signal is received, and follistatin, a natural inhibitor of activin, then shuts off the activin signal. However, in granulosa cell tumors, mutant FOXL2 C134W is not able to turn on follistatin, and activin signals continue unchecked. These studies have been reported in 2014 in 

&#160;

the journal Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications as well as in 2013 in the journal Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology . &#160; 

Mechanism of Action of STM 434 

We believe that STM 434 has the potential to be the first product to address directly the underlying biology of ovarian tumors. 

Activin A is known to act through the ActR2B receptor on the surface of ovary cells. When the receptor receives the signal from Activin A, it initiates a cascade of gene transcription that leads to abnormal cell proliferation, cell migration, blood vessel formation and inhibition of programmed cell death. STM 434 is a ligand trap, which mimics the ActR2B receptor, binding Activin A and other ligands that would normally activate this receptor. Several ligand traps based on other receptors have been developed as therapeutic products and commercialized successfully. The choice of a ligand trap for STM 434 conforms mechanistically with the goal of binding Activin A and other secreted proteins associated with the ActR2B receptor and tumor growth. 

Preclinical Studies 

Preclinical testing of STM 434 was designed to confirm and quantify its effects in binding Activin A and other ligands with a receptor-like ligand trap. These studies were conducted with STM 217, a close analog of STM 434, which we refer to as STM 434/s. In addition, these studies were carried out in two types of mouse models: TOV-21G mice, which are analogous to patients with clear cell ovarian tumors and carry ARID1A mutations, and inhibin knockout mice, which are analogous to patients with granulosa cell tumors. 

Results of the TOV-21G study have shown that blocking Activin A by using a soluble receptor, as both a single therapy and in combination with chemotherapy, led to a reduction in tumor size. In other experiments, knockout mice that were born without inhibin, and therefore had high activin levels that led to granulosa cell ovarian tumors, survived longer after treatment with STM 434/s in comparison to untreated mice. A 2007 publication in the journal Molecular Human Reproduction showed that the survival of the knockout mice was greatly improved when they were treated with an ActR2B-Fc fusion similar to STM 434. Other mouse tumor models tested, including renal cell carcinoma, melanoma and small cell lung cancer, were shown to be sensitive to activin levels and antitumor responses were seen when activins were inhibited. 

TOV-21G Mouse Models (Clear Cell Ovarian Tumors) 

In a preclinical study using TOV-21G mice, tumors derived from human clear cell ovarian carcinoma were shown to have high levels of serum Activin A, analogous to those observed in human ovarian cancer patients as described above. 

In a subsequent preclinical study that we presented together with Amgen at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in 2013, we evaluated STM 434/s in this TOV-21G model used as both a single agent and in combination with the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil, or 5-FU. STM 434/s was administered subcutaneously weekly at 10.0 mg/kg beginning on day 12. 5-FU was administered for three cycles. The tumor was measured two to three times per week, up to day 52. Results from these experiments showed a statistically significant (p&#60;0.0001) approximately 30% reduction in tumor volume for the agent. Results of the combination experiments demonstrated in the figure below showed an additive (p&#60;0.0001) approximately 70% reduction in tumor growth. 

&#160;

Additive Effect with 5-FU 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, this study examined the anticachectic effects of STM 434/s in this model. Cachexia is a condition associated with significant weight loss often seen in patients with solid tumor cancers. The results of this study showed that the administration of STM 434/s increased body weight of the mice. In addition to demonstrating the antitumor properties of STM 434/s, we believe that this data also demonstrates that an ActR2B soluble receptor may provide an additional benefit to patients by addressing cancer cachexia. We intend to investigate these attributes as part of our planned Phase 1 clinical trial. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Inhibin Knockout Mouse Model (Granulosa Cell Tumors) 

For granulosa cell studies, a knockout mouse model was used with STM 434/s. The study showed that serum Activin A levels in the knockout mice were elevated, and upon treatment with STM 434/s Activin A levels were significantly reduced. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

STM 434/s treatment reduced the elevated circulating Activin A in the inhibin knockout mice to the levels in control mice. Serum Activin A was measured before and 14 days after treatment. 

Further, this study showed that treatment with STM 434/s reduced ovary size to near normal in comparison to control mice treated with saline. A representative example of the observed reduction in size is shown below. In this study, STM 434/s was administered as a single dose of 30 mg/kg. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Lastly, the knockout model treated with STM 434/s showed a statistically significant (p&#60; 0.0001) improvement in survival with approximately 90% alive at 133 days of age, as compared to knockout mice treated with saline, where more than 95% had died by this time. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In July 2014, Amgen provided us a draft report from a 2009 eight-week pharmacology study of STM 217, a compound closely related to STM 434 and which we also refer to as STM 434/s, in orchiectomized (neutered) male cynomolgus monkeys. This pharmacology study was designed to explore the ability of STM 217 to reverse the effects of androgen deprivation. In the study, two weekly doses of STM 217 were evaluated at 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg. The study found that STM 217 was effective in mitigating the muscle and bone loss that accompany androgen deprivation in this animal model. 

In addition to the muscle and bone effects, clinical observations from the study included bleeding from the muzzle (similar to human nosebleeds) in some of the monkeys and one animal bleeding from a skin lesion over the buttock. In this study, it was not possible to determine if the bleeding was caused by STM 217. To further characterize this observation, we performed additional in vitro studies of STM 217 and STM 434. Platelets, a component of blood that helps stop bleeding, were evaluated, and neither STM 217 nor STM 434 impacted platelet function. We also evaluated BMP-9, a factor involved in bleeding and blood vessel development known to be mutated in humans with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, or HHT. Both STM 217 and STM 434 bound to BMP-9 in these studies, suggesting that the bleeding observed with STM 217 could also be observed with STM 434. The observations from the STM 217 report and the in vitro studies we conducted have been shared with the FDA. 

As a result of these findings with STM 217, we altered our STM 434 Phase 1 clinical trial protocol to exclude patients at heightened risk of bleeding and enhance the monitoring of patients for bleeding or increased risk for bleeding. These changes were also shared with the FDA. 

Phase 1 Clinical Trial in Ovarian Cancer and Other Solid Tumors 

We commenced an open-label Phase 1 clinical trial of STM 434 in 2014 that will enroll approximately 70 patients. The initial dosing schedule for this trial was once every four weeks. This trial is being conducted in three parts: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Part 1 &#8212; Dose escalation trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. Dosing initiated at 0.25 mg/kg. We plan to test up to the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD. Assuming no MTD is reached, we will test ascending doses of STM 434. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Part 2 &#8212; Designed to obtain additional safety and exploratory efficacy data in patients with advanced ovarian cancer, including clear and granulosa cell tumors. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Part 3 &#8212; Designed to study STM 434 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with ovarian cancer who have received prior treatment. 

The objectives for our Phase 1 clinical trial are: to test if STM 434 monotherapy is safe and well tolerated; to obtain preliminary efficacy data in ovarian cancer and other solid tumors; to assess safety and preliminary efficacy of STM 434 with liposomal doxorubicin chemotherapy or the current standard of care; and to explore biomarkers predictive of response to treatment. Further objectives include collecting pharmacokinetic data during therapy with STM 434 and defining the recommended Phase 2 dose. 

&#160;

Since initiating this trial in October 2014, we have continued to dose and enroll patients. Bleeding has been observed in a subset of patients. Some of these bleeding events were deemed by the treating investigators to be possibly relat ed to treatment with STM 434. Following review of these events by the safety committee, consisting of the trial sponsor and the trial investigators, the associated doses were deemed safe and well tolerated, and the trial is continuing at escalating doses. 

Based on data supporting the role of activin in the progression of other solid tumors and the inclusion criteria, we expect that a number of patients included in the dose escalation portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial will have solid tumors in organs other than the ovary. Other tumors may include pancreas, stomach and kidney tumors, where there is a high correlation between Activin A upregulation and the severity and outcome of disease. We expect to release initial data from this Phase 1 clinical trial in the first half of 2016. 

Biomarker Approach 

Activin expression is one of a few biomarkers associated with severity in a variety of tumors including ovarian tumors. For this reason, Activin A is one of 12 genes that are measured in colon cancer as part of the clinically validated OncotypeDX &#174; colon cancer panel. Our Phase 1 clinical trial is testing whether high levels of Activin A measured at baseline before patients receive STM 434 predict whether they respond to treatment. If levels of Activin A can predict response, this biomarker may be valuable in late-phase trials to improve the trial design and maximize the proportion of patients who respond to STM 434. 

In addition, we will be measuring follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH, levels using a routine laboratory test, to determine the inhibition of activin by STM 434. It is well established that activin negatively regulates FSH, and we therefore can use FSH reduction as a surrogate for activin inhibition. We also plan to conduct ARID1A and FOXL2 mutation testing in our Phase 1 clinical trial. These mutations have been associated with tumor proliferation. 

PINTA 745 for PEW in ESRD

In December 2015, we announced results from the a Phase 2 pro of-of-concept clinical trial for PINTA 745, a molecularly targeted product candidate, for the treatment of protein energy wasting in patients with end stage renal disease. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint, defined as the percent change from baseline in lean body mass as measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at week 12 following weekly treatment with PINTA 745. PINTA 745 also did not improve physical function, measures of glycemic control and markers of inflammation. There were no treatment related serious adverse events observed in the trial. We intend to complete the trial as designed; however, as a consequence of these results, we have suspended further clinical development of PINTA 745. 

Molecularly Targeted Product Candidate Pipeline 

Our molecularly targeted product candidate pipeline currently consists of five product candidates that were licensed from Amgen in addition to STM 434. The product candidates in this portfolio are closely related to one another in terms of the biology and align with our in-house expertise regarding development, manufacturing, intellectual property strategy and other critical activities. These products share association with the TGF-&#223; superfamily of growth factors. At the same time, they represent distinct modes of intervention with potentially different therapeutic applications. These distinctions relate to target specificity, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships and modality. We believe these product candidates have unique characteristics, and, in some cases, demonstrated activity in preclinical studies, which would make them attractive candidates for various indications, including cancer cachexia, a condition that is implicated in up to 30% of cancer deaths with limited existing treatments. We are evaluating these product candidates to determine the best path forward taking into account the results from the PINTA 745 Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial. Where appropriate, we intend to conduct preclinical studies and file IND applications with regulatory authorities for these candidates. 

Our molecularly targeted product candidate pipeline licensed from Amgen includes the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

ATA 777 , a fully human antibody targeting Activin A, which we believe will be well suited for non-oncology indications where chronic dosing and specificity to Activin A is beneficial; 

&#160;

&#183; 

ATA M43 , a fully human anti-ActR2A/2B monoclonal antibody with high affinity to both receptors that is mechanistically similar to programs targeting muscle wasting diseases; 

&#160;

&#183; 

STM 217 , a soluble ActR2B receptor-IgG Fc fusion protein and a close analog of STM 434; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

ActR2B5 , a soluble ActR2B receptor that can be fused to an IgG Fc receptor; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

ATA 842 , a humanized antibody targeting myostatin, designed to be more selective than similar programs in the clinic targeting oncologic, orthopedic and renal indications. 

&#160;

Competition 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our innovative technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and public and private research institutions. Some of these potential competitors may have a more established presence in the market and significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. 

T-Cell Product Candidates 

Should our T-cell product candidates be approved for use, we will face substantial competition. In addition to the current standard of care for patients, commercial and academic clinical trials are being pursued by a number of parties in the field of immunotherapy. Early results from these trials have fueled continued interest in immunotherapy. In addition, if approved, our T-cell programs would compete with currently marketed drugs and therapies used for treatment of the following indications, and potentially with drug candidates currently in development for the same indications.

EBV-PTLD 

There are currently no FDA or EMA approved products for the treatment of EBV-PTLD. However, some approved products and therapies are currently used off-label in this setting, and a number of companies and academic institutions that may license therapies to companies in the future are or may be developing new treatments. These therapies, as well as promotional efforts by competitors and clinical trial results of competitive products, could significantly diminish any ability to market and sell EBV-CTL. The current treatment for EBV-PTLD involves administration of rituximab as a single agent or in the SOT setting, in combination with chemotherapy regimens. Additionally, a number of companies and academic institutions are developing drug candidates for EBV-PTLD, including Cell Medica Ltd., or Cell Medica, which is conducting Phase 2 clinical trials for Cytorex EBV, an autologous EBV specific T-cell therapy, in NK/T-cell lymphoma. 

CMV Infection 

There are numerous approved products and therapies for the treatment of CMV infection, and a number of companies and academic institutions that may license therapies to companies in the future are or may be developing new treatments for CMV infection. These therapies, as well as promotional efforts by competitors and clinical trial results of competitive products, could significantly diminish any ability to market and sell the CMV-CTL. Drug therapies approved or commonly used for CMV infection include antiviral compounds such as ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. 

Additionally, a number of companies and academic institutions are developing drug candidates for CMV infection and other CMV-associated diseases, including Shire plc, or Shire, which has completed Phase 2 clinical trials of maribavir, a UL97 protein kinase inhibitor; Merck &#38; Co., Inc., or Merck, which is conducting Phase 3 clinical trials of letermovir, a CMV terminase inhibitor; Vical Inc., or Vical, which is conducting Phase 3 clinical trials for ASP0113, a bivalent plasma DNA CMV vaccine; and ViraCyte, which is conducting Phase 1 clinical trials for Viralym-C, a CMV-specific third party cell therapy product. Chimerix, Inc., or Chimerix, recently announced that brincidofovir, a lipid conjugated nucleotide analogue of cidofovir, did not meet the primary endpoints of its Phase 3 trials for the prevention of CMV infection in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. 

Multiple Myeloma including Plasma Cell Leukemia

Several products are approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, including Kyprolis (marketed by Amgen Inc.), Revlimid and Pomalyst (marketed by Celgene Corporation), Velcade (marketed by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and Darzalex &#174; (marketed by Janssen Research &#38; Development, LLC). In addition, a number of companies and institutions are developing drug candidates for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, including: AB Science SA, which is conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial for masitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor; and Adaptimmune Therapeutics PLC, which is conducting Phase 1 / 2 clinical trials for a TCR candidate targeting NY-ESO-1.

Molecularly Targeted Product Candidates

If approved, STM 434 would compete with currently marketed drugs and therapies used for treatment of the following indications, and potentially with drug candidates currently in development for the same indications. 

&#160;

Ovarian Cancer 

There are numerous approved products and therapies for ovarian cancer, and a number of companies are or may be developing new treatments for ovarian cancer and other solid tumors. These therapies, as well as promotional efforts by competitors and clinical trial results of competitive products, could significantly diminish any ability to market and sell STM 434. Approved drug therapies for ovarian cancer include chemotherapy with platinum compounds such as cisplatin or carboplatin and taxane compounds such as paclitaxel or docetaxel; bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy compound such as liposomal, doxorubicin, paclitaxel or topotecan; olaparib in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy; and hormone therapies including goserelin, leuprolide, tamoxifen, letrozole, anastrozole and exemestane. 

We are aware of other companies engaged in clinical development of compounds for treatment of ovarian cancer. These include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

PARP inhibitors such as Tesaro, Inc.&#8217;s niraparib; 

&#160;

&#183; 

angiogenesis inhibitors, such as F. Hoffman-La Roche&#8217;s bevacizumab (Avastin); 

&#160;

&#183; 

VEGFr tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH&#8217;s nintedanib and AstraZeneca plc&#8217;s recentin; 

&#160;

&#183; 

selective 17,20-lyase inhibitors such as Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.&#8217;s TAK-700; 

&#160;

&#183; 

anti-folates such as Eisai Co. Ltd.&#8217;s farletuzumab; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

other therapies in development, including those from GlaxoSmithKline plc, Amgen and Clovis Oncology, Inc. 

License Agreements 

MSK Option and License Agreement 

In September 2014, we entered into an exclusive option agreement with MSK under which we acquired the right to exclusively license from MSK the worldwide rights to three clinical stage T-cell programs. The initial option period was for 12 months. In exchange for the exclusive option, we paid MSK $1.25 million in cash and issued 59,761 shares of our common stock to MSK. We and MSK also agreed to collaborate on further research to develop additional cellular therapies, which may include T-cell programs targeted against other antigens and/or CAR-T, and which we also would hold an option to license, if developed. 

In June 2015, we exercised the option and entered into a license agreement with MSK. Under the terms of the license agreement, MSK granted us a worldwide, exclusive license under certain patent rights, know-how and a library of T-cells and cell lines, to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize T-cell products specific to CMV, EBV or WT1 that comprise or are based on or made using such licensed rights. MSK also agreed to transfer certain INDs related to the licensed products to us. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed products and, if commercialized, continue active marketing efforts for any commercialized licensed product through the term of the license agreement. 

In connection with the option exercise and the execution of the license agreement, we made an upfront cash payment to MSK of $4.5 million. We are obligated to make additional milestone payments of up to $33.0 million with respect to the three licensed clinical stage T-cell programs based on achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales-related milestones. We are also required to make escalating mid to high single-digit royalty payments to MSK based on sales of any licensed products. In addition, under certain circumstances, we must make certain minimum annual royalty payments to MSK, which are creditable against earned royalties owed for the same annual period. We are also obligated to pay a low double-digit percentage of consideration we receive for sublicensing the licensed rights. 

The license agreement expires for each licensed T-cell product on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis and a country-by-country basis, on the latest of: (i) expiration of the last licensed patent rights related to such licensed product in such country, (ii) expiration of any market exclusivity period granted by law with respect to such licensed product in such country, and (iii) a specified number of years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product in such country. Upon expiration of the license agreement, the licenses granted to us will become non-exclusive royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable. MSK may terminate the license agreement if we materially breach the agreement and does not cure such breach within a specified period or if we experience certain insolvency events. 

Amgen License Agreements 

In September 2012, we entered into two license agreements with Amgen under which Amgen granted us worldwide exclusive licenses under certain Amgen patent rights and regulatory filings, and non-exclusive licenses under certain Amgen know-how, to 

&#160;

develop and commercialize products comprising certain of Amgen&#8217;s proprietary compounds known as AMG 777, AMG 434, AMG 217, ActR2B5, AMG 842 and M43. We now refer to AMG 777 as ATA 777, AMG 434 as STM 434, AMG 217 as STM 217 and AMG 842 as ATA 842. We have the right, subject to certain limitations, to grant sublicenses under such licensed intellectual property, in connection with licensing the covered products. 

Under both of these license agreements, we are responsible for the worldwide development and commercialization of the licensed products, at our cost, are required to use commercially reasonable efforts with respect to such development and commercialization activities, and must meet certain specific diligence obligations. In exchange for these licenses, we issued 410,256 shares of Series A-1 convertible preferred stock. Each of the 410,256 shares of Series A-1 convertible preferred stock converted into one share of common stock immediately prior to completion of our initial public offering. We are obligated to make payments to Amgen upon the achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones totaling up to $81.5 million for each license agreement , as well as escalating low to mid-single-digit royalties based on sales of the licensed products by us, our affiliates or our sublicensees. We hold the first right to file, prosecute, maintain and enforce all licensed rights under these licenses throughout the world, and Amgen retains certain step-in rights. 

Both license agreements with Amgen, unless terminated earlier, will continue on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last to expire of all royalty obligations we owe to Amgen, which will occur on the later of (a) the date on which exploitation of a licensed product is no longer covered by a valid claim of a patent under the agreement which covers the product in an applicable country, (b) the loss of regulatory exclusivity in such country, or (c) 10 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in such country. Upon expiration of each agreement, we retain non-exclusive rights to the relevant licensed Amgen intellectual property. Amgen may terminate either agreement if we materially breach the agreement and do not cure such breach in a specified notice period, for a failure of our specified diligence obligations, if we experience certain insolvency events, or if we or our sublicensee challenge the patentability, validity or enforceability of any of the Amgen patents licensed under the applicable agreement. We may terminate each agreement for Amgen&#8217;s uncured material breach, or if our board of directors concludes that, due to safety, efficacy, marketability, patent coverage or competition concerns, the development or commercialization of the relevant licensed product is no longer commercially practicable for us. 

Intellectual Property 

Patents 

Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing US and non-US patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Additionally, we expect to benefit from a variety of statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe and other countries that relate to the regulation of biosimilar molecules and orphan drug status. These statutory frameworks provide certain periods of regulatory exclusivity for qualifying molecules. See &#8220;Government Regulation.&#8221; 

We seek composition-of-matter and method-of-treatment patents for each of our product candidates in key therapeutic areas. 

Our in-licensed and proprietary patent estate, on a worldwide basis, is very large and consists of over 100 issued patents and 200 pending patent applications. These figures include in-licensed patents and patent applications to which we generally hold exclusive commercial rights. 

Individual patents extend for varying periods of time depending on the date of filing of the patent application, the priority date claimed and the legal term of patents as determined by the applicable law in the countries in which those patents are obtained. 

Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period; however, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. In addition, patent term adjustments can extend term to account for certain delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, during prosecution before that office. The duration of non-US patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically, a patent&#8217;s life is 20 years from the earliest international filing date. Our licensed, issued US patents are expected to expire on dates ranging from 2027 to 2029, and our licensed issued non-US patents are expected to expire on dates ranging from 2023 to 2029, exclusive of possible patent term extensions. Our pending owned and licensed applications with respect to our product candidates, if issued, are expected to expire, as to applications filed in the United States, on dates ranging from 2023 to 2035, and, as to applications filed in jurisdictions outside the 

&#160;

United States, on dates ranging from 2023 to 2035, exclusive of possible patent term extensions or adjustments. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product- by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of extensions of patent term, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 

National and international patent laws concerning protein-based biologics such as our products remain highly unsettled. No consistent policy regarding the patent-eligibility or the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date among the United States, Europe and other countries. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that may be granted in our patents or in third-party patents. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our product candidates and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims for any patent and enforcing those claims once a patent is granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of any drug we may develop from our product candidates, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. The patent positions for our product candidates are summarized below: 

T-cell Technology Patent Portfolio 

We hold exclusive rights to one pending US provisional patent application directed to EBV-CTL methods of use claims, one pending US provisional patent application directed to CMV-CTL method of use claims, and two pending US provisional patent applications directed to WT1-CTL method of use claims. In addition, we have exclusively licensed MSK&#8217;s rights under two pending provisional applications directed to CMV-CTL method of use claims for treatment of CMV retinitis in HIV-infected patients and SOT recipients, which are co-owned by MSK and another entity from which we have not licensed rights. We also hold exclusive rights to one pending international patent application, one pending Argentine patent application, and one pending Taiwanese patent application, all directed to methods of identifying and selecting allogeneic T-cell lines for therapeutic use. The United States patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications. A provisional patent application is not examined for patentability by the USPTO and automatically expires 12 months after its filing date. As a result, a provisional patent application cannot mature into a patent. Provisional patent applications are often used, among other things, to establish an early effective filing date for a later-filed non-provisional patent application. A non-provisional patent application is examined by the USPTO and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards for patentability. 

STM 434 Patent Portfolio 

We hold exclusive rights to four issued US patents directed to STM 434 relating to composition-of-matter and related methods of use claims, and issued patents or pending patent applications related to STM 434 in many jurisdictions worldwide, including in the United States, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Botswana, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Algeria, the Eurasian Patent Office, Egypt, the European Patent Office, the Gulf Cooperation Council, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, India, Jordan, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Libya, Morocco, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Tunisia, Taiwan, Ukraine and Vietnam. The expected expiration dates for these patents and patent applications range from 2026 to 2035, exclusive of possible patent term extensions or adjustments. 

Trade Secrets 

In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed by an employee. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or any unauthorized disclosure of our proprietary information. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

Overview of US Government Regulation 

The preclinical studies and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and sales, among other things, of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, pharmaceutical products are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. We expect STM 434 to be regulated by the FDA as a biologic and to be reviewed by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Protein therapeutics require the submission of a biologics license application, or BLA, and approval by the FDA prior to being marketed in the United States. Manufacturers of protein therapeutics may also be subject to state regulation. 

Our T-cell product candidates, including EBV-CTL and CMV-CTL, are regulated by the FDA as biologics, reviewed by the Center for Biological Evaluation and Research, and will require the submission of BLAs and approval by the FDA prior to being marketed in the United States. For CTL trials conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documents must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or the OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or the NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA. However, many companies and other institutions, not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines, voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the recombinant DNA advisory committee, or RAC, that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC&#8217;s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public.

Failure to comply with FDA requirements, both before and after product approval, may subject us or our partners, contract manufacturers, and suppliers to administrative or judicial sanctions, including FDA refusal to approve applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, fines and/or criminal prosecution. 

The steps required before a biologic may be approved for marketing of an indication in the United States generally include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to good laboratory practices, or GLP, and other applicable regulations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence; 

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish that the biological product is &#8220;safe, pure and potent&#8221;, which is analogous to the safety and efficacy approval standard for a chemical drug product for its intended use; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of a BLA; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with applicable current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP and in the case of our T-cell product candidates, good tissue practices, or GTP; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA review of the BLA and issuance of a biologics license. 

Before conducting studies in humans, laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the biologic candidate must be conducted. Preclinical toxicology studies in animals must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the preclinical testing, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase or phases of the clinical trial lend themselves to an efficacy determination. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA within the 30-day time period places the IND on clinical hold because of safety concerns about the product candidate or the conduct of the trial described in the clinical protocol included in the IND. The IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. 

All clinical trials for new drugs and biologics must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified principal investigators in accordance with GCP. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the applicable phase of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors must also report to the FDA, within certain timeframes, serious and unexpected adverse 

&#160;

reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator&#8217;s brochure, or any findings f rom other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution, approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject&#8217;s legal representative, and monitor the trial until completed. 

Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap and different trials may be initiated with the same product candidate within the same phase of development in similar or differing patient populations. 

Phase 1 clinical studies may be conducted in a limited number of patients or healthy volunteers, as appropriate. The product candidate is initially tested for safety and, as appropriate, for absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. 

Phase 2 usually involves trials in a larger, but still limited, patient population to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product candidate for specific, targeted indications to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks. 

Phase 3 trials are undertaken to further evaluate clinical efficacy of a specific endpoint and to test further for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing might not be completed successfully within any specific time period, if at all, with respect to any of our product candidates. Results from one trial are not necessarily predictive of results from later trials. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. A sponsor may request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. An SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins for an SPA to be approved. Even if the FDA agrees to the design, execution and analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under the SPA process, the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement if public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment or the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy has been identified after testing has begun. An SPA does not guarantee that a trial will be successful or will in fact be accepted by FDA as sufficient for approval.

The results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product candidate for a proposed indication. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act the fees payable to the FDA for reviewing a BLA, as well as annual fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products, can be substantial but are subject to certain limited deferrals, waivers and reductions that may be available. The fees typically increase each year. Each BLA submitted to the FDA for approval is reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days following receipt by the FDA of the application. If the BLA is found complete, the FDA will file the BLA, triggering a full review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. The FDA&#8217;s established goal is to review 90% of priority BLA applications within six months after the application is accepted for filing and 90% of standard BLA applications within 10 months of the acceptance date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA, however, may not approve a product candidate within these established goals and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. Further, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, may not be an actual approval but a &#8220;complete response letter&#8221; that describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved. Before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the facility complies with cGMP. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if applicable statutory or regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing or information, which can extend the review process. FDA approval of any application may include many delays or never be granted. If a product is approved, the approval may impose limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed, may require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, may require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, and may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. The FDA must approve a BLA supplement or a new BLA before a product may be marketed for other uses or before certain manufacturing or other changes may be made. Further post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product is required. Also, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or manufacturing problems occur following initial marketing. In addition, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. 

&#160;

Under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA, a statutory pathway has been created for licensure, or approval, of biological products that are biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, earlier biological products l icensed under the Public Health Service Act. Also under the BPCIA, innovator manufacturers of original reference biological products are granted 12 years of exclusivity before biosimilars can be approved for marketing in the United States. The implementati on of an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products is under the direction of the FDA and is currently being developed. The FDA has issued several draft guidances for industry related to the BPCIA, addressing scientific, quality and procedural is sues relevant to an abbreviated application for a biosimilar product. The approval of a biologic product biosimilar to one of our products could have a material adverse impact on our business as it may be significantly less costly to bring to market and ma y be priced significantly lower than our products. 

Both before and after the FDA approves a product, the manufacturer and the holder or holders of the BLA for the product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight. For example, quality control and manufacturing procedures must conform, on an ongoing basis, to cGMP and GTP requirements, as applicable and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with these standards. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to maintain compliance. 

Orphan Drug Act 

The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States at the time of application for orphan drug designation. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the holder of the approval is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product except in very limited circumstances. For example, a drug that the FDA considers to be clinically superior to, or different from, another approved orphan drug, even though for the same indication, may also obtain approval in the United States during the seven-year exclusive marketing period. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the drug. 

Legislation similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted outside the United States, including in the EU. The orphan legislation in the EU is available for therapies addressing chronic debilitating or life-threatening conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons or are financially not viable to develop. The market exclusivity period is for ten years, although that period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. The market exclusivity may be extended to 12 years if the sponsor completes a pediatric investigation plan agreed upon with the relevant committee of the EMA. 

Expedited Review and Approval 

The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for developing and reviewing promising drugs, or to provide for the approval of a drug on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of 10 months. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to confirm the clinically meaningful outcome as predicted by the surrogate marker trial. 

In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs discussed above, the FDA also provided guidance on breakthrough therapy designation. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for 

&#160;

accelerated approval. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy prod uct candidate receives: intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and rolling review. 

Companion Diagnostics

If levels of Activin A can predict response, this companion diagnostic biomarker may be valuable in late-phase trials to improve the trial design and maximize the proportion of patients who respond to STM 434. Companion diagnostics are regulated as medical devices. Diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. If use of companion diagnostic is essential to safe and effective use of a drug or biologic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic contemporaneously with the approval of the therapeutic product. The FDA has generally required companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain approval of a PMA for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of a cancer therapeutic involves coordination of review by the FDA&#8217;s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and by the FDA&#8217;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.

Reimbursement 

In both domestic and foreign markets, sales and reimbursement of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. In addition, there is significant uncertainty regarding the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, the payors may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 

Within the United States, if we obtain appropriate approval in the future to market any of our current product candidates, we may seek approval and coverage for those products under Medicaid, Medicare and the Public Health Service, or PHS, pharmaceutical pricing program and also seek to sell the products to federal agencies. 

Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, manufacturers are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation. 

Medicare is a federal program administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that do not need to be administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the US government and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time-to-time. 

Medicare Part B covers most injectable drugs given in an in-patient setting, and some drugs administered by a licensed medical provider in hospital outpatient departments and doctors&#8217; offices. Medicare Part B is administered by Medicare Administrative Contractors, which generally have the responsibility of making coverage decisions. Subject to certain payment adjustments and limits, Medicare generally pays for Part B covered drugs based on a percentage of manufacturer-reported average sales price. 

Drug products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS. 

FFS participation is required for a drug product to be covered and paid for by certain federal agencies and for coverage under Medicaid, Medicare Part B and the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended to not exceed the price that a manufacturer charges its most-favored non-federal customer for its product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject 

&#160;

to a cap on pricing (known as the &#8220;federal ceiling price&#8221;) and may be subject to an additional discount if pricing increases more than inflation. 

To maintain coverage of drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, manufacturers are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS. 

The United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which included changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. Adoption of other new legislation at the federal or state level could further limit reimbursement for pharmaceuticals. Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our products will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved health care products. Recent budgetary pressures in many European Union countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. 

Foreign Regulation 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we expect to be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 

Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country&#8217;s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed in that country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements. 

Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. 

As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 11 years of exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product. 

Additional Regulation 

We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and 

&#160;

waste generated by, our operations. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and viruses. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed ou r resources. 

There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biological products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system of the United States. It is uncertain what legislative proposals will be adopted or what actions federal, state or private payers for medical goods and services may take in response to any healthcare reform proposals or legislation. We cannot predict the effect medical or healthcare reforms may have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect. 

Manufacturing 

Our initial strategy is to outsource the manufacturing of drug substance and drug product for our preclinical studies and clinical trials. We also outsource fill-finish, packaging, labeling, storage, shipping and distribution. This allows us to rapidly conduct manufacturing activities for multiple programs in parallel. It also allows us to balance the requirements of multiple programs and avoid costly investment in manufacturing infrastructure and personnel before clinical data are available. Our internal capabilities and experience in the manufacturing of protein therapeutics encompass a broad range of activities including cell line development, process development, analytical development, formulation development, clinical and commercial scale GMP manufacturing, quality control and quality assurance. We have less substantial internal technical expertise in the manufacture of cellular therapeutics; however, we are currently building those capabilities through our ongoing hiring activities. This breadth of experience allows us to effectively oversee and direct the activities of our contract manufacturers and testing facilities. In selecting contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to manufacture our product candidates, we generally strive to select the CMO based on the particular technical needs of the product candidate. In addition, we aim to work with CMOs that possess the requisite scale, expertise and experience to support clinical as well as commercial product manufacturing. Although this approach, when coupled with the range of CMO capabilities, requires us to utilize multiple CMOs in the manufacturing of our product candidates, we believe it may also mitigate the need for costly and time-consuming process transfers later in development. Ultimately, we believe that our outsourced model and approach to CMO management will allow us to efficiently scale our manufacturing processes to support our current clinical development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates. As our product candidates progress towards potential marketing approvals, we may choose to build or acquire through other means our own manufacturing facilities in order to maintain more substantial control over our supply chain. 

Our EBV and CMV-CTL product candidates require blood from healthy, consenting third-party donors as starting materials. The manufacturing process involves co-culturing and incubating viral or cancer specific antigen transformed B-cells collected from the blood of third party-donors with T-cells collected from the same donor, all under GTPs. GTPs are FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. 

Pursuant to our June 2015 license agreement with MSK, we acquired the right to use certain manufacturing process know-how related to producing clinical research-related drug supply. This included materials to support the manufacturing of clinical trial material including key starting materials and intermediates as well as existing inventory of clinical trial materials. We have entered into an agreement with a CMO to develop and manufacture our EBV-CTL. We are currently in the process of transferring the manufacturing processes from MSK to our CMO. We have also entered into a supply agreement with a third party to ensure we have the necessary blood donated from healthy consenting third-party donors. The transfer of manufacturing processes to our CMO will include modifications to the processes to suit the CMO&#8217;s facility and capability constraints, improvements in the manufacturing process as well as product comparability testing. Moreover, we will also need to develop commercial-scale manufacturing processes for the EBV-CTLs for the planned pivotal trials, with the proposed dose and schedule to be used in clinical practice and at a cost sufficient to support profitable commercialization. We and our CMOs may be required to make further investments to manufacture product for commercialization, including potentially the construction or acquisition of a wholly-owned manufacturing facility. Our other T-cell product candidates are currently manufactured by MSK using readily available raw materials and established manufacturing procedures.

Our lead molecularly targeted product candidate, STM 434, is manufactured using readily available raw materials and established manufacturing procedures. STM 434 is produced in bioreactors using hamster ovary cells that have been genetically 

&#160;

engineered to produce this specific product candidate. All of our other molecularly targeted product candidates, other than PINTA 745, will also be produced in bioreactors using mammalian cells. 

Concurrent with the license of our existing molecularly targeted product candidates from Amgen, we acquired certain manufacturing process know-how related to producing clinical research-related drug supply. In the case of STM 434, this included GMP materials to support the manufacturing of clinical trial material. We have already transferred the downstream elements of the STM 434 manufacturing process to a CMO, and we have initiated transfer of the upstream components of the STM 434 manufacturing process to a CMO. We are also developing a refrigerated liquid formulation of the STM 434 drug product. We and our CMOs will be required to make further investments to manufacture product for pivotal studies, as well as for commercialization, including potentially the construction or acquisition of a wholly-owned manufacturing facility. In the case of our earlier stage molecularly targeted product candidates, this know-how was more limited in scope, as these product candidates were pre-master cell bank in stage of development at the time of licensing. 

Employees 

As of February 15, 2016, we had 55 employees. All of our personnel are co-employees of Atara and TriNet, a professional human resource service organization. Under our agreement with TriNet, TriNet is a co-employer of our personnel, and is responsible for administering all payroll functions, including tax withholding, and providing health insurance and other benefits for these individuals. We reimburse TriNet for these costs and pay TriNet a fee for its services. We are responsible for, and control, all aspects of the hiring, retention, compensation, management and supervision of our personnel. We consider the terms of our contract with TriNet to be reasonable and customary and believe this arrangement provides substantial benefit to us, in the form of lower costs for employee benefits and reduced administrative burden on us.
