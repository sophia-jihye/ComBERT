Recent Developments 

&#160;

Developments During 2015 

&#160;

&#9679; &#160; Reduced Reliance on Quota Share Reinsurance 

&#160;

Effective July 1, 2015, KICO reduced the ceding percentage for its personal lines quota share reinsurance treaty from 55% gross quota share to 40% net quota share. The reduction of the ceding percentage allows KICO to retain a higher portion of its premiums. 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; Implemented Electronic Content Management and Workflow System 

&#160;

In July 2015, KICO implemented Vertafore&#8217;s ImageRight&#174; software, an insurance industry leading electronic content management and workflow system. The new software enhancement has streamlined underwriting and claims processes, allowing for greater efficiency and increased production to support KICO&#8217;s continued growth . 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; Expanded Licensing to Additional States 

&#160;

In 2015, KICO expanded its ability to write property and casualty insurance by obtaining licenses to write insurance policies in New Jersey, Connecticut and Texas. 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; A.M. Best Rating 

&#160;

In 2015, the A.M. Best rating for KICO was upgraded from B+ (Good) to B++ (Good). 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; Increased Rate of Dividends Declared 

&#160;

In November 2015, we increased the quarterly dividends on our common stock from $.05 per share to $.0625 per share. 

&#160;

Dividends of $.05 per share were declared on each of February 6, 2015, May 12, 2015 and August 11, 2015 and were paid on March 13, 2015 and June 15, 2015 and September 14, 2015, respectively. A dividend of $.0625 per share was declared on November 10, 2015 and was paid on December 14, 2015. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Developments During 2014 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; Reduced Reliance on Quota Share Reinsurance 

&#160;

In May 2014, KICO notified its personal lines reinsurers of its election to reduce the ceding percentage for its personal lines quota share reinsurance treaty from 75% to 55% effective July 1, 2014. It was this ability of KICO to retain a higher portion of its premiums that was a prime factor in proceeding with the December 2013 underwritten public offering. 

&#160;

Effective July 1, 2014, KICO non-renewed its commercial lines reinsurance treaty (excluding commercial auto), which consists of small business and artisans risks. KICO had previously ceded 25% of commercial lines written premiums to quota share reinsurers. 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; Increased Rate of Dividends Declared 

&#160;

In August 2014, we increased the quarterly dividends on our common stock from $.04 per share to $.05 per share. 

&#160;

Dividends of $.04 per share were declared on each of February 19, 2014 and May 13, 2014 and were paid on March 14, 2014 and June 13, 2014, respectively. Dividends of $.05 per share were declared on each of August 12, 2014 and November 12, 2014 and were paid on September 15, 2014 and December 12, 2014, respectively.

Business 

&#160;

Property and Casualty Insurance 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Generally, property and casualty insurance companies write insurance policies in exchange for premiums paid by their customers (the &#8220;insureds&#8221;). An insurance policy is a contract between the insurance company and its insureds where the insurance company agrees to pay for losses suffered by the insured that are covered under the contract. Such contracts often are subject to legal interpretation by courts, often involving legislative actions and/or arbitration. Property insurance generally covers the financial consequences of accidental losses to the insured&#8217;s property, such as a home and the personal property in it, or a business&#8217; building, inventory and equipment. Casualty insurance (often referred to as liability insurance) generally covers the financial consequences related to the legal liability of an individual or an organization resulting from negligent acts and omissions causing bodily injury and/or property damage to a third party. Claims for property coverage generally are reported and settled in a relatively short period of time, whereas those for casualty coverage can take years and even decades to settle. 

&#160; 

We generate revenues from earned premiums, ceding commissions from quota share reinsurance, net investment income generated from our investment portfolio, and net realized gains and losses on investment securities. We also receive installment fee income, fees charged to reinstate a policy after it has been cancelled for non-payment, and fees for placing premium finance contracts with a third party licensed premium finance company. Earned premiums represent premiums received from insureds, which are recognized as revenue over the period of time that insurance coverage is provided (i.e., ratably over the life of the policy). A significant period of time can elapse between the receipt of insurance premiums and the payment of insurance claims. During this time, KICO invests the premiums, earns investment income and generates net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses on investments. 

&#160; 

Insurance companies incur a significant amount of their total expenses from policyholder losses, which are commonly referred to as claims. In settling policyholder losses, various loss adjustment expenses (&#8220;LAE&#8221;) are incurred such as insurance adjusters&#8217; fees and litigation expenses. In addition, insurance companies incur policy acquisition expenses, such as commissions paid to producers and premium taxes, and other expenses related to the underwriting process, including their employees&#8217; compensation and benefits. 

&#160; 

The key measure of relative underwriting performance for an insurance company is the combined ratio. An insurance company&#8217;s combined ratio is calculated by adding the ratio of incurred loss and LAE to earned premiums (the &#8220;loss and LAE ratio&#8221;) and the ratio of policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses to earned premiums (the &#8220;expense ratio&#8221;). A combined ratio under 100% indicates that an insurance company is generating an underwriting profit. However, after considering investment income and investment gains or losses, insurance companies operating at a combined ratio of greater than 100% can be profitable. 

&#160; &#160; General; Strategy 

We are a property and casualty insurance holding company whose principal operating subsidiary is Kingstone Insurance Company, referred to as KICO, domiciled in the State of New York. We are a multi-line regional property and casualty insurance company writing business exclusively through independent retail and wholesale agents and brokers, referred to collectively as producers. We are licensed to write insurance policies in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Texas . 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We seek to deliver an attractive return on capital and to provide consistent earnings growth through underwriting profits and income from our investment portfolio. Our goal is to allocate capital efficiently to those lines of business that generate sustainable underwriting profits and exit any line for which an underwriting profit is not likely to result. Our strategy is to be the preferred multi-line property and casualty insurance company for selected producers in the geographic markets in which we operate. We believe producers prefer to place profitable business with us because we provide excellent, consistent service to our producers, policyholders and claimants coupled with competitive rates and commission levels and a consistent market presence. We offer a wide array of personal and commercial lines policies, and we believe that this differentiates us from other insurance companies that also distribute through our selected producers. 

Our principal objectives are to increase the volume of profitable business that we write while limiting our risk of loss and preserving our capital. We seek to generate underwriting income by writing profitable insurance policies and by effectively managing our other underwriting and operating expenses. We are pursuing profitable growth by expanding the geographic regions in which we operate, increasing the volume of business that we write with existing producers, developing new selected producer relationships, and introducing niche insurance products that are attractive to our producers and policyholders. 

&#160; &#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, our gross written premiums totaled $91.0 million, an increase of 19.3% from the $76.3 million in gross written premium for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our gross written premiums from our continuing lines of business grew by 23.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. 

&#160;

Product Lines 

&#160;

Our product lines include the following: 

&#160;

Personal lines - Our largest line of business is personal lines, consisting of homeowners, dwelling fire, 3-4 family dwelling package, condominiums, renters, equipment breakdown and service line endorsements, and personal umbrella policies. Personal lines policies accounted for 76.0% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Commercial liability - We offer business owners policies, which consist primarily of small business retail, service, and office risks without a residential exposure. We also write artisan&#8217;s liability policies for small independent contractors with seven or fewer employees. In addition, we write special multi-peril policies for larger and more specialized business owners&#8217; risks, including those with limited residential exposures. Commercial lines policies accounted for 13.2% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Commercial automobile &#8211; Until recently we provided liability and physical damage coverage for light vehicles owned by small contractors and artisans. However, due to the poor performance of this line, effective October 1, 2014, we decided to no longer accept new commercial auto policies. In February 2015, we decided to no longer offer renewals to our existing commercial auto policies beginning with those that expired on or after May 1, 2015. Commercial automobile policies accounted for 0.6% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Livery physical damage - We write for-hire vehicle physical damage only policies for livery and car service vehicles and taxicabs. These policies insure only the physical damage portion of insurance for such vehicles, with no liability coverage included. These policies accounted for 9.9% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Other - We write canine legal liability policies and also have a small participation in mandatory state joint underwriting associations. This subset of our business accounted for 0.3% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

&#160;

Our Competitive Strengths 

&#160;

History of Growing Our Profitable Operations 

Our insurance company subsidiary, KICO, has been in operation in the State of New York for 129 years. We have consistently increased the volume of profitable business that we write by introducing new insurance products, increasing the volume of business that we write with our selected producers and developing new producer relationships. KICO has earned an underwriting profit in each of the past ten years, including in 2012 when our financial results were adversely impacted by Superstorm Sandy. The extensive heritage of our insurance company subsidiary and our commitment to the New York market is a competitive advantage with producers and policyholders. 

&#160; 

Strong Producer Relationships 

Within our selected producers&#8217; offices, we compete with other property and casualty insurance carriers available to those producers. We carefully select the producers that distribute our insurance policies and continuously monitor and evaluate their performance. We believe our insurance producers value their relationships with us because we provide excellent, consistent personal service coupled with competitive rates and commission levels. We have consistently been rated by insurance producers as above average in the important areas of underwriting, claims handling and service. In the last three performance surveys conducted by the Professional Insurance Agents of New York and New Jersey (&#8220;PIA&#8221;) of its membership (2010, 2012, and 2014), KICO was rated as the one of the top performing insurance companies in New York, twice ranking as the top rated carrier among all those surveyed. 

We offer our selected producers the ability to write a wide array of personal lines and commercial lines policies, including some which are unique to us. Many of our producers write multiple lines of business with us, which provides an advantage over those competitors who are focused on a single product line. We now provide a multi-policy discount on homeowners policies in order to attract and retain more of this multi-line business. We have had a consistent presence in the New York market for over 100 years and we believe that producers value the longevity of our relationship with them. We believe that the excellent service we provide to our selected producers, our broad product offering, and our consistent market presence provides a foundation for profitable growth. 

&#160; &#160; 

Sophisticated Underwriting and Risk Management Practices 

We believe that we have a significant underwriting advantage due to our local market presence and expertise. Our underwriting process evaluates and screens out certain risks based on property reports, individual insurance scoring, information collected from physical property inspections, and driving records. We maintain certain policy exclusions that reduce our exposure to risks that can create severe losses. We target a more preferred risk profile in order to reduce adverse selection from risks seeking the lowest premiums by selecting only minimal coverage levels. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our underwriting procedures, premium rates and policy terms support the underwriting profitability of our personal lines policies. We apply premium surcharges for certain coastal properties and maintain deductibles for hurricane-prone exposures in order to provide an appropriate premium rate for the risk of loss. We limit the business that we write in certain coastal counties and within close proximity to coastlines, through the use of individual catastrophe risk scoring, in order to manage our exposure to catastrophic weather events. 

Our underwriting expertise and risk management practices enable us to profitably write personal and commercial lines business in our markets without the need for frequent rate adjustments. We believe that the consistency and the reliable availability of our insurance products is important to our selected producer relationships. 

Effective Utilization of Reinsurance 

Our reinsurance treaties allow us to limit our exposure to the financial impact of catastrophe losses and to reduce our net liability on individual risks. Our reinsurance program is structured to enable us to grow our premium volume while maintaining regulatory capital and other financial ratios generally within or below the expected ranges used for regulatory oversight purposes. 

Our reinsurance program also provides income as a result of ceding commissions earned pursuant to the quota share reinsurance contracts. The income we earn from ceding commissions typically exceeds our fixed operating costs, which consist of other underwriting expenses. Quota share reinsurance treaties transfer a portion of the profit (or loss) associated with the subject insurance policies to the reinsurers. We believe that a prudent reduction in our reliance on quota share reinsurance in the future could increase our overall net underwriting profits. 

Experienced Management Team 

Our management team has significant expertise in underwriting, agency management, claims management and insurance regulatory matters. Barry Goldstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has extensive experience in the insurance industry and managing public companies. He has served in his current capacity since 2001 and previously served as president of an insurance agency in Pennsylvania. John Reiersen, Executive Vice President of KICO, has over 50 years of industry and regulatory experience and previously served as Chief Examiner in the Property and Casualty Insurance Bureau of the New York State Insurance Department, now known as the New York State Department of Financial Services. Benjamin Walden, Senior Vice President and Chief Actuary of KICO, has 26 years of experience with both large and small insurance carriers and has also worked for actuarial consulting firms. Throughout his career, he has specialized in many of the markets that are a primary focus for KICO. Our underwriting and claims managers have extensive experience in the insurance industry with an average of 33 years of experience, including over 6 years with KICO on average. 

Scalable, Low-Cost Operations 

We focus on keeping expenses low, but invest in tools and processes that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of underwriting risks and processing claims. We evaluate the costs and benefits of each new tool or process in order to achieve optimal results. While the majority of our policies are written for risks in downstate New York, our Kingston, New York location provides a significantly lower cost operating environment. We also take a proactive approach to settling outstanding claims rather than engaging in protracted litigation, which results in substantially lower loss adjustment expenses and reduced reserve uncertainty. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We have made investments to develop online application and quoting systems for many of our personal lines and commercial products. This has resulted in increased business submissions from our producers due to the greater ease of placing business with us. We plan to expand these online capabilities to all lines of business. We have also leveraged a paperless workflow management and document storage tool in order to further improve efficiency and reduce costs. Our ability to control the growth of our operating and other expenses while growing revenue at a higher rate is a key component of our business model and is important to our future financial success. 

&#160;

Underwriting and Claims Management Philosophy 

&#160;

Our underwriting philosophy is to target niche risk segments for which we have detailed expertise and can take advantage of market conditions. We monitor results on a regular basis and all of our selected producers are reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. We utilize certain targeted policy exclusions to reduce our exposure to risks that can create severe losses. 

&#160; 

We believe that our rates are competitive with other carriers&#8217; rates in our markets. We believe that consistency and the reliable availability of our insurance products is important to our producers. We do not seek to grow by competing based solely upon price. We seek to develop long-term relationships with our selected producers who understand and appreciate the consistent path we have chosen. We carefully underwrite all of our business utilizing the CLUE industry claims database, insurance scoring reports, physical inspection of risks and other individual risk underwriting tools. In the event that a material misrepresentation is discovered in the underwriting application, the policy is voided. If a material misrepresentation is discovered after a claim is presented, we deny the claim. We write homeowners and dwelling fire business in New York City and Long Island and are cognizant of our exposure to hurricanes. We have mitigated this risk through application of mandatory hurricane deductibles in these areas. Our claim and underwriting expertise enables us to profitably write personal lines business in all areas of New York City and Long Island. 

&#160; 

Distribution 

&#160;

We generate business through our relationships with over 350 independent producers. We carefully select our producers by evaluating several factors such as their need for our products, premium production potential, loss history with other insurance companies that they represent, product and market knowledge, and the size of the agency. We only distribute through independent agents and have never sought to distribute our products direct to the consumer. We will not appoint any agency owned or controlled by another carrier which distributes its products direct to the consumer. We monitor and evaluate the performance of our producers through periodic reviews of volume, profitability, and quality of business. Our senior executives are actively involved in managing our producer relationships. 

&#160; 

Each producer is assigned an underwriter and the producer can call that underwriter directly on any matter. We believe that the close relationship with their underwriter is the principal reason producers place their business with us. Our online application and quoting systems have streamlined the process of placing business with KICO. Our producers have access to a website portal that contains all of our applications, quoting screens, policy forms and underwriting guidelines for all lines of business. We send out frequent electronic &#8220;Producer Grams&#8221; in order to inform our producers of updates at KICO. In addition, we have an active Producer Council and have at least one annual meeting with all of our producers. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Competition; Market 

&#160;

The insurance industry is highly competitive. We constantly assess and project the market conditions and prices for our products, but we cannot fully know our profitability until all claims have been reported and settled. 

&#160;

Our policyholders are located primarily in New York State. Our market primarily consists of New York City, Long Island and Westchester County, which we collectively define as Downstate New York. We are also licensed to write insurance in Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Texas, and are in the process of obtaining a license in one other state. 

New York State is the fourth largest property and casualty insurance market in the U.S. and the fourth largest state in the United States with respect to homeowners and dwelling fire insurance direct premiums written. In 2015, we were the 19th largest writer of homeowners and dwelling fire insurance in the State of New York, according to data compiled by SNL Financial. Based on this same data, we now have a 0.9% market share for this combined group of personal lines property business. We compete with large national carriers as well as regional and local carriers in the property and casualty marketplace in New York. We believe that many national and regional carriers have chosen to limit their rate of premium growth or to decrease their presence in the Downstate New York property insurance market due to the high catastrophe risk that exists in the region. Given present market conditions, we believe that we have the opportunity to significantly expand the size of our business in the State of New York, as well as in the other states where we recently became licensed. 

&#160; 

Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves 

&#160;

We are required to establish reserves for incurred losses that are unpaid, including reserves for claims and loss adjustment expenses (&#8220;LAE&#8221;), which represent the expenses of settling and adjusting those claims. These reserves are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss expenses for claims that have occurred at or before the balance sheet date, whether already known to us or not yet reported. We establish these reserves after considering all information known to us as of the date they are recorded. 

&#160;

Loss reserves fall into two categories: case reserves for reported losses and loss expenses associated with a specific reported insured claim, and reserves for losses incurred but not reported (&#8220;IBNR&#8221;) and LAE. We establish these two categories of loss reserves as follows: 

&#160;

Reserves for reported losses - When a claim is received, we establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of its ultimate settlement and its estimated loss expenses. We establish case reserves based upon the known facts about each claim at the time the claim is reported and may subsequently increase or reduce the case reserves as our claims department deems necessary based upon the development of additional facts about claims. 

&#160;

IBNR reserves - We also estimate and establish reserves for loss and LAE amounts incurred but not yet reported. IBNR reserves are calculated as ultimate losses and LAE less reported losses and LAE. Ultimate losses are projected by using generally accepted actuarial techniques. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The liability for loss and LAE represents our best estimate of the ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses that are unpaid as of the balance sheet date. The liability for loss and LAE is estimated on an undiscounted basis, using individual case-basis valuations, statistical analyses and various actuarial procedures. The projection of future claim payment and reporting is based on an analysis of our historical experience, supplemented by analyses of industry loss data. We believe that the reserves for loss and LAE are adequate to cover the ultimate cost of losses and claims to date; however, because of the uncertainty from various sources, including changes in reporting patterns, claims settlement patterns, judicial decisions, legislation, and economic conditions, actual loss experience may not conform to the assumptions used in determining the estimated amounts for such liability at the balance sheet date. As adjustments to these estimates become necessary, such adjustments are reflected in expense for the period in which the estimates are changed. Because of the nature of the business historically written, we believe that we have limited exposure to asbestos and environmental claim liabilities. We recognize recoveries from salvage and subrogation when received. 

&#160;

We engage an independent external actuarial specialist to opine on our recorded statutory reserves. Our actuary estimates a range of ultimate losses, along with a range and recommended central estimate of IBNR reserve amounts. 

&#160;

Reconciliation of Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses

Our claims reserving practices are designed to set reserves that, in the aggregate, are adequate to pay all claims at their ultimate settlement value. 

&#160;

Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Development 

&#160;

The table below shows the net loss development for business written each year from 2005 through 2015. The table reflects the changes in our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves in subsequent years from the prior loss estimates based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The next section of the table sets forth the re-estimates in later years of incurred losses, including payments for the years indicated. The next section of the table shows by year, the cumulative amounts of loss and loss adjustment expense payments, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, as of the end of each succeeding year. For example, with respect to the net loss reserves of $4,370,000 as of December 31, 2006, by December 31, 2008 (two years later), $3,303,000 had actually been paid in settlement of the claims that relate to liabilities as of December 31, 2006. 

&#160;

The &#8220;cumulative redundancy (deficiency)&#8221; represents, as of December 31, 2015, the difference between the latest re-estimated liability and the amounts as originally estimated. A redundancy means that the original estimate was higher than the current estimate. A deficiency means that the current estimate is higher than the original estimate.

&#160;

Reinsurance 

&#160;

We purchase reinsurance to reduce our net liability on individual risks, to protect against possible catastrophes, to achieve a target ratio of net premiums written to policyholders&#8217; surplus and to expand our underwriting capacity. Our reinsurance program is structured to reflect our obligations and goals. Reinsurance via quota share allows for a carrier to write business without increasing its underwriting leverage above a management determined ratio. The business written under a reinsurance quota share obligates a reinsurer to assume the risks involved, and gives the reinsurer the profit (or loss) associated with such. We have determined it to be in the best interests of our shareholders to prudently reduce our reliance on quota share reinsurance. This will result in higher earned premiums and a reduction in ceding commission revenue in future years. Our participation in reinsurance arrangements does not relieve us from our obligations to policyholders. 

&#160;

Our quota share reinsurance treaties in effect for the year ended December 31, 2015 for our personal lines business, which primarily consists of homeowners&#8217; policies, were covered under the July 1, 2014/June 30, 2015 treaty year (&#8220;2014/2015 Treaty&#8221;) and July 1, 2015/June 30, 2016 treaty year (&#8220;2015/2016 Treaty&#8221;). The expired 2014/2015 Treaty was at a 55% quota share percentage and the current 2015/2016 Treaty is at a 40% quota share percentage. Our maximum net retention under the quota share and excess of loss treaties for any one personal lines policy for dates of loss after July 1, 2015 is $450,000. 

&#160; 

We did not renew our expiring 25% commercial lines quota share reinsurance treaty on July 1, 2014. Excess of loss contracts provide coverage for individual commercial lines losses. Our maximum net retention under excess of loss treaties for any one commercial general liability policy for dates of loss after July 1, 2015 is $425,000. Commercial auto policies are covered by an excess of loss reinsurance contract that provides coverage for individual losses in excess of $300,000. 

&#160;

We earn ceding commission revenue under the quota share reinsurance treaties based on a provisional commission rate on all premiums ceded to the reinsurers as adjusted by a sliding scale based on the ultimate treaty year loss ratios on the policies reinsured under each agreement. The sliding scale provides minimum and maximum ceding commission rates in relation to specified ultimate loss ratios. Under the 2015/2016 Treaty, we are receiving a higher upfront fixed provisional rate in exchange for a less favorable sliding scale contingent rate. Under this arrangement, we earn more provisional ceding commissions, while contingent ceding commissions are reduced due the less favorable sliding scale rate. 

&#160;

The 2015/2016 Treaty is on a &#8220;net&#8221; of catastrophe reinsurance basis, as opposed to the &#8220;gross&#8221; arrangement that existed in prior treaties. Under a &#8220;net&#8221; arrangement, all catastrophe reinsurance coverage is now purchased directly by us. Since we pay for all of the catastrophe coverage, none of the losses covered under a catastrophic event will be included in the quota share, drastically reducing the adverse impact that a catastrophic event can have on ceding commissions. 

In 2015, we purchased catastrophe reinsurance to provide coverage of up to $180 million for losses associated with a single event. One of the most commonly used catastrophe forecasting models prepared for us indicates that the catastrophe reinsurance treaties provide coverage in excess of our estimated probable maximum loss associated with a single one-in-200 year storm event. Losses on personal lines policies are subject to the 40% quota share treaty, which results in a net retention by us of $2.4 million of exposure per catastrophe occurrence. Our catastrophe reinsurance also covers losses caused by severe winter weather during any consecutive 28 day period. Catastrophe coverage is limited on an annual basis to two times the per occurrence amounts. Effective July 1, 2015, we have reinstatement premium protection on the first $16,000,000 layer of catastrophe coverage in excess of $4,000,000.

Ratings 

&#160;

Many insurance buyers, agents and brokers use the ratings assigned by A.M. Best and other agencies to assist them in assessing the financial strength and overall quality of the companies from which they are considering purchasing insurance. In 2009, KICO applied for its initial A.M. Best rating, and was assigned a letter rating of &#8220;B&#8221; (Fair) by A.M. Best in 2010. Our rating was upgraded to B+ (Good) in 2011 and B++ (Good) in 2015. KICO is beginning the process of undergoing its annual review from A.M. Best, which may result in a change to its rating. A.M. Best ratings are derived from an in-depth evaluation of an insurance company&#8217;s balance sheet strengths, operating performances and business profiles. A.M. Best evaluates, among other factors, the company&#8217;s capitalization, underwriting leverage, financial leverage, asset leverage, capital structure, quality and appropriateness of reinsurance, adequacy of reserves, quality and diversification of assets, liquidity, profitability, spread of risk, revenue composition, market position, management, market risk and event risk. A.M. Best ratings are intended to provide an independent opinion of an insurer&#8217;s ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not an evaluation directed at investors. An A.M. Best rating of A- or better could create additional demand from producers in markets requiring a carrier to have that level of rating from A.M. Best. We currently have a Demotech rating of A (Excellent) which generally qualifies our policies as eligible by most banks and finance companies. 

&#160; 

Severe Winter Weather 

&#160;

Our predominant market, downstate New York, suffered severe weather during the winters of 2015 and 2014. We include severe winter weather in our definition of catastrophe. The catastrophe component of 2015 and 2014 severe winters was determined by the number of claims in excess of our threshold of average claims from severe winter weather. These claims were primarily from losses due to frozen pipes, weight of snow and ice, and other water related structural damage as a result of excess snow and below normal temperatures for an extended period of time. The effects of severe winter weather increased our net loss ratio by 4.3 percentage points in 2015 and 2.9 percentage points in 2014. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The computation to determine contingent ceding commission revenue includes direct catastrophe losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred from severe winter weather. Such losses increased our ceded loss ratio in our July 1, 2014/June 30, 2015 personal lines quota share treaties which reduced our contingent ceding commission revenue by $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The effects of severe winter weather increased our net underwriting expense ratio by 2.7 percentage points in 2015. The effects of severe winter weather increased our ceded loss ratio in our July 1, 2013/June 30, 2014 personal lines quota share treaties which reduced our contingent ceding commission revenue by $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The effects of severe winter weather increased our net underwriting expense ratio by 1.6 percentage points in 2014. 

&#160;

Premium Financing 

&#160;

Customers who purchase insurance policies are often unable to pay the premium in a lump sum or are unable to afford the payment plan offered and, therefore, require extended payment terms. Premium finance involves making a loan to the customer that is secured by the unearned portion of the insurance premiums being financed and held by the insurance carrier. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Payments Inc. (&#8220;Payments&#8221;), is licensed as a premium finance agency in the state of New York. 

&#160;

Prior to February 1, 2008, Payments Inc. provided premium financing in connection with the obtaining of insurance policies. Effective February 1, 2008, Payments Inc. sold its outstanding premium finance loan portfolio. The purchaser of the portfolio (the &#8220;Purchaser&#8221;) agreed that, during the five year period ended February 1, 2013 (which period was extended to February 1, 2015), it would purchase, assume and service all eligible premium finance contracts originated by Payments in the state of New York (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;). In connection with such purchases, Payments was entitled to receive a fee generally equal to a percentage of the amount financed. On July 17, 2014, the Purchaser terminated the Agreement effective February 1, 2015. Following any expiration or termination of the obligation of the Purchaser to purchase premium finance contracts, Payments was entitled to receive the fees for an additional two years (&#8220;Termination Period&#8221;) with regard to contracts for policies from our producers. On March 26, 2015, we and the Purchaser agreed to amend the Termination Period to end as of March 31, 2015 (&#8220;Termination Date&#8221;). We received a one-time payment of $350,000 in exchange for the fees that we would have received during the Termination Period. In connection with such agreement, we agreed to several restrictive covenants, including that, for a period of eighteen months following the Termination Date, we would not engage in the premium financing business within New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Our premium financing business consisted of the placement fees that Payments earned from placing contracts. Placement fees earned from placing contracts constituted approximately 0.1% and 0.5% of our revenues from operations during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Holding Company Regulation 

&#160;

We, as the parent of KICO, are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the state of New York. These laws generally require an insurance company to register with the New York State Department of Financial Services (the &#8220;DFS&#8221;) and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within our holding company system. Generally under these laws, all material transactions among companies in the holding company system to which KICO is a party must be fair and reasonable and, if material or of a specified category, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the DFS. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Change of Control 

&#160;

The insurance holding company laws of the state of New York require approval by the DFS for any change of control of an insurer. &#8220;Control&#8221; is generally defined as the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the company, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. Control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of 10% or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or any entity that controls a domestic insurance company. Any future transactions that would constitute a change of control of KICO, including a change of control of Kingstone Companies, Inc., would generally require the party acquiring control to obtain the approval of the DFS (and in any other state in which KICO may operate). Obtaining these approvals may result in the material delay of, or deter, any such transaction. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of Kingstone Companies, Inc., including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable. 

&#160; 

State Insurance Regulation 

&#160;

Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the department of insurance in the state in which they are domiciled and, to a lesser extent, other states in which they conduct business. The primary purpose of such regulatory powers is to protect individual policyholders. State insurance authorities have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers, including, among other things, the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business, set the standards of solvency to be met and maintained, determine the nature of, and limitations on, investments and dividends, approve policy forms and rates in some instances and regulate unfair trade and claims practices. 

&#160;

KICO is required to file detailed financial statements and other reports with the insurance departments in the states in which KICO is licensed to transact business. These financial statements are subject to periodic examination by the insurance departments. 

&#160;

In addition, many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer&#8217;s ability to withdraw from a particular market. For example, states may limit an insurer&#8217;s ability to cancel or not renew policies. Furthermore, certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business written in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. The state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations, including those in New York, that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict the ability of KICO to exit unprofitable markets. 

&#160;

In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, the DFS adopted various emergency regulations that affect insurance companies that operate in the state of New York. Included among the regulations is mandatory participation in non-binding mediation proceedings funded by the insurer. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Federal and State Legislative and Regulatory Changes 

&#160;

From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the insurance industry. Among the proposals that have in the past been or at the present being considered are the possible introduction of Federal regulation in addition to, or in lieu of, the current system of state regulation of insurers, and proposals in various state legislatures (some of which proposals have been enacted) to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model acts adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the &#8220;NAIC&#8221;). 

&#160;

In December 2010, the NAIC adopted amendments to the Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulation Act and Regulation (the &#8220;Amended Model Act and Regulation&#8221;) to introduce the concept of &#8220;enterprise risk&#8221; within an insurance company holding system. Enterprise risk is defined as any activity, circumstance, event or series of events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied promptly, is likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or the liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. If and when adopted by a particular state, the Amended Model Act and Regulation would impose more extensive informational requirements on us in order to protect the licensed insurance companies from enterprise risk, including requiring us to prepare an annual enterprise risk report that identifies the material risks within the insurance company holding system that could pose enterprise risk to the licensed insurer. In addition, the Amended Model Act and Regulation requires any controlling person of a domestic insurer seeking to divest its controlling interest to file a notice of its proposed divestiture, which may be subject to approval by the insurance commissioner. The Amended Model Act and Regulation must be adopted by the individual states, and specifically states in which we are licensed, for the new requirements to apply to us. The NAIC has made certain sections of the amendments part of its accreditation standards for state solvency regulation, which may motivate more states to adopt the amendments promptly. Additional requirements are also expected. For example, the NAIC has adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (&#8220;ORSA&#8221;) Model Act, which, when adopted by the states, will require insurers to perform a risk and solvency assessment and, upon request of a state, file an ORSA Summary Report with the state. The ORSA Summary Report will be required in 2015, subject to the various dates of adoption by states, and will describe our process for assessing our own solvency. 

&#160;

In 2013, New York, where KICO is domiciled, adopted its version of the Amended Model Act and Regulation. The statute requires a holding company that directly or indirectly controls an insurer to adopt a formal enterprise risk management function and file an enterprise risk report with the DFS by April 30 of each year commencing in 2014. In 2014, the DFS promulgated the implementing regulations. The report must identify the material risks within the holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the insurer. In addition, any holding company seeking to divest its controlling interest in a domestic insurer is required to file with the DFS a notice of its proposed divestiture at least thirty days prior to cessation of control. Also in 2014 the DFS also promulgated two amendments to its holding company regulation affecting the transactions between the insurer and any person in the holding company system and requiring additional information in applications for control. In 2015, the DFS indicated that it will initiate new targeted cybersecurity assessments for insurance companies. 

&#160;

On November 9, 2015, the DFS sent a letter to financial regulators outlining the parameters of the regulations. While the letter primarily addresses banking institutions, it is expected the regulations will also apply to insurance companies. 

&#160;

On July 21, 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) that established a Federal Insurance Office (the &#8220;FIO&#8221;) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The FIO is initially charged with monitoring all aspects of the insurance industry (other than health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance), gathering data, and conducting a study on methods to modernize and improve the insurance regulatory system in the United States. On December 12, 2013, the FIO issued a report (as required under the Dodd-Frank Act) entitled &#8220;How to Modernize and Improve the System of Insurance Regulation in the United States&#8221; (the &#8220;Report&#8221;), which stated that, given the &#8220;uneven&#8221; progress the states have made with several near-term state reforms, should the states fail to accomplish the necessary modernization reforms in the near term, &#8220;Congress should strongly consider direct federal involvement.&#8221; The FIO continues to support the current state-based regulatory regime, but will consider federal regulation should the states fail to take steps to greater uniformity (e.g., federal licensing of insurers). 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

State Insurance Department Examinations 

&#160;

As part of their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed examinations of the financial reporting of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC. 

&#160;

Risk-Based Capital Regulations 

&#160;

State insurance departments impose risk-based capital (&#8220;RBC&#8221;) requirements on insurance enterprises. The RBC Model serves as a benchmark for the regulation of insurance companies by state insurance regulators. RBC provides for targeted surplus levels based on formulas, which specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk, and are set forth in the RBC requirements. Such formulas focus on four general types of risk: (a) the risk with respect to the company&#8217;s assets (asset or default risk); (b) the risk of default on amounts due from reinsurers, policyholders, or other creditors (credit risk); (c) the risk of underestimating liabilities from business already written or inadequately pricing business to be written in the coming year (underwriting risk); and (d) the risk associated with items such as excessive premium growth, contingent liabilities, and other items not reflected on the balance sheet (off-balance sheet risk). The amount determined under such formulas is called the authorized control level RBC (&#8220;ACLC&#8221;). 

The RBC guidelines define specific capital levels based on a company&#8217;s ACLC that are determined by the ratio of the company&#8217;s total adjusted capital (&#8220;TAC&#8221;) to its ACLC. TAC is equal to statutory capital, plus or minus certain other specified adjustments. KICO was in compliance with New York&#8217;s RBC requirements as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160;

Dividend Limitations 

&#160;

Our ability to receive dividends from KICO is restricted by the state laws and insurance regulations of New York. These restrictions are related to surplus and net investment income. Dividends are restricted to the lesser of 10% of surplus or 100% of investment income (on a statutory accounting basis) for the trailing 36 months, less dividends paid during such period. 

&#160;

Insurance Regulatory Information System Ratios 

&#160;

The Insurance Regulatory Information System, or IRIS, was developed by the NAIC and is intended primarily to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies &#8220;usual values&#8221; for each ratio. Departure from the usual values on four or more of the ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance commissioners as to certain aspects of an insurer&#8217;s business. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, as a result of its growth and reduction of its quota share reinsurance percentages, KICO had two ratios outside the usual range due to an increase in net premiums written and an estimated current reserve deficiency to surplus. 

&#160;

Accounting Principles 

&#160;

Statutory accounting principles (&#8220;SAP&#8221;) are a basis of accounting developed by the NAIC. They are used to prepare the statutory financial statements of insurance companies and to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies. SAP is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer&#8217;s surplus to policyholders. Accordingly, statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer&#8217;s domiciliary state. 

&#160; 

Generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) is concerned with a company&#8217;s solvency, but is also concerned with other financial measurements, principally income and cash flows. Accordingly, GAAP gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management&#8217;s stewardship of assets than does SAP. As a direct result, different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP as compared to SAP. 

&#160;

Statutory accounting practices established by the NAIC and adopted in part by the New York insurance regulators, determine, among other things, the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of KICO and thus determine, in part, the amount of funds that are available to pay dividends to Kingstone Companies, Inc.
