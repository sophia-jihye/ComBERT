 Item 1 . Business &#160; 

General 

&#160; 

The Bank of South Carolina (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;) was organized on October 22, 1986 and opened for business as a state-chartered financial institution on February 26, 1987, in Charleston, South Carolina. The Bank was reorganized into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of South Carolina Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), effective April 17, 1995. At the time of the reorganization, each outstanding share of the Bank was exchanged for two shares of Bank of South Carolina Corporation Stock. 

&#160; 

Market Area 

&#160; 

The Bank operates as an independent, community oriented, commercial bank providing a broad range of financial services and products. We have four banking house locations: 256 Meeting Street, Charleston, SC, 100 North Main Street, Summerville, SC, 1337 Chuck Dawley Boulevard, Mt. Pleasant, SC and 2027 Sam Rittenberg Boulevard, Charleston, SC. We intend to open a banking office in North Charleston, SC on Highway 78 and Ingleside Boulevard in the future (copy of the lease incorporated as Exhibit 10.8 in the 2013 10-K and copy of the Assignment and Assumption of Lease incorporated as Exhibit 10.9, First Amendment to the Lease incorporated as Exhibit 10.10 and Second Amendment to the Lease incorporated as Exhibit 10.11 of this 10-K) . 

&#160; 

The primary economic drivers of our market area are tourism, manufacturing and medical services. In addition, we have one of the busiest container ports in the United States as well as a Boeing plant in North Charleston, SC. In October 2009, Boeing selected a site in North Charleston SC, for a 787 Dreamliner final assembly and delivery line. Boeing South Carolina has added the IT Centers of Excellence, Engineering Design Center, Boeing Research &#38; Technology Center and Propulsion South Carolina to its North Charleston campus and will be adding a painting facility in 2016. Future development in our market area includes both a Volvo and Mercedes plant.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The financial services industry is highly competitive. We face competition in attracting deposits and originating loans based upon a variety of factors including: 

&#160; 

&#9679; interest rates offered on deposit accounts 

&#9679; interest rates charged on loans 

&#9679; credit and service charges 

&#9679; the quality of services rendered 

&#9679; the convenience of banking facilities and other delivery channels and 

&#9679; in the case of loans, relative lending limits. &#160; 

We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, finance companies, credit unions and other financial services companies. Many of our larger commercial bank competitors have greater name recognition and offer certain services that we do not. However, we believe that we have developed an effective competitive advantage in our market area that includes Charleston, Berkeley and Dorchester counties of South Carolina by emphasizing our exceptional service levels, and knowledge of local trends and conditions. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Lending Activities 

&#160; 

We focus our lending activities on small and middle market businesses, professionals and individuals in our geographic markets and typically require a personal guarantee. Our primary lending activities are commercial real estate, one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans, commercial business loans and home equity loans and lines of credit. Our largest category of loans is commercial real estate. Most loans are to borrowers located in our market area of Charleston, Dorchester and Berkeley Counties of South Carolina. 

&#160; 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, $115.7 million, or 46.58%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans. Properties securing our commercial real estate loans primarily comprise business owner-occupied properties, small office buildings and office suites, and income-producing real estate. 

&#160; 

In the underwriting of commercial real estate loans, we generally lend up to the lesser of 80% of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property. We base our decision to lend primarily on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan, we emphasize the ratio of the property&#8217;s projected net cash flow to the loan&#8217;s debt service requirement computed after deduction for an appropriate vacancy factor and reasonable expenses. We typically require title insurance, earthquake insurance, casualty insurance, and, if appropriate, flood insurance, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property. 

&#160; 

Commercial real estate loans generally carry higher credit risks, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions not within the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the underlying collateral or the future cash flow of the property. 

&#160; 

Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, $36.5 million, or 14.68% of our loan portfolio consisted of home equity loans and lines of credit. In addition to traditional one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans, we offer home equity loans and lines of credit that are secured by the borrower&#8217;s primary or secondary residence. Our home equity loans and lines of credit are currently originated with adjustable rates of interest, with a floor. Home equity loans and lines of credit are generally underwritten with the same criteria that we use to underwrite one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans. For a borrower&#8217;s primary residence, home equity loans and lines of credit are typically underwritten with a loan-to-value ratio of 80% when combined with the principal balance of the existing mortgage loan, while the maximum loan-to-value ratio on secondary residences is 70% when combined with the principal balance of the existing mortgage loan. We require a current appraisal or internally prepared real estate evaluations on home equity loans and lines of credit. At the time we close a home equity loan or line of credit, we record a mortgage to perfect our security interest in the underlying collateral. 

&#160; 

Commercial Loans 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, $50.9 million, or 20.50%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans. We originate various types of secured and unsecured commercial loans to customers in our market areas in order to provide customers with working capital and for other general business purposes. The terms of these loans generally range from less than one year to a maximum of 10 years. These loans bear either a fixed interest rate or an interest rate linked to a variable market index. We seek to originate loans to small-to-medium-sized businesses. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Commercial credit decisions are based upon our credit assessment of each applicant. We evaluate the applicant&#8217;s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms of the loan and we assess the risks involved. In addition to evaluating the applicant&#8217;s financial statements, we consider the adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment for the loan. Credit agency reports of the applicant&#8217;s personal credit history supplement our analysis of the applicant&#8217;s creditworthiness. In addition, collateral supporting a secured transaction is analyzed to determine its marketability. Commercial business loans generally have higher interest rates than residential loans of similar duration because they have a higher risk of default with repayment generally depending on the successful operation of the borrower&#8217;s business and the sufficiency of any collateral. 

&#160; 

One-to-Four-Family Residential Construction, Other Construction and Land, and Consumer Loans 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, our portfolio included $5.8 million of one-to-four-family residential construction loans or 2.35% of our loan portfolio. Other construction and land loans comprised $1.0 million, or .40% of our loan portfolio. Consumer loans totaled $38.5 million, or 15.48% of our loan portfolio, and included automobile and other consumer loans. We make construction loans to owner-occupiers of residential properties, and to business for commercial properties. Advances on construction loans are made in accordance with a schedule reflecting the cost of construction, but are generally limited to 80% loan-to-value ratio based on the appraised value upon completion. Repayment of construction loans on non-residential properties is normally attributable to rental income, income from the borrower&#8217;s operating entity or the sale of the property. Repayment of loans on income-producing property is normally scheduled following completion of construction, when permanent financing is obtained. Construction loans are interest-only during the construction period, which typically does not exceed 12 months and are often paid-off with permanent financing. 

&#160; 

Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by a state-certified or state-licensed appraiser. We review and inspect properties before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. 

&#160; 

Construction financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. Construction loans also expose us to risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. 

&#160; 

Loan Originations 

&#160; 

All residential loans that we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures. We originate both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans. Our loan origination and sales activity may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment that typically results in decreased loan demand. 

&#160; 

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority 

&#160; 

Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the Board of Directors of the Bank. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan and value of the collateral that will secure the loan. To assess the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay, we review the borrower&#8217;s employment and credit history and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower. 

&#160; 

The objectives of our lending program are to: 

&#160; 

1. Establish a sound asset structure. 

2. Provide a sound and profitable loan portfolio to: 

a) Protect the depositor&#8217;s funds 

b) Maximize the shareholders&#8217; return on their investment 

3. Promote the stable economic growth and development of the market area served by the Bank. 

4. Comply with all Regulatory Agency requirements and applicable law. &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The individual secured/unsecured lending authority of the President/Chief Executive Officer of the Bank is set at $1,000,000 and the individual secured/unsecured lending authority of the Senior Lender/Executive Vice President is set at $500,000. The President/Chief Executive Officer of the Bank and the Senior Lender/Executive Vice President may jointly lend up to 10% of the Bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital for the previous quarter end. In the absence of either of the above, the other may, jointly with the approval of either the Chairman of the Board of Directors or a majority of the Loan Committee of the Board of Directors, lend up to 10% of the Bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital for the previous quarter end. The Board of Directors, with two-thirds vote, may approve the aggregate credit in excess of this limit but may not exceed 15% of the Bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital. 

&#160; 

The Senior Lender/Executive Vice President may establish the unsecured loan authority of the individual loan officers of the Bank not to exceed $100,000 and secured loan authority not to exceed $250,000. With the concurrence of the President/Chief Executive Officer, the Senior Lender/Executive Vice President may approve unsecured lending authority of individual lending officers up to $250,000. Loan limits apply to the total direct and indirect liability of the borrower. All loans above the loan officer&#8217;s authority must have the approval of a loan officer with the authority to approve a loan of that amount. Pooling of loan authority is not allowed except as outlined above for the President/Chief Executive Officer, Senior Lender/Executive Vice President and a majority of the Loan Committee or two-thirds of the Board of Directors. 

&#160; 

Every new and renewed loan is graded according to a loan rating matrix and assigned a risk rating of excellent, good, satisfactory, watch, OAEM, substandard, doubtful, or loss based on cash flow, collateral, guarantor, financial condition, management, operating performance, financial statements, loan performance, leverage, and debt serve coverage. A weighted average method is used to compute the rating with cash flow, financial condition, and debt service being weighted three times, and financial statements being weighted two times the amount of the other factors. When a loan rating is between (and including) 3.5 and 4.4, it is placed on the watch list. When the rating is 4.5 or higher, it is placed on the classified loan list in the appropriate risk grade. The ratings are included on the loan summary, when applicable, and are reviewed by the President/Chief Executive Officer and Senior Loan Officer/Executive Vice President. 

&#160; 

Except for mortgage loans in the process of being sold to investors and loans secured by properly margined negotiable securities traded on an established market or other cash collateral, all new credit which results in aggregate direct, indirect, and related credit, not under an approved line of credit of $200,000 or more, will be reviewed in detail on a monthly basis by the Loan Committee and those new credits, exclusive of mortgage loans in the process of being sold to investors, which result in aggregate direct, indirect and related credit, not under an approved line of credit, of $500,000 or more will be reported to the Board of Directors at its regular monthly meeting. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we employed 81 people, with two individuals considered part time, none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We provide a variety of benefit programs including an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust, Stock Incentive Plan, health, life, disability and other insurance. We believe our relationship with our employees is excellent. 

&#160; 

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to extensive state and federal banking laws and regulations that impose specific requirements or restrictions and provide for general regulatory oversight of virtually all aspects of operations. The regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, customers, and the integrity of the U.S. banking system and capital markets. The following information describes some of the more significant laws and regulations applicable to us. The description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised in Congress, in state legislatures, and with the various bank regulatory agencies. Changes in applicable laws or regulations, or a change in the way such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material impact on our business operations and earnings. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Dodd-Frank Act 

&#160; 

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) became effective. This law has broadly affected the financial services industry by implementing changes to the financial regulatory landscape aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services industry, and will continue to significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies, including the Company and the Bank. Under the Dodd-Frank Act a broad range of new rules and regulations by various federal agencies have been implemented, and further rulemaking must be proposed and adopted which will take effect over several years. Although we have already experienced some decrease in revenue because of the rules implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act, the overall financial impact the Act will have on the Company, our customers, or the financial industry in general remains difficult to anticipate. 

&#160; 

Bank Holding Company Act 

&#160; 

The Company is a one-bank holding company under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;Bank Holding Company Act&#8221;). As a result, the Company is primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) under the Bank Holding Company Act and its regulations promulgated thereunder. Moreover, as a bank holding company located in South Carolina, the Company is also subject to the regulations of the South Carolina State Board of Financial Institutions. 

&#160; 

Capital Requirements 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve Board imposes certain capital requirements on the Company under the Bank Holding Company Act, including a minimum leverage ratio and minimum ratio of &#8220;qualifying&#8221; capital to risk-weighted assets. These requirements are essentially the same as those that apply to the Bank and are described under &#8220;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#8221; in the notes to the financial statements. The ability of the Company to pay dividends depends on the Bank&#8217;s ability to pay dividends to the Company, which is subject to regulatory restrictions as described below in &#8220;Dividends&#8221;. 

&#160; 

Standards for Safety and Soundness 

&#160; 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to (1) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, (2) loan documentation, (3) credit underwriting, (4) interest rate risk exposure, and (5) asset growth. The agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation, as well as standards for compensation, fees, and benefits. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and &#8220;Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness&#8221; to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Examination 

&#160; 

All insured institutions must undergo regular on-site examinations by their appropriate banking agency. The cost of examinations of insured depository institutions and any affiliates may be assessed by the appropriate banking agency against each institution or affiliate, as it deems necessary or appropriate. Insured institutions are required to submit annual reports to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), their federal regulatory agency, and state supervisor when applicable. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The federal banking regulatory agencies prescribe, by regulation, standards for all insured depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating, among other things, to the following: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Internal controls 

&#9679; Information systems and audit systems 

&#9679; Loan documentation 

&#9679; Credit underwriting 

&#9679; Interest rate risk exposure 

&#9679; Asset quality 

&#9679; Liquidity 

&#9679; Capital adequacy 

&#9679; Bank Secrecy Act 

&#9679; Sensitivity to market risk &#160; 

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 

&#160; 

We are subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, certain principal shareholders, and their related interests. Such extensions of credit (1) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates, and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and (2) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. 

&#160; 

Dividends 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to its shareholders, is dividends it receives from the Bank. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to the Bank&#8217;s payment of dividends to the Company. As a general rule, the amount of a dividend may not exceed, without prior regulatory approval, the sum of net income in the calendar year to date and the retained net earnings of the immediately preceding two calendar years. A depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause the institution to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. 

&#160; 

Consumer Protection Regulations 

&#160; 

Activities of the Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. Interest and other charges collected by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Our loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions such as: 

&#160; 

&#9679; The federal Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers 

&#9679; The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves 

&#9679; Fair Lending Act, fair equitable, and nondiscriminatory access to credit for consumers 

&#9679; The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit 

&#9679; The Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies 

&#9679; The Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debt may be collected by collection agencies 

&#9679; The rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The deposit operations of the Bank also are subject to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records 

&#9679; The Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Federal Reserve Board to implement that Act, which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit and customer&#8217;s rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services 

&#9679; Regulation DD which implements the Truth in Savings Act to enable consumers to make informed decisions about deposit accounts at depository institutions. Regulation DD requires depository institutions to provide disclosures so that consumers can make meaningful comparisons among depository institutions. &#160; 

Enforcement Powers 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve and the South Carolina State Board of Financial Institutions. The Bank is subject to extensive federal and state regulations that significantly affect business and activities. These regulatory bodies have broad authority to implement standards and to initiate proceedings designed to prohibit depository institutions from engaging in activities that represent unsafe or unsound banking practices or constitute violations of applicable laws, rules, regulations, administrative orders, or written agreements with regulators. These regulatory bodies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards, including the assessment of civil monetary penalties, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, and other actions. 

&#160; 

Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering 

&#160; 

We are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act of 2001. We must maintain a Bank Secrecy Act Program that includes (1) established internal policies, procedures, and controls, (2) a designated compliance officer, (3) an ongoing employee training program and, (4) testing of the program by an independent audit function. The USA Patriot Act amended in part the Bank Secrecy Act provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and the Company for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering by enhancing anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws, as well as enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the US government. These provisions include (1) requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening, (2) rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering, and (3) filing suspicious activity reports if the Company believes a customer may be violating US laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Privacy and Credit Reporting 

&#160; 

In connection with its lending activities, we are subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Community Reinvestment Act (the &#8220;CRA&#8221;). In addition, federal banking regulators, pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, have enacted regulations limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third parties. The regulations require disclosure of privacy policies and allow consumers to prevent certain personal information from being shared with nonaffiliated third parties. The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the bank&#8217;s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of &#8220;outstanding,&#8221; &#8220;satisfactory,&#8221; &#8220;needs to improve,&#8221; or &#8220;substantial non-compliance.&#8221; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;) as an agency to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection, including implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB has begun exercising supervisory review of banks under its jurisdiction. The CFPB is expected to focus its rulemaking in several areas, particularly in the areas of mortgage reform involving the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act; however, the content of the final rules and impact to our businesses are uncertain at this time. Additional rulemakings to come under the Dodd-Frank Act will dictate compliance changes for financial institutions. Any such changes in regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Bank make it difficult to predict the ultimate effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

&#160; 

Check 21 

&#160; 

The Check Clearing for the 21 st Century Act gives &#8220;substitute checks,&#8221; such as a digital image of a check and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check. The following are some of the major provisions: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Allowing check truncation without making it mandatory 

&#9679; Demanding that every financial institution communicate to account holders in writing a description of its substitute check processing program and their rights under the law 

&#9679; Legalizing substitutions for and replacement of paper checks without agreement from consumers 

&#9679; Retaining in place the previously mandated electronic collection and return of checks between financial institutions only when individual agreements are in place 

&#9679; Requiring that when account holders request verification, financial institutions produce the original check (or a copy that accurately represents the original) and demonstrate that the account debit was accurate and valid 

&#9679; Requiring the re-crediting of funds to an individual&#8217;s account on the next business day after a consumer proves that the financial institution has erred. &#160;
