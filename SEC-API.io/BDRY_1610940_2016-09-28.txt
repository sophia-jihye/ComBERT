 Item 1. Business. &#160; 

The Trust and the Fund 

&#160;

The Sit Rising Rate ETF (the &#8220;Fund&#8221;), a series of the ETF Managers Group Commodity Trust I (the &#8220;Trust&#8221;), is an exchange traded fund that issues shares that trade on the NYSE Arca stock exchange (&#8220;NYSE Arca&#8221;). The Fund commenced investment operations on February 19, 2015. The Trust was established on July 23, 2014 and is organized as a series trust pursuant to the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. The Fund is currently the sole series of the Trust. Additional series may be designated in the future.

&#160;

The principal office of the Trust and Fund is located at 30 Maple Street - Suite 2, Summit, NJ 07901. The telephone number is (844) 383-6477.

&#160;

The Fund&#8217;s Investment Objective 

&#160;

The Fund&#8217;s investment objective is to profit from rising interest rates by tracking the performance of a portfolio (the &#8220;Benchmark Portfolio&#8221;) consisting of exchange traded futures contracts and options on futures on 2, 5 and 10 year U.S. Treasury securities (&#8220;Treasury Instruments&#8221;) weighted to achieve a targeted negative 10 year average effective portfolio duration (the &#8220;Benchmark Component Instruments&#8221;). The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in the Benchmark Component Instruments currently constituting the Benchmark Portfolio. The Benchmark Portfolio is maintained by Sit Fixed Income Advisors II, LLC (&#8220;Sit&#8221;), which also serves as the Fund&#8217;s commodity trading advisor. The Benchmark Portfolio will be rebalanced, reconstituted, or both, monthly (typically on the 15 th of each month, or on the next business day if the 15 th is a holiday, weekend, or other day on which the national stock exchanges are closed) to maintain a negative 10 year average effective duration. The Benchmark Portfolio and the Fund will each maintain a short position in Treasury Instruments. The Fund does not use futures contracts or options to obtain leveraged investment results. The Fund will not invest in swaps or other over-the-counter derivative instruments.

&#160; 

The Sponsor 

&#160;

The Fund is managed and controlled by ETF Managers Capital LLC (the &#8220;Sponsor&#8221;), a single member limited liability company that was formed in the state of Delaware on June 12, 2014. The Fund pays the Sponsor a management fee (the &#8220;Management Fee&#8221;). The Sponsor maintains its main business office at 30 Maple Street - Suite 2, Summit, NJ 07901. The Sponsor&#8217;s telephone number is (844) 383-6477.

&#160;

The Fund is a &#8220;commodity pool&#8221; as defined by the Commodity Exchange Act (&#8220;CEA&#8221;). Consequently, the Sponsor has registered as a commodity pool operator (&#8220;CPO&#8221;) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;) and is a member of the National Futures Association (&#8220;NFA&#8221;).

&#160;

The Sponsor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Exchange Traded Managers Group LLC (&#8220;ETFMG&#8221;), a limited liability company domiciled and headquartered in New Jersey. 

&#160; 

The Commodity Trading Advisor 

&#160; 

Sit serves as the Fund&#8217;s commodity trading advisor (&#8220;CTA&#8221;). Sit is a Delaware limited liability company and a subsidiary of Sit Investment Associates, Inc. Sit Investment Associates, Inc. was founded in July 1981 by Eugene C. Sit and is a Minnesota corporation.

&#160;

Sit is registered as a CTA with the CFTC and is a member of the NFA.

&#160;

3&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Sit provides its services to the Fund under a Licensing and Services Agreement with the Sponsor. Under this agreement, Sit has agreed to compose and maintain the Benchmark Portfolio and license to the Sponsor the use of the Benchmark Portfolio.

&#160;

Significant Shareholders 

&#160; 

Prior to the Fund commencing operations, Sit made an initial investment of $5,000,000 in exchange for 200,000 shares of the Fund. As of June 30, 2016, Sit was the Fund&#8217;s primary shareholder. The shares purchased by Sit are redeemable by Sit on the same terms and conditions as those applicable to firms authorized to purchase and redeem Fund shares. If Sit were to redeem its shares before the Fund sells sufficient additional shares, such sale could have a material adverse affect on the Fund and its shareholders, including its ability to achieve its investment objective.

&#160;

Investing Strategy &#160;

&#160;

The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in the Benchmark Component Instruments currently constituting the Benchmark Portfolio. The weighting of the Treasury Instruments constituting the Benchmark Component Instruments will be based on each maturity&#8217;s duration contribution. The expected range for the duration weighted percentage of the 2 year and 5 year maturity Treasury Instruments will be from 30% to 70%. The expected range for the duration weighted percentage of the 10 year maturity Treasury Instruments will be from 5% to 25%.

&#160;

The relative weightings of the Benchmark Component Instruments will be shifted between maturities when there are material changes in the shape of the yield curve, for example, if the Federal Reserve began raising short term interest rates more than long term interest rates. In such an instance, Sit, which maintains the Benchmark Portfolio, will increase the weightings of the 2 year and reduce the weighting in the 10 year maturity Treasury Instruments. Conversely, Sit will do the opposite if the Federal Reserve began raising long term interest rates more than short term interest rates. Reconstitution, rebalancing, or both, each will occur monthly as discussed above or if there are radical changes in the yield curve such that effective duration is outside of a range from negative nine to negative 11-year average effective duration, in which case Sit will adjust the maturities of the Treasury Instruments before the next expected monthly reconstitution.

&#160;

The Sponsor anticipates that approximately 5% to 15% of the Fund&#8217;s assets will be used as payment for or collateral for Treasury Instruments. The Fund will post margin from such assets to its futures commission merchant (&#8220;FCM&#8221;), SG Americas Securities, LLC, in an amount equal to the margin required by the relevant exchange, and transfer to its FCM any additional amounts that may be separately required by the FCM. When establishing positions in Treasury Instruments, the Fund will be required to deposit initial margin with a value of approximately 3% to 10% of the value of each Treasury Instrument position at the time it is established. These margin requirements are subject to change from time to time by the exchange or the FCM. On a daily basis, the Fund will be obligated to pay, or entitled to receive, variation margin in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its Treasury Instruments positions. Any assets not required to be posted as margin with the FCM will be held at the Fund&#8217;s custodian in cash or cash equivalents.

&#160;

The Benchmark Portfolio will consist of the Benchmark Component Instruments and rebalanced, reconstituted, or both to maintain a negative average effective portfolio duration of approximately 10 years. Duration is a measure of estimated price sensitivity relative to changes in interest rates. Portfolios with longer durations are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates. For example, if interest rates rise by 1%, the market value of a security with an effective duration of 5 years would decrease by 5%, with all other factors being constant, and likewise, if interest rates decline by 1%, the market value of a security with an effective duration of negative 5 years would increase by 5%, with all other factors being constant. Duration estimates are based on assumptions by Sit and are subject to a number of limitations. Duration is a more accurate estimate of price sensitivity provided interest rate changes are small and occur equally in short-term and long-term securities. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk of a decrease in value is usually greater for longer-term debt securities.

&#160;

4&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Fund will incur certain expenses in connection with its operations. The Fund will hold cash or cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasuries or other high credit quality, short-term fixed-income or similar securities for direct investment or as collateral for the Treasury Instruments and for other liquidity purposes and to meet redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis. These expenses and income from the cash and cash equivalent holdings may cause imperfect correlation between changes in the Fund&#8217;s NAV and changes in the Benchmark Portfolio, because the Benchmark Portfolio does not reflect expenses or income.

&#160;

Sit expects that it will generally seek to close out its positions in Treasury futures contracts prior to such contracts maturing and enter into new positions in Treasury futures contracts. In connection with this process, natural market forces may affect the Fund&#8217;s NAV positively or negatively. This is because each time the Fund seeks to rebalance or reconstitute its positions, even absent movement in the underlying Treasury securities, the prices of new futures and option prices may be higher or lower than the prices of those that were closed out. Such differences in price, barring a movement in the price of the underlying security, will constitute &#8220;roll yield&#8221; and may inhibit the Fund&#8217;s ability to achieve its investment objective.

&#160;

Several factors may determine the total return from investing in a futures contract position. One factor that impacts the total return, which will result from investing in near month futures contracts and &#8220;rolling&#8221; those contracts forward each month, is the price relationship between the current near month contract and the next month contract. Among other such factors, when the Fund purchases an option that expires &#8220;out of the money,&#8221; the Fund will realize a loss. Additionally, the Fund may not be able to invest its assets in futures and options contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal to that which is required to achieve a negative 10 year average effective duration. For example, as standardized contracts, U.S. Treasury futures contracts are denominated in specific dollar amounts, and the Fund&#8217;s NAV and the proceeds from the sale of a Creation Basket are unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts. As a result, in such circumstances, the Fund may be better able to achieve the exact amount of exposure desired through the use of other investments.

&#160;

Sit will close existing positions when it determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvest the proceeds in other positions. Positions may also be closed out to meet orders for Redemption Baskets. 

&#160;

The Benchmark Portfolio 

&#160;

The Benchmark Portfolio is maintained by Sit and will be rebalanced, reconstituted, or both, monthly (typically on the 15th of each month or on the next business day if the 15th is a holiday, weekend, or other day on which the national exchanges are closed) to maintain a negative 10 year average effective duration. The Benchmark Portfolio and the Fund will each maintain a short position in Treasury Instruments. The Fund does not use futures contracts or options to obtain leveraged investment results. The Benchmark Component Instruments currently constituting the Benchmark Portfolio as of June 30, 2016 include:

&#160;

Name &#160; Ticker &#160; Market Value (USD) &#160; United States Treasury Bills &#160; 912796JL4 &#160; $ 16,241,128 &#160; U.S. 5YR FUTR OPTN AUG 16 C &#160; FVQ6C1215 &#160; &#160; (113,156 ) U.S. 5YR NOTE (CBT) SEP 16 &#160; FVU6 COMDTY &#160; &#160; (9,528,797 ) U.S. 2YR NOTE (CBT) SEP 16 &#160; TUU6 COMDTY &#160; &#160; (35,092,500 ) U.S. 10YR FUT OPTN AUG 16 P &#160; TYQ6P132 &#160; &#160; 14,875 &#160; &#160;

The Benchmark Component Instruments currently constituting the Benchmark Portfolio and anticipated rebalancing dates, as well as the daily holdings of the Fund, are available on the Fund&#8217;s website at www.risingrateetf.com.

&#160; 

Futures Contracts 

&#160;

The Fund enters into futures contracts to gain exposure to changes in the value of the Benchmark Portfolio. A futures contract obligates the seller to deliver (and the purchaser to accept) the future cash settlement of a specified quantity and type of the underlying treasury security at a specified time and place. The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller of a treasury futures contract may generally be satisfied by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery.

&#160;

5&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Upon entering into a futures contract, the Fund is required to deposit and maintain as collateral at least such initial margin as required by the exchange on which the transaction is affected. The initial margin is segregated as cash held by broker, as disclosed in the Statements of Financial Condition, and is restricted as to its use. Pursuant to the futures contract, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the futures contract. Such receipts or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains or losses. The Fund will realize a gain or loss upon closing a futures transaction.

&#160;

Futures contracts involve, to varying degrees, elements of market risk (specifically treasury price risk) and exposure to loss in excess of the amount of variation margin. The face or contract amounts reflect the extent of the total exposure the Fund has in the particular classes of instruments. Additional risks associated with the use of futures contracts include imperfect correlation between movements in the price of the futures contracts and the market value of the underlying securities and the possibility of an illiquid market for a futures contract. With futures contracts, there is minimal counterparty risk to the Fund since futures contracts are exchange-traded and the exchange&#8217;s clearinghouse, as counterparty to all exchange-traded futures contracts, guarantees the futures contracts against default. &#160; 

&#160; 

The Fund&#8217;s Trading Policies 

&#160;

Liquidity 

&#160;

The Fund invests principally in exchange traded futures and options on futures on U.S. Treasuries that, in the opinion of the Sponsor, are traded in sufficient volume to permit the ready taking of orders and liquidation of positions in these financial instruments.

&#160; 

Borrowings 

&#160; 

Borrowings are not undertaken by the Fund.

SG Americas Securities, LLC (&#8220;SGAS&#8221;) serves as the Fund&#8217;s clearing broker to execute and clear the Fund&#8217;s futures and options transactions and provide other brokerage-related services. SGAS is a futures commission merchant and broker dealer registered with the CFTC and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;), and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;).

&#160;

SGAS is headquartered at 245 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10167 with branch offices in Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California (securities only); and Montreal, Canada (futures only).

&#160;

On January 2, 2015, Newedge USA, LLC (&#8220;Newedge USA&#8221;) merged with and into SGAS, with the latter as the surviving entity.

&#160;

In January 2012, Newedge USA settled, without admitting or denying the allegations, a disciplinary action brought by the CFTC alleging that Newedge USA failed to file accurate and timely reports to the CFTC and failed to report certain large trader information to the CFTC. Newedge USA paid a $700,000 civil penalty to settle this matter. In addition, the CFTC Order required Newedge USA to timely submit accurate position reports and notices, and to implement and maintain procedures to prevent and detect reporting violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations.

&#160;

In July 2013, Newedge USA settled, without admitting or denying the allegations, a matter brought by FINRA, on its behalf and on behalf of NYSE/NYSE ARCA, BATS and NASDAQ exchanges, involving rules and regulations pertaining to supervision of equities direct market access and sponsored access business, Regulation SHO and books and records retention. In connection with this matter, Newedge USA paid a fine of $9,500,000. In addition, Newedge USA agreed to retain an independent consultant to review its policies, systems, procedures and training relating to these areas and to implement the recommendation of such consultant based on its review and written reports. 

&#160;

In February 2015, SGAS, as successor to Newedge USA, settled, without admitting or denying the allegations, a matter brought by CME Group alleging that on multiple occasions between 2010 and 2012, Newedge USA employees executed certain customers&#8217; orders as EFRPs, instead of on CME Group&#8217;s GLOBEX platform. The settlement also included allegations that EFRPs were non bona fide and/or inadequately documented. In connection with this matter, SGAS paid a fine of $1,100,000 to Comex and $650,000 to NYMEX.

&#160;

In October 2015, SGAS, as successor to Newedge USA, settled, without admitting or denying the allegations, a matter brought by ICE Futures U.S. that was based on alleged failures by Newedge USA to report an open interest in three energy futures contracts in accordance with the rules of the exchange over a period of approximately twenty-two business days in May and June 2014. In connection with this matter, SGAS paid a fine of $100,000.

&#160;

Beginning in late 2013, the SEC reviewed transactions by SGAS&#8217;s Non-Agency Mortgage Desk in which SGAS bought baskets of securities from a counterparty and sold the securities back to the same counterparty, and also reviewed communications with counterparties regarding certain riskless principal trades. The SEC reviewed transactions that occurred between approximately December 2011 and June 2013. SGAS cooperated with the investigation and disciplined the trader involved and her supervisor. In December 2015, SGAS paid $1,011,093 to settle the matter, consisting of a $800,000 fine and $211,093 in disgorgement including interest.

Fees of the Fund 

&#160; 

Management and CTA Fees 

&#160;

The Fund pays the Sponsor a management fee (the &#8220;Sponsor Fee&#8221;), monthly in arrears, in an amount equal to the greater of 0.15% per annum of the value of the Fund&#8217;s average daily net assets or $75,000 effective February 20, 2016, ($56,250 prior to February 20, 2016.) The Sponsor Fee is paid in consideration of the Sponsor&#8217;s advisory services to the Fund. The Fund also pays Sit a license and service fee (the &#8220;CTA Fee&#8221;) monthly in arrears, for the use of the Benchmark Portfolio in an amount equal to 0.50% per annum effective January 27, 2016 (0.35% prior to January 27, 2016) of the value of the Fund&#8217;s average daily net assets.

&#160;

As of February 19, 2015, Sit has agreed to waive its license and services fee and the Sponsor has voluntarily agreed to assume the remaining expenses of the Fund so that Fund expenses do not exceed an annual rate of 1.50%, excluding brokerage commissions, of the value of the Fund&#8217;s average daily net assets (the &#8220;Expense Cap&#8221;). The assumption of expenses and waiver of the license and services fee are contractual on the part of the Sponsor and Sit, respectively, through February 1, 2017. If after that date, the Sponsor and/or Sit no longer assumed expenses or waived the license and service fee, respectively, the Fund could be adversely impacted, including its ability to achieve its investment objective.

&#160;

The waiver of the license and service fee, pursuant to the undertaking, amounted to $58,846 and $7,515 for the year ended June 30, 2016 and the period from February 19, 2015 to June 30, 2015, respectively. The Fund currently accrues its daily expenses up to the Expense Cap. At the end of each month, the accrued amount is remitted to the Sponsor as the Sponsor has assumed, and is responsible for the payment of, the routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses of the Fund which aggregated $546,307 and $229,751, of which $258,585 and $185,816 was absorbed by the Sponsor, for the year ended June 30, 2016 and the period from February 19, 2015 to June 30, 2015, respectively.

Administrator, Custodian, Fund Accountant, and Transfer Agent 

&#160; 

For the first year of services, the Fund has agreed to pay U.S. Bank or U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, as the case may be, 0.05% of assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;), with a $45,000 minimum annual fee payable for its administrative, accounting and transfer agent services and 0.01% of AUM, with a minimum of $4,800 for custody services. Effective February 19, 2016, the Fund has agreed to pay U.S. Bank or U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, as the case may be, 0.05% of assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;), with a $50,000 minimum annual fee payable for its administrative, accounting and transfer agent services and 0.01% of AUM, with a minimum of $4,800 for custody services.

&#160;

Distributor 

&#160;

The Fund pays an annual fee for such distribution services and related administrative services equal to $15,000 plus 0.02% of the Fund&#8217;s average daily net assets, payable monthly. This fee has two components, with a portion of the fee paid to ALPS Distributors, Inc. for the statutory distribution services and a portion paid to the Sponsor for the related administrative services. Pursuant to the Marketing Agent Agreement between the Sponsor, the Fund and the Distributor, the Distributor assists the Sponsor and the Fund with certain functions and duties relating to distribution and marketing services to the Fund, including reviewing and approving marketing materials and certain regulatory compliance matters. The Distributor also assists with the processing of creation and redemption orders.

&#160;

The Distributor is paid a minimum annual fee of $15,000 by the Fund of the Fund&#8217;s average monthly net asset value. For the year ended June 30, 2016 and the period from February 19, 2015 to June 30, 2015 the Fund incurred $17,117 and $5,425, respectively, in distribution fees and services which is included in the Statements of Operations.

&#160;

Futures Commission Merchant 

&#160; 

The Fund pays respective brokerage commissions, including applicable exchange fees, National Futures Association (&#8220;NFA&#8221;) fees, give&#8211;up fees, pit brokerage fees and other transaction related fees and expenses charged in connection with trading activities in CFTC regulated investments. Brokerage commissions on futures contracts are recognized on a half-turn basis.

&#160;

The Sponsor does not expect brokerage commissions and fees to exceed 0.126% of the net asset value of the Fund for execution and clearing services on behalf of the Fund, although the actual amount of brokerage commissions and fees in any year or any part of any year may be greater. The effects of trading spreads, financing costs associated with financial instruments, and costs relating to the purchase of U.S. Treasury Instruments or similar high credit quality short-term fixed-income or similar securities are not included in the forgoing analysis. For the year ended June 30, 2016 and the period from February 19, 2015 to June 30, 2015, the Fund incurred $27,382 and $4,171, respectively, in Brokerage Commissions and fees as disclosed in the Statements of Operations.

&#160; 

Other Fees 

&#160;

The Fund will be responsible for its Other Expenses, including professional services (e.g., outside auditor&#8217;s fees and legal fees and expenses), tax and shareholder information return preparation, regulatory compliance, and other services provided by affiliated and non-affiliated service providers. The amount of such Other Expenses is estimated to be .85% annually through February 1, 2017 due to the Expense Cap. After such date, the Expense Cap may be terminated and the Fund&#8217;s Other Expenses could be higher, perhaps significantly higher.

Instead, shares are represented by one or more global certificates, which are deposited by the Administrator with, or on behalf of, DTC and registered in the name of Cede &#38; Co., as nominee for DTC. The global certificates evidence all of the shares outstanding at any time. Shareholders are limited to (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies (&#8220;DTC Participants&#8221;), (2) banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with, or clear through, a DTC Participant (&#8220;Indirect Participants&#8221;), and (3) persons holding interests in the shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants, in each case who satisfy the requirements for transfers of shares.

&#160;

Shareholders will be shown on, and the transfer of Shares will be effected only through, in the case of DTC Participants, the records maintained by the Depository and, in the case of Indirect Participants and Shareholders holding through a DTC Participant or an Indirect participant, through those records or the records of the relevant DTC Participants or Indirect participants. Shareholders are expected to receive, from or through which the Shareholder has purchased Shares, a written confirmation relating to their purchase of Shares.

&#160; 

DTC 

&#160; 

DTC is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, a &#8220;clearing corporation&#8221; within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a &#8220;clearing agency&#8221; registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds securities for DTC Participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between DTC Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of DTC Participants.

&#160; 

Calculating NAV 

&#160;

The Fund&#8217;s NAV is calculated by:

&#160;

&#183; Taking the current market value of its total assets; &#160;

&#183; Subtracting any liabilities; and &#160;

&#183; Dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares. &#160;

The Administrator calculates the NAV of the Fund once each NYSE Arca trading day. The NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. The Administrator uses the CME closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the CME or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts traded on the CME, but calculates or determines the value of all other Fund investments using market quotations, if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time, in accordance with the current Administrative Agency Agreement among U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, the Fund and the Sponsor. &#8220;Other information&#8221; customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including, without limitation, relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities, spreads, correlations or other market data in the relevant market; or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by the Fund in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions. The information may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized. Third parties supplying quotations or market data may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information.

&#160;

10&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, in order to provide updated information relating to the Fund for use by investors and market professionals, the NYSE Arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value. The indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day&#8217;s closing NAV per share of the Fund as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the futures and options held by the Fund traded on the CME. The indicative fund value share basis disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the NAV, because the NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of the Fund&#8217;s investments.

&#160;

The indicative fund value is disseminated on a per share basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m. New York time to 4:00 p.m. New York time. The normal trading hours of the CME are 10:00 a.m. New York time to 2:30 p.m. New York time. This means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which the Fund&#8217;s shares are traded on the NYSE Arca, but real-time CME trading prices for contracts traded on the CME are not available. During such gaps in time the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such contracts from the CME&#8217;s immediately preceding trading session. In addition, other investments and U.S. Treasuries held by the Fund will be valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes. These investments will not be included in the indicative fund value.

&#160;

The NYSE Arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines. In addition, the indicative fund value is published on the NYSE Arca&#8217;s website and is available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.

&#160;

Dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of the Fund shares on the NYSE Arca. Investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of the Fund and the indicative fund value. If the market price of the Fund shares diverges significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades. For example, if the Fund appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value, a market professional could buy the Fund shares on the NYSE Arca and take the opposite position in Treasury Instruments. Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of the Fund and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants.

&#160;

Creation and Redemption of Shares 

&#160; 

The Fund creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets. The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to the Fund or the distribution by the Fund of the amount of Treasuries and any cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.

&#160;

Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets. Authorized Participants must be (1) registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions described below, and (2) DTC Participants. To become an Authorized Participant, a person must enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Sponsor. The Authorized Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the Treasuries and any cash required for such creation and redemptions. The Authorized Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by the Fund, without the consent of any limited partner or shareholder or Authorized Participant. Authorized Participants will pay a transaction fee of $500 to the Custodian for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets. Authorized Participants who make deposits with the Fund in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the Fund or the Sponsor, and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor or the Fund to effect any sale or resale of shares.

&#160;

11&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Certain Authorized Participants are expected to be capable of participating directly in the Treasury market and the related derivatives market. In some cases, Authorized Participants or their affiliates may from time to time buy or sell Treasuries and related derivatives and may profit in these instances. The Sponsor believes that the size and operation of the Treasury market make it unlikely that an Authorized Participant&#8217;s direct activities in such markets will significantly affect the price of Treasuries, related derivatives or the price of the shares.

&#160;

Each Authorized Participant is required to be registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and be a member in good standing with FINRA, or exempt from being or otherwise not required to be registered as a broker-dealer or a member of FINRA, and qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires. Certain Authorized Participants may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations. Each Authorized Participant has its own set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime.

&#160;

Under the Authorized Participant Agreement, the Sponsor has agreed to indemnify the Authorized Participants against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the 1933 Act, and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Participants may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

&#160;

Creation Procedures 

&#160; 

On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Distributor to create one or more baskets. For purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders, a &#8220;business day&#8221; means any day other than a day when any of the NYSE Arca, the CME or the New York Stock Exchange is closed for regular trading. Purchase orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier. The day on which the Distributor receives a valid purchase order is referred to as the purchase order date. By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit U.S. Treasuries, cash or a combination of U.S. Treasuries and cash, as described below. Prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order.

&#160;

The manner by which creations are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement. By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit U.S. Treasuries, cash, or a combination of U.S. Treasuries and cash with the Custodian of the Fund. If an Authorized Participant fails to so deposit, the order shall be cancelled.

&#160;

Determination of Required Deposits 

&#160; 

The total deposit required to create each basket (&#8220;Creation Basket Deposit&#8221;) is the amount of U.S. Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of the Fund (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the purchase order date as the number of shares to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the purchase order date. The Sponsor determines, directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the Administrator, the requirements for U.S. Treasuries and the amount of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury and proportions of each Treasury and cash that may be included in deposits to create baskets. The Distributor will publish such requirements at the beginning of each business day. The amount of cash deposit required is the difference between the aggregate market value of the U.S. Treasuries required to be included in a Creation Basket Deposit as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the order to purchase is properly received and the total required deposit.

&#160;

Delivery of Required Deposits 

&#160; 

An Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring to the Fund&#8217;s account with the Custodian the required amount of U.S. Treasuries and cash by the end of the third business day following the purchase order date. Upon receipt of the deposit amount, the Administrator directs DTC to credit the number of shares represented by the baskets ordered to the Authorized Participant&#8217;s DTC account on the third business day following the purchase order date. The expense and risk of delivery and ownership of U.S. Treasuries until such U.S. Treasuries have been received by the Custodian on behalf of the Fund is borne solely by the Authorized Participant.

&#160;

12&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Because orders to purchase baskets must be placed by 12:00 p.m., New York time, but the total payment required to create a basket during the continuous offering period will not be determined until after 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the date the purchase order is received, Authorized Participants will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable purchase order for the basket. The Fund&#8217;s NAV and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise or fall substantially between the time a purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price in respect thereof is determined.

&#160;

Rejection of Purchase Orders 

&#160;

The Sponsor acting by itself or through the Distributor shall have the absolute right but no obligation to reject a purchase order or a Creation Basket Deposit if:

&#160;

&#183; it determines that the investment alternative available to the Fund at that time will not enable it to meet its investment objective; &#160;

&#183; it determines that the purchase order or the Creation Basket Deposit is not in proper form; &#160;

&#183; it believes that the purchase order or the Creation Basket Deposit would have adverse tax consequences to the Fund, the limited partners or its shareholders; &#160;

&#183; the acceptance or receipt of the Creation Basket Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel to the Sponsor, be unlawful; or &#160;

&#183; circumstances outside the control of the Sponsor, Distributor or Custodian make it, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process creations of baskets. &#160;

None of the Sponsor, Distributor or Custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit.

&#160; 

Redemption Procedures 

&#160; 

The procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets. On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Distributor to redeem one or more baskets. Redemption orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier. A redemption order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Distributor. The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual shareholder to redeem any shares in an amount less than a Redemption Basket, or to redeem baskets other than through an Authorized Participant.

&#160;

By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through DTC&#8217;s book-entry system to the Fund, as described below. Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Fund&#8217;s account at the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order.

&#160;

The manner by which redemptions are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement. By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to (1) deliver the Redemption Basket to be redeemed through DTC&#8217;s book-entry system to the Fund&#8217;s account with the Custodian not later than 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the effective date of the redemption order (&#8220;Redemption Distribution Date&#8221;), and (2) if required by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for related position, or any other transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with the Fund for the sale of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the Redemption Order Date. If an Authorized Participant fails to consummate (1) and (2) above, the order shall be cancelled. The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by the Sponsor, in its sole discretion, to meet the Fund&#8217;s investment objective and shall be sold as a result of the Authorized Participant&#8217;s redemption of shares.

&#160;

13&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Determination of Redemption Distribution 

&#160; 

The redemption distribution from the Fund consists of a transfer to the redeeming Authorized Participant of an amount of U.S. Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of the Fund (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of shares to be redeemed under the redemption order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the date the order is received. The Sponsor, directly or in consultation with the Administrator, determines the requirements for U.S. Treasuries and the amounts of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury, and the proportions of U.S. Treasuries and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets. The Distributor will publish an estimate of the redemption distribution value per basket as of the beginning of each business day.

&#160;

Delivery of Redemption Distribution 

&#160; 

The redemption distribution due from the Fund will be delivered to the Authorized Participant by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if, by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such third business day, the Fund&#8217;s DTC account has been credited with the shares represented by the baskets to be redeemed. If the Fund&#8217;s DTC account has not been credited with all of the shares represented by the baskets to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received. Any remainder of the redemption distribution will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining shares represented by the whole baskets received if the Fund receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which the Sponsor may, from time to time, determine and the remaining baskets to be redeemed are credited to the Fund&#8217;s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such next business day. Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order will be cancelled. Pursuant to information from the Sponsor, the Custodian will also be authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to the Fund&#8217;s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized its obligation to deliver the baskets through DTC&#8217;s book entry-system on such terms as the Sponsor may from time to time determine.

&#160;

Suspension or Rejection of Redemption Orders 

&#160; 

The Sponsor may, in its discretion, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date, (1) for any period during which the NYSE Arca or the CME is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on the NYSE Arca or the CME is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of U.S. Treasuries is not reasonably practicable, or (3) for such other period as the Sponsor determines to be necessary for the protection of the limited partners or shareholders. For example, the Sponsor may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of the Fund&#8217;s assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption. If the Sponsor has difficulty liquidating its positions, e.g., because of a market disruption event in the futures markets or a suspension of trading by the exchange where the futures contracts are listed, it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified. None of the Sponsor, the Distributor, the Administrator, or the Custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement. Redemption orders must be made in whole baskets. The Sponsor will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Authorized Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful. The Sponsor may also reject a redemption order if the number of shares being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding shares to 100,000 shares (minimum NYSE Arca listing requirement) or less, unless the Sponsor has reason to believe that the placer of the redemption order does in fact possess all the outstanding shares and can deliver them.

&#160;

14&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee 

&#160; 

To compensate the Fund for its expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets, an Authorized Participant is required to pay a transaction fee to the Custodian of $500 per order to create or redeem baskets, regardless of the number of baskets in such order. An order may include multiple baskets. The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by the Sponsor. The Sponsor will notify DTC of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice.

&#160;

Tax Responsibility 

&#160; 

Authorized Participants are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Participant, and agree to indemnify the Sponsor and the Fund if they are required by law to pay any such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax and interest thereon.

&#160;

Secondary Market Transactions 

&#160; 

As noted, the Fund creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets. The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to the Fund or the distribution by the Fund of the amount of U.S. Treasuries and cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which will be based on the aggregate net asset value (NAV) of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.

&#160;

As discussed above, Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets. Authorized Participants must be registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions. An Authorized Participant is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets, and an Authorized Participant is under no obligation to offer to the public shares of any baskets it does create. Authorized Participants that do offer to the public shares from the baskets they create will do so at per share offering prices that are expected to reflect, among other factors, the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca, the NAV of the Fund at the time the Authorized Participant purchased the Creation Baskets and the NAV of the shares at the time of the offer of the shares to the public, the supply of and demand for shares at the time of sale, and the liquidity of the futures contract market and the market for Treasury Investments. The prices of shares offered by Authorized Participants are expected to fall between the Fund&#8217;s NAV and the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca at the time of sale.

&#160;

Shares initially comprising the same basket but offered by Authorized Participants to the public at different times may have different offering prices. An order for one or more baskets may be placed by an Authorized Participant on behalf of multiple clients. Authorized Participants that make deposits with the Fund in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the Fund or the Sponsor, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor or the Fund to effect any sale or resale of shares.

&#160;

Shares trade in the secondary market on the NYSE Arca. Shares may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher relative to their NAV per share. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per share may be influenced by various factors, including the number of investors who seek to purchase or sell shares in the secondary market and the liquidity of the futures contracts market and the market for Treasury Investments. While the shares trade during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New York time, liquidity in the market for Treasury Instruments may be reduced after the close of the CME at 2:30 p.m. New York time. As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the shares may widen.

&#160; 

15&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Regulatory Environment 

&#160;

The regulation of futures markets, futures contracts, and futures exchanges has historically been comprehensive. The CFTC and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits, increased margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading.

&#160;

The regulation of commodity interest transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action. Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the United States. There is a possibility of future regulatory changes within the United States altering, perhaps to a material extent, the nature of an investment in the Fund, or the ability of the Fund to continue to implement its investment strategy. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Fund is impossible to predict but could be substantial and adverse.

&#160;

The CFTC possesses exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the activities of commodity pool operators and has adopted regulations with respect to the activities of those persons and/or entities. Under the CEA, a registered CPO, such as the Sponsor, is required to make annual filings with the CFTC describing its organization, capital structure, management and controlling persons. In addition, the CEA authorizes the CFTC to require and review books and records of, and documents prepared by, registered CPOs. Pursuant to this authority, the CFTC requires CPOs to keep accurate, current and orderly records for each pool that they operate. The CFTC may suspend the registration of a commodity pool operator (1) if the CFTC finds that the operator&#8217;s trading practices tend to disrupt orderly market conditions, (2) if any controlling person of the operator is subject to an order of the CFTC denying such person trading privileges on any exchange, and (3) in certain other circumstances. Suspension, restriction or termination of the Sponsor&#8217;s registration as a commodity pool operator would prevent it, until that registration were to be reinstated, from managing the Fund, and might result in the termination of the Fund if a successor sponsor is not elected pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

&#160;

The Fund&#8217;s investors are afforded prescribed rights for reparations under the CEA. Investors may also be able to maintain a private right of action for violations of the CEA. The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the CEA, which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the CFTC for violation of the CEA against a floor broker or an FCM, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, CPO, and their respective associated persons.

&#160;

Pursuant to authority in the CEA, the NFA has been formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association. At the present time, the NFA is the only self-regulatory organization for commodity interest professionals, other than futures exchanges. The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of CPOs and FCMs and their respective associated persons. The Sponsor and the Fund&#8217;s clearing broker are members of the NFA. As such, they will be subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition and consumer protection. The NFA also arbitrates disputes between members and their customers and conducts registration and fitness screening of applicants for membership and audits of its existing members. Neither the Trust nor the Fund is required to become a member of the NFA.

&#160;

The regulations of the CFTC and the NFA prohibit any representation by a person registered with the CFTC or by any member of the NFA, that registration with the CFTC, or membership in the NFA, in any respect indicates that the CFTC or the NFA has approved or endorsed that person or that person&#8217;s trading program or objectives. The registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered as constituting any such approval or endorsement. Likewise, no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or endorsement.

&#160;

Futures exchanges in the United States are subject to varying degrees of regulation under the CEA depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market, exempt board of trade or electronic trading facility. Clearing organizations are also subject to the CEA and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder as administered by the CFTC. The CFTC&#8217;s function is to implement the CEA&#8217;s objectives of preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets. In addition, the various exchanges and clearing organizations themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms.

&#160;

16&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) was enacted in response to the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009 and it significantly altered the regulatory regime to which the securities and commodities markets are subject. To date, the CFTC has issued proposed versions of all of the rules it is required to promulgate under the Dodd-Frank Act, and it continues to issue proposed versions of additional rules that it has authority to promulgate. The provisions of the law include the requirement that position limits be established on a wide range of commodity interests, including agricultural, energy, and metal-based commodity futures contracts, options on such futures contracts and cleared and uncleared swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures contracts and options; new registration and recordkeeping requirements for swap market participants; capital and margin requirements for &#8220;swap dealers&#8221; and &#8220;major swap participants,&#8221; as determined by the law and applicable regulations; and the mandatory use of clearinghouse mechanisms for sufficiently standardized swap transactions that were historically entered into in the over-the-counter market.

&#160;

In addition to the rules and regulations imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain participants that are European banks may also be subject to European Market Infrastructure Regulation. These regulations have not yet been fully implemented.

&#160;

Current rules and regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs. The rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner.

&#160;

The effect of future regulatory change on the Fund, and the exact timing of such changes, is impossible to predict but it may be substantial and adverse. Specifically, the law, the rules that have been promulgated thereunder, and the rules that are expected to be promulgated may negatively impact the ability of the Fund to meet its investment objectives, either through position limits or requirements imposed on it and/or on their counterparties. In particular, new position limits imposed on a Fund or any counterparties may impact the ability of that Fund to invest in a manner that most efficiently meets its investment objective. New requirements, including capital imposed on the counterparties of a Fund may increase the cost of that Fund&#8217;s investments and doing business.

&#160;

In addition, considerable regulatory attention has recently been focused on non-traditional publicly distributed investment pools such as the Fund. Furthermore, various national governments have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in certain commodity markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Fund is impossible to predict, but could be substantial and adverse.

&#160;

Management believes that as of June 30, 2016 it had fulfilled in a timely manner all Dodd-Frank reporting requirements, both historical and on-going, for the categories under which the firm operates and is registered.
