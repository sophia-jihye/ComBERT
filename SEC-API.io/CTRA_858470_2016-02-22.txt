 ITEMS 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES 

Cabot Oil &#38; Gas Corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development, exploitation and exploration of oil and gas properties. Our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources, which are conducive to multi-well, repeatable drilling programs. We operate in one segment, natural gas and oil development, exploitation, exploration and production, in the continental United States. We have offices located in Houston, Texas and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 

STRATEGY 

Our objective is to enhance shareholder value over the long-term through consistent growth in production and reserves. We believe this is attainable, even in the current commodity price environment, by employing a combination of disciplined management and remaining focused on our core asset base, which offers a strategic advantage. Key components of our business strategy include: 

Disciplined Capital Spending Focused on Organic Projects. We allocate our capital program based on economic projects that we expect will enable us to maximize our production and reserve growth. Our capital program is based on the expectation of being fully funded through operating cash flows, with any shortfalls funded by borrowings under our revolving credit facility. While we consider various growth opportunities, including strategic acquisitions, our primary focus is organic growth through drilling our core areas of operation where we believe we can exploit our extensive inventory of low-cost, repeatable drilling opportunities. The price we expect to receive for our production is a critical factor in the capital investments we make in order to develop our properties. 

Low Cost Structure. Our operations are focused on select unconventional plays with significant resource potential that allow us to add and produce reserves at a low cost. We have developed sizable, contiguous acreage positions in our core operating areas and believe the concentration of our assets allows us to further reduce costs through economies of scale. We continue to optimize drilling and completion efficiencies through the use of multi-well pad drilling in our core operating areas, resulting in additional cost savings. Furthermore, since we operate in a limited number of geographic areas, we believe we can leverage our technical expertise in these areas to achieve further cost reductions through operational efficiencies. We also operate a majority of our properties, which allows us to more effectively manage all elements of our cost structure. 

Conservative Financial Position and Financial Flexibility. We believe the prudent management of our balance sheet and the active management of commodity price risk allows us the financial flexibility to continue to provide consistent production and reserve growth over time, even in periods of depressed commodity prices. From time to time, we utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risk and to provide a level of cash flow predictability. In the event we experience a lower than anticipated commodity price environment, we believe that we have the flexibility to supplement the funding of our capital program with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and select asset sales. 

Pursue Strategic Marketing and Transportation Agreements to Maximize Cash Flows and Diversify Risk. We continue to pursue opportunities to maximize our cash flows and diversify our market and customer risk by securing strategic long-term firm transportation and sales contracts in close proximity to our core area of operations. &#32; 

2016 &#32;OUTLOOK 

Our 2016 &#32;drilling program includes approximately $325.0 million &#32;in capital expenditures and approximately $150.0 million &#32;in expected contributions to our equity method investments. We expect to fund these expenditures with operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. See Note 4 &#32;of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our equity method investments in Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC (Constitution) and Meade Pipeline Co LLC (Meade). 

We plan to drill approximately 30 &#32;gross wells ( 30.0 &#32;net) in 2016 &#32;compared to 142 &#32;gross wells ( 132.8 &#32;net) drilled in 2015 . We allocate our planned capital program among our various operating areas based on return expectations, availability of services and human resources. We will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital expenditures accordingly. 

As a result of sustained lower natural gas and crude oil prices expected during 2016 , we reduced our budgeted capital expenditures compared to 2015. In addition, we plan to operate an average of approximately 1.3 rigs in 2016 , a decrease from an average of approximately 5.4 rigs in 2015 . During 2015 , we strategically curtailed production levels in the Marcellus Shale due to lower price realizations in the region, and we expect to continue to strategically curtail production during 2016 &#32;given the current commodity price environment. 

DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES 

Our exploration, development and production operations are primarily concentrated in two unconventional plays&#8212;the Marcellus Shale in northeast Pennsylvania and the Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas. We also have operations in various other conventional and unconventional plays throughout the continental United States. 

Marcellus Shale 

Our Marcellus Shale properties represent our largest operating and growth area in terms of reserves, production and capital investment. Our properties are principally located in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, where we currently hold approximately 200,000 net acres in the dry gas window of the play. Our 2015 &#32;net production in the Marcellus Shale was 540.8 &#32;Bcfe, representing approximately 90% of our total equivalent production for the year. As of December 31, 2015 , we had a total of 548.1 net wells in the Marcellus Shale, of which approximately 99% are operated by us. 

During 2015 , we invested $457.0 million in the Marcellus Shale and drilled or participated in drilling 82.5 net wells and turned in line 64.0 net wells. As of December 31, 2015 , we had 66.8 net wells that were either in the completion stage or waiting on completion or connection to a pipeline. We exited 2015 &#32;with two drilling rigs operating in the play and plan to exit 2016 &#32;with one rig operating. 

Eagle Ford Shale 

Our properties in the Eagle Ford Shale are principally located in Atascosa, Frio and La Salle Counties, Texas, where we hold approximately 85,500 net acres in the oil window of the play. In 2015 , our net crude oil/condensate/NGL and natural gas production from the Eagle Ford Shale was 5,797 Mbbl and 1.8 Bcf, respectively, or 36.6 Bcfe, representing approximately 6% of our total equivalent production. As of December 31, 2015 , we had a total of 221.2 net wells in the Eagle Ford, of which approximately 85% are operated by us. 

During 2015 , we invested $303.4 million in the Eagle Ford Shale and drilled or participated in drilling 49.3 net wells and turned in line 44.3 net wells. As of December 31, 2015 , we had 23.0 net wells that were waiting on completion. We exited 2015 &#32;with one drilling rig operating in the play and plan to exit 2016 &#32;with one rig operating. 

Other Oil and Gas Properties 

In addition to our core unconventional resource plays, we also operate or participate in other conventional and unconventional plays throughout the continental United States, including the Devonian Shale, Big Lime, Weir and Berea in West Virginia; the Cotton Valley, Haynesville, Bossier, and James Lime formations in east Texas; and the Utica Shale in Pennsylvania. 

Other Properties 

Ancillary to our exploration, development and production operations, we operate a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems, made up of approximately 3,100 &#32;miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems, four local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2015 . The majority of our pipeline infrastructure is located in West Virginia and is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for interstate transportation service and the West Virginia Public Service Commission (WVPSC) for intrastate transportation service. As such, the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary, Cranberry Pipeline Corporation, are subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC and the WVPSC. Our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems in West Virginia enable us to connect new wells quickly and transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines, local distribution companies and industrial end users. Control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase, transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties. In addition, we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system. 

We also have two natural gas storage fields located in West Virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 Bcf. We use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas typically associated with winter natural gas sales, while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year. The pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations in West Virginia. 

ACQUISITIONS 

In December 2014, we completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas for approximately $30.5 million . Total cash consideration paid was approximately $29.9 million , which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs. 

In October 2014, we purchased certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas for approximately $210.0 million . Total cash consideration paid at closing was approximately $185.2 million , which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs. In April 2015, we completed the acquisition of the remaining oil and gas properties for which the seller was unable to obtain consents at closing for approximately $16.0 million . 

DIVESTITURES 

In October 2014, we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east Texas to a third party for approximately $44.3 million &#32;and recognized a $19.9 million &#32;gain on sale of assets. 

In December 2013, we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles to Chaparral Energy, L.L.C. for approximately $160.0 million and recognized a $19.4 million &#32;gain on sale of assets. We also sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas to a third party for approximately $123.4 million and recognized a $17.5 million &#32;loss on sale of assets. 

In 2013, we sold various other proved and unproved oil and gas properties for approximately $44.3 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of $19.5 million. 

In 2012, we sold certain unproved oil and gas properties and other assets for approximately $169.3 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of $50.6 million. 

In 2011, we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties and other assets for approximately $405.5 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of $63.4 million. 

MARKETING 

Substantially all of our natural gas is sold at market sensitive prices under both long-term and short-term sales contracts. The principal markets for our natural gas are in the northeastern United States and the industrialized Gulf Coast area. In the northeastern United States, we sell natural gas to industrial customers, local distribution companies and gas marketers. In the Gulf Coast area, we sell natural gas to intrastate pipelines, natural gas processors and marketing companies. Properties in the Gulf Coast area are connected to various processing plants in Texas and Louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries, affording us access to multiple markets. 

We also incur transportation and gathering expenses to move our natural gas production from the wellhead to our principal markets in the United States. The majority of our natural gas production is transported on third-party gathering systems and interstate pipelines where we have long-term contractual capacity arrangements or use purchaser-owned capacity under both long-term and short-term sales contracts. 

To date, we have not experienced significant difficulty in transporting or marketing our natural gas production as it becomes available; however, there is no assurance that we will always be able to transport and market all of our production. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

From time to time, we use derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production. While there are many different types of derivatives available, we generally utilize collar and swap agreements designed to manage price risk more effectively. The collar arrangements are a combination of put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of natural gas or crude oil production during a certain time period. They provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor. The swap agreements call for payments to, or receipts from, counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the particular period under the swap agreement. 

During 2015 , natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from $3.86 &#32;to $3.91 &#32;per Mcf and ceiling prices ranging from $4.27 &#32;to $4.43 &#32;per Mcf covered 70.9 &#32;Bcf, or 13% , of our natural gas production at a weighted-average price of $3.87 &#32;per Mcf. Natural gas swaps covered 107.3 &#32;Bcf, or 19% , of our natural gas production at a weighted-average price of $3.79 &#32;per Mcf. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we did not have any outstanding commodity derivatives. In January 2016, we entered into natural gas swaps covering 52.0 &#32;Bcf of our expected natural gas production from April 2016 &#32;through October 2016 &#32;at a weighted-average price of $2.51 &#32;per Mcf. A significant portion of our expected natural gas and crude oil production for 2016 and beyond is currently unhedged and directly exposed to the volatility in natural gas and crude oil market prices, whether favorable or unfavorable. We will continue to evaluate the benefit of using derivatives in the future. Please read "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" for further discussion related to our use of derivatives.

_______________________________________________________________________________ 

(1) 

Proved undeveloped reserves for 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;include reserves drilled but awaiting completion of 937.4 &#32;Bcfe, 501.1 Bcfe and 239.1 Bcfe, respectively. 

(2) 

NGL reserves were less than 1.0% &#32;of our total proved equivalent reserves for 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , and 16.1% , 13.5% and 12.3% of our proved crude oil and NGL reserves for 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

(3) 

Natural gas equivalents are determined using a ratio of 6 Mcf of natural gas to 1 Bbl of crude oil, condensate or NGLs. 

(4) 

Reserve life index is equal to year-end proved reserves divided by annual production for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Our proved reserves totaled approximately 8,190 &#32;Bcfe at December 31, 2015 , of which 96% were natural gas. This reserve level was up by 11% from 7,401 &#32;Bcfe at December 31, 2014 . In 2015 , we added 965.4 Bcfe of proved reserves through extensions, discoveries and other additions, primarily due to the positive results from our drilling program in the Dimock field in northeast Pennsylvania. We also had a net upward revision of 425.6 &#32;Bcfe, which was primarily due to an upward performance revision of 702.9 &#32;Bcfe associated with positive drilling results in our Dimock field in northeast Pennsylvania, partially offset by a downward revision of 277.3 &#32;Bcfe associated with lower commodity prices. In 2015 , we produced 602.5 Bcfe. 

Our reserves are sensitive to natural gas and crude oil prices and their effect on the economic productive life of producing properties. Our reserves are based on the 12-month average crude oil and natural gas index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during the year. Increases in commodity prices may result in a longer economic productive life of a property or result in more economically viable proved undeveloped reserves to be recognized. Decreases in prices may result in negative impacts of this nature. 

For additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves, the audit of such estimates by Miller and Lents, Ltd. (Miller and Lents) and other information about our reserves, including the risks inherent in our estimates of proved reserves, see the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 and &#8220;Risk Factors-Our proved reserves are estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated&#8221; in Item 1A. 

Technologies Used In Reserves Estimates 

We utilize various traditional methods to estimate our crude oil and natural gas reserves, including decline curve extrapolations, material balance calculations, volumetric calculations and analogies, and in some cases a combination of these methods. In addition, at times we may use seismic interpretations to confirm continuity of a formation in combination with traditional technologies; however, seismic interpretations are not used in the volumetric computation. 

Internal Control 

Our Vice President, Engineering and Technology is the technical person responsible for our internal reserves estimation process and provides oversight of our corporate reservoir engineering department, which consists of three engineers, and the annual audit of our year-end reserves by Miller and Lents. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering, specializing in petroleum engineering, and over 33 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in operations, engineering and evaluations. He has worked in the area of reserves and reservoir engineering for 24 years and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. 

Our reserves estimation process is coordinated by our corporate reservoir engineering department. Reserve information, including models and other technical data, are stored on secured databases on our network. Certain non-technical inputs used in the reserves estimation process, including commodity prices, production and development costs and ownership percentages, are obtained by other departments and are subject to testing as part of our annual internal control process. We also engage Miller and Lents, independent petroleum engineers, to perform an independent audit of our estimated proved reserves. Upon completion of the process, the estimated reserves are presented to senior management. 

Miller and Lents made independent estimates for 100% of our proved reserves estimates and concluded, in their judgment, we have an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved reserves and project our future revenues. Further, Miller and Lents has concluded (1) the reserves estimation methods employed by us were appropriate, and our classification of such reserves was appropriate to the relevant SEC reserve definitions, (2) our reserves estimation processes were comprehensive and of sufficient depth, (3) the data upon which we relied were adequate and of sufficient quality, and (4) the results of our estimates and projections are, in the aggregate, reasonable. A copy of the audit letter by Miller and Lents dated January 26, 2016, has been filed as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. 

Qualifications of Third Party Engineers 

The technical person primarily responsible for the audit of our reserves estimates at Miller and Lents meets the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity, and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Miller and Lents is an independent firm of petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists, and petro physicists; they do not own an interest in our properties and are not employed on a contingent fee basis. 

Proved Undeveloped Reserves 

At December 31, 2015 &#32;we had 3,361.2 &#32;Bcfe of proved undeveloped (PUD) reserves associated with future development costs of $1.6 billion, which represents an increase of 462.9 &#32;Bcfe compared to December 31, 2014 . We expect to develop approximately 60% to 70% of our PUD reserves over the next three years, of which 937.4 &#32;Bcfe have been drilled and are waiting on completion. Future development plans are reflective of the significant decrease in commodity prices and have been established based on an expectation of available cash flows from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2015 , all PUD reserves are expected to be developed within five years of initial disclosure of these reserves. 

The following table is a reconciliation of the change in our PUD reserves (Bcfe):

Changes in PUD reserves that occurred during the year were due to: 

&#8226; 

transfer of 662.9 &#32;Bcfe from PUD to proved developed reserves based on total capital expenditures of $459.6 million during 2015 ; 

&#8226; 

new PUD reserve additions of 685.1 &#32;Bcfe primarily in the Dimock field in northeast Pennsylvania; and 

&#8226; 

positive PUD reserve revisions of 440.2 &#32;Bcfe resulting from positive performance revisions of 453.8 Bcfe associated with the drilling of longer lateral wells and completing more frac stages in our Dimock field in northeast Pennsylvania, partially offset by negative price revisions of 13.6 Bcfe.

ACREAGE 

Our interest in both developed and undeveloped properties is primarily in the form of leasehold interests held under customary mineral leases. These leases provide us the right to develop oil and/or natural gas on the properties. Their primary terms range in length from approximately three to 10 years. These properties are held for longer periods if production is established. 

The following table summarizes our gross and net developed and undeveloped leasehold and mineral fee acreage at December 31, 2015 .

Total Net Undeveloped Acreage Expiration 

In the event that production is not established or we take no action to extend or renew the terms of our leases, our net undeveloped acreage that will expire over the next three years as of December 31, 2015 &#32;is 66,586, 86,252 and 38,501 for the years ending December 31, 2016 , 2017 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. 

We expect to retain substantially all of our expiring acreage either through drilling activities, renewal of the expiring leases or through the exercise of extension options. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 32% of our expiring acreage disclosed above is located in our core areas of operation where we currently expect to continue development activities and/or extend the lease terms.

OTHER BUSINESS MATTERS 

Title to Properties 

We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. Individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other outstanding interests customary in the industry. In addition, interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments, ordinary course liens incidental to operating agreements and for current taxes or development obligations under oil and gas leases. As is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties, preliminary investigations of record title are made at the time of lease acquisition. Complete investigations are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. 

Competition 

The oil and gas industry is highly competitive and we experience strong competition in our primary producing areas. We primarily compete with integrated, independent and other energy companies for the sale and transportation of our oil and natural gas production to marketing companies and end users. Furthermore, the oil and gas industry competes with other energy industries that supply fuel and power to industrial, commercial and residential consumers. Many of these competitors have greater financial, technical and personnel resources. The effect of these competitive factors cannot be predicted. 

Price, contract terms, availability of rigs and related equipment and quality of service, including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition. We believe that our extensive acreage position and our access to gathering and pipeline infrastructure in Pennsylvania, along with our expected activity level and the related services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years, enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or services in place. 

Major Customers 

During the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , two &#32;customers accounted for approximately 16% &#32;and 14% , two customers accounted for approximately 14% and 10% and four customers accounted for approximately 21%, 16%, 14% and 11%, respectively, of our total sales. We do not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on us because alternative customers are readily available. 

Seasonality 

Demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal, with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months. 

Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Exploration and Production 

Exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. This regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells, maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled, and the plugging and abandoning of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells, and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill. Because these statutes, rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended, expanded and reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and, consequently, affects its profitability. We do not believe, however, we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry. 

Natural Gas Marketing, Gathering and Transportation 

Federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed. Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA), and the regulations promulgated under those statutes, the FERC regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from FERC jurisdiction. Effective beginning in January 1993, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act deregulated natural gas prices for all &#8220;first sales&#8221; of natural gas, which definition covers all sales of our own production. In addition, as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below, the FERC granted to all producers such as us a &#8220;blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity&#8221; authorizing the sale of natural gas for resale without further FERC approvals. As a result of this policy, all of our produced natural gas is sold at market prices, subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect. In addition, under the provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (2005 Act), the NGA was amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas. Pursuant to the 2005 Act, the FERC established regulations intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency by, among other things, requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the FERC. The 2005 Act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the NGA and the FERC&#8217;s regulations up to $1,000,000 per day per violation. In 2010, the FERC issued Penalty Guidelines for the determination of civil penalties and procedure under its enforcement program. 

Some of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC. We own an intrastate natural gas pipeline through our wholly&#8209;owned subsidiary, Cranberry Pipeline Corporation, that provides interstate transportation and storage services pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA, as well as intrastate transportation and storage services that are regulated by the West Virginia Public Service Commission. For qualified intrastate pipelines, FERC allows interstate transportation service &#8220;on behalf of&#8221; interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting the intrastate pipeline to the more comprehensive NGA jurisdiction of the FERC. We provide Section 311 service in accordance with a publicly available Statement of Operating Conditions filed with FERC under rates that are subject to approval by the FERC. On December 18, 2012, we filed with the FERC a petition for rate approval of our existing interstate transportation rates and a proposed decrease of our storage rates. By Letter Order issued May 15, 2013, the FERC approved the rate petition. 

In 2012 we executed a precedent agreement with Constitution, at the time a wholly owned subsidiary of Williams Partners L.P., for 500,000 Dth per day of pipeline capacity and acquired a 25% equity interest in a pipeline to be constructed in the states of New York and Pennsylvania. On June 12, 2013, the project sponsors filed an application with FERC requesting a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct and operate the 124&#8209;mile pipeline project that, once completed, will provide 650,000 Dth per day of pipeline capacity. On December 2, 2014, the FERC issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity, authorizing the construction and operation of the pipeline project. While FERC has issued the certificate, the project scope or timeline for construction and eventual in-service date may still be impacted by the public regulatory permitting process. When placed into service, the project pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by FERC under the NGA. 

Additionally, in 2014 we executed a precedent agreement with Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco) for 850,000 Dth per day of pipeline capacity and acquired a 20% &#32;equity interest in Meade, which was formed to construct a pipeline with Transco from Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania to an interconnect with Transco's mainline in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The proposed pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by the FERC under the NGA. Transco filed an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity with the FERC on March 31, 2015 and is currently seeking various federal and state approvals authorizing construction and operation of the pipeline. 

Our production and gathering facilities are not subject to jurisdiction of the FERC; however, our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the cost of transporting the natural gas once sold to the consuming market is a factor in the prices we receive. Beginning with Order No. 436 in 1985 and continuing through Order No. 636 in 1992 and Order No. 637 in 2000, the FERC has adopted a series of rulemakings that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas. These changes were intended by the FERC to foster competition by, among other things, requiring interstate pipeline companies to separate their wholesale gas marketing business from their gas transportation business, and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services. The FERC has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates, which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other, and that certain information not be shared. The FERC has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis. 

In light of these statutory and regulatory changes, most pipelines have divested their natural gas sales functions to marketing affiliates, which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants. Most pipelines have also implemented the large&#8209;scale divestiture of their natural gas gathering facilities to affiliated or non&#8209;affiliated companies. Interstate pipelines are required to provide unbundled, open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportation&#8209;related services to producers, gas marketing companies, local distribution companies, industrial end users and other customers seeking such services. As a result of FERC requiring natural gas pipeline companies to separate marketing and transportation services, sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to pipeline transportation services, and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties. We believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while, at the same time, substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace. We cannot predict what new or different regulations the FERC and other regulatory agencies may adopt, or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities. Similarly, we cannot predict what proposals, if any, that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, such proposals might have on us. Further, we cannot predict whether the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry will continue or what effect future policies will have on our sale of gas. 

Federal Regulation of Swap Transactions 

We use derivative financial instruments such as collar and swap agreements to attempt to more effectively manage price risk due to the impact of changes in commodity prices on our operating results and cash flows. Following enactment of the Dodd&#8209;Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd&#8209;Frank Act) in July 2010, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions, 

including certain options. The CFTC regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties. In addition, all swap market participants are subject to new reporting and recordkeeping requirements related to their swap transactions. We believe that our use of swaps to hedge against commodity exposure qualifies us as an end&#8209;user, exempting us from the requirement to centrally clear our swaps. Nevertheless, the changes to the swap market as a result of Dodd&#8209;Frank implementation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps, materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions and/or reduce the availability of new or existing swaps. If we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the Dodd&#8209;Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable. 

Federal Regulation of Petroleum 

Our sales of crude oil and NGLs are not regulated and are made at market prices. However, the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. Much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines, which are regulated by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA). FERC requires that pipelines regulated under the ICA file tariffs setting forth the rates and terms and conditions of service and that such service not be unduly discriminatory or preferential. 

Effective January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. These regulations may increase or decrease the cost of transporting crude oil and NGLs by interstate pipeline, although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year. Every five years, the FERC must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry. In December 2015, to implement this required five&#8209;year re&#8209;determination, the FERC established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods plus 1.23% should be the oil pricing index for the five&#8209;year period beginning July 1, 2016. The result of indexing is a &#8220;ceiling rate&#8221; for each rate, which is the maximum at which the pipeline may set its interstate transportation rates. A pipeline may also file cost&#8209;of&#8209;service based rates if rate indexing will be insufficient to allow the pipeline to recover its costs. Rates are subject to challenge by protest when they are filed or changed. For indexed rates, complaints alleging that the rates are unjust and unreasonable may only be pursued if the complainant can show that a substantial change has occurred since the enactment of Energy Policy Act of 1992 in either the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services provided, that were a basis for the rate. There is no such limitation on complaints alleging that the pipeline&#8217;s rates or terms and conditions of service are unduly discriminatory or preferential. We are unable to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the FERC of the pipeline index. 

Pipeline Safety Regulation 

Certain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in West Virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the West Virginia Public Service Commission. In 2002, Congress enacted the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (2002 Act), which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety. The DOT&#8217;s final regulations implementing the act became effective February 2004. Among other provisions, the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission and non&#8209;rural gathering pipeline facilities in certain locations within ten years, and at least every seven years thereafter. On March 15, 2006, the DOT revised these regulations to define more clearly the categories of gathering facilities subject to DOT regulation, establish new safety rules for certain gathering lines in rural areas, revise the current regulations applicable to safety and inspection of gathering lines in non&#8209;rural areas, and adopt new compliance deadlines. The initial baseline assessments under our integrity management program for our pipeline system in West Virginia were completed in January 2013. Pipeline integrity was confirmed at each of the targeted assessment sites. A new seven&#8209;year reassessment cycle began during 2013. 

In December 2006, Congress enacted the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 (PIPES Act), which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 Act, proposed enhancements for state programs to reduce excavation damage to pipelines, established increased federal enforcement of one&#8209;call excavation programs, and established a new program for review of pipeline security plans and critical facility inspections. Pursuant to the PIPES Act, the DOT issued regulations on May 5, 2011 that would, with limited exceptions, subject all low&#8209;stress hazardous liquids pipelines, regardless of location or size, to the DOT&#8217;s pipeline safety regulations. 

In December 2011, Congress passed the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011. The act increased the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions; required the DOT to issue regulations requiring the use of automatic or remote&#8209;controlled shutoff valves on new and rebuilt pipelines and to study and 

report on the expansion of integrity management requirements, the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety, and the use of leak detection systems by hazardous liquid pipelines; required pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure; and imposed new emergency response and incident notification requirements. The act reflects many of the areas of possible regulatory change described in an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued by the DOT on August 18, 2011, including revisions to DOT's civil penalty authority and the requirement that pipelines verify maximum allowable operating pressure. 

On December 3, 2009, the DOT adopted a regulation requiring gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that use supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and have at least one controller and control room to develop written control room management procedures by August 1, 2011 and implement the procedures by February 1, 2013. The DOT expedited the program implementation deadline to October 1, 2011 for most of the requirements, except for certain provisions regarding adequate information and alarm management, which had a program implementation deadline of August 1, 2012. We developed and implemented the required control room management procedures in accordance with the deadlines. Effective January 1, 2011, natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines also became subject to updated reporting requirements with DOT. 

The cost of compliance with DOT&#8217;s integrity management rules depends on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing. Changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management, whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas can have a significant impact on costs we may incur to ensure compliance. On October 1, 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) that specifies anomaly and repair timeframes, which currently are left entirely to the operator&#8217;s discretion. The NOPR proposes to require that certain repairs be made immediately. Specifically, dents located on the bottom of the pipeline that have any indication of metal loss, cracking or a stress riser, as well as situations in which the pipeline&#8217;s calculated burst pressure is less than 1.1 times the maximum operating pressure at the location of an anomaly would both be categorized as immediate repair conditions. The NOPR also proposes to include a general requirement for performing all other repairs within a reasonable time. 

In the future other laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted or existing laws may be reinterpreted in a manner that could impact our compliance costs. In addition, we may be subject to DOT&#8217;s enforcement actions and penalties for failure to comply with pipeline regulations. 

Environmental and Safety Regulations 

General. &#32;&#32;Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. Permits are required for the operation of our various facilities. These permits can be revoked, modified or renewed by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines, injunctions or both. Government regulations can increase the cost of planning, designing, installing and operating, and can affect the timing of installing and operating, oil and natural gas facilities. Although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us, risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and natural gas production operations. No assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred. Also, it is possible that other developments, such as stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and natural gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us. 

U.S. laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. 

Solid and Hazardous Waste. &#32;&#32;We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and natural gas for many years. Although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized, it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us. State and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become stricter over time. Under these increasingly stringent requirements, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators) or clean up property contamination (including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators) or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination. 

We generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and comparable state statutes. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes. It is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be 

designated as hazardous wastes under RCRA or other applicable statutes. We could, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today. 

Superfund. &#32;&#32;The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as the &#8220;Superfund&#8221; law, and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include the current and past owners and operators of a site where the release occurred and any party that treated or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA, and in some cases, private parties, to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances, or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. In the course of business, we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within CERCLA&#8217;s definition of hazardous substances. We may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released. As a result, we may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been released. 

Oil Pollution Act. &#32;&#32;The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the United States. The term &#8220;waters of the United States&#8221; has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies, including wetlands and intermittent streams. The OPA assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. The OPA also imposes ongoing requirements on operators, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill. We believe that we substantially comply with the Oil Pollution Act and related federal regulations. 

Endangered Species Act. &#32;&#32;The Endangered Species Act (ESA) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. While some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA, nor are we aware of any proposed listings that will affect our operations. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected states. 

Clean Water Act. &#32;&#32;The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act) and resulting regulations, which are primarily implemented through a system of permits, also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the United States. Sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the Clean Water Act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies. However, regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges. We believe that we substantially comply with the Clean Water Act and related federal and state regulations. 

Clean Air Act. &#32;&#32;Our operations are subject to the Federal Clean Air Act and comparable local and state laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution. Federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction. Major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent, federally imposed requirements including additional permits. Federal and state laws designed to control toxic air pollutants and greenhouse gases might require installation of additional controls. Payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits. Regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources. We believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local, state, and federal laws and regulations. 

Some of our producing wells and associated facilities are subject to restrictive air emission limitations and permitting requirements. In 2012, the EPA published final New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) that amended the existing NSPS and NESHAP standards for oil and gas facilities and created new NSPS standards for oil and natural gas production, transmission and distribution facilities with a compliance deadline of January 1, 2015. While these rules remain in effect, the EPA announced in 2013 that it would reexamine and reissue the rules over the next three years. The EPA has issued updated rules regarding storage tanks and additional rules are expected. In December 2014, the EPA issued additional amendments to these rules that, among other things, distinguished between multiple flowback stages during completion of hydraulically fractured wells and clarified that storage tanks permanently removed from service are not affected by any requirements. In July 2015, the EPA finalized two further updates to these rules addressing the definition of low pressure gas wells and references to tanks that are connected to one another (referred to as 

connected in parallel). In September 2015, the EPA issued a proposed rule that would update and expand the NSPS by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry. The EPA also issued a proposed rule in September 2015 concerning aggregation of sources that would affect source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry. If we are unable to comply with air pollution regulations or to obtain permits for emissions associated with our operations, we could be required to forego construction, modification or certain operations. These regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate, and result in administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance. Obtaining permits may delay the development of our oil and natural gas projects, including the construction and operation of facilities. 

Safe Drinking Water Act. &#32;&#32;The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and comparable local and state provisions restrict the disposal, treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development. Subsurface emplacement of fluids (including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery) is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that, in some cases, includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the state&#8217;s environmental authority. These regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities. 

Hydraulic Fracturing. &#32;&#32;Many of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and natural gas wells. This technology involves the injection of fluids, usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives, as well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the formation that allow oil or natural gas to flow more freely to the wellbore. Most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well. Due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal, state and local levels have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether. Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities, including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and increased compliance costs, which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. For additional information about hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters, please read &#8220;Risk Factors-Federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development, including hydraulic fracturing, could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays&#8221; in Item 1A. 

Greenhouse Gas. &#32;&#32;In response to studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to global climate change, the United States Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the United States between 2012 and 2050. In addition, many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. The EPA has also begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. This includes proposed regulation of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. If we are unable to recover or pass through a significant portion of our costs related to complying with current and future regulations relating to climate change and GHGs, it could materially affect our operations and financial condition. To the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of, and access to, capital. Future legislation or regulations adopted to address climate change could also make our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. Please read &#8220;Risk Factors-Climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce&#8221; in Item 1A.
