 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

The Western Union Company (the "Company," "Western Union," "we," "our" or "us") is a leader in global money movement and payment services, providing people and businesses with fast, reliable and convenient ways to send money and make payments around the world. The Company was incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Data Corporation ("First Data") on February 17, 2006, and on September 29, 2006, First Data distributed all of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses and its interest in a Western Union money transfer agent, as well as its related assets, including real estate, through a tax-free distribution to First Data shareholders (the "Spin-off"). 

The Western Union &#174; &#32;brand is globally recognized and represents speed, reliability, trust and convenience. As people move and travel around the world, they are able to use the services of a well-recognized brand to transfer funds. Our Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer service enables people to send money around the world, usually within minutes. As of December 31, 2015 , our services were available through a global network of over 500,000 &#32;agent locations in more than 200 countries and territories , with approximately 90% &#32;of those locations outside of the United States. Each location in our agent network is capable of providing one or more of our services, with the majority offering a Western Union branded service. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 70% of our locations had experienced money transfer activity in the previous 12 months. 

We also provide consumers with flexible and convenient options for making one-time or recurring payments in our Consumer-to-Business segment. This segment primarily consists of United States bill payments and Pago F&#225;cil-branded bill payments in Argentina. 

The Business Solutions segment facilitates payment and foreign exchange solutions, primarily cross-border, cross-currency transactions, for small and medium size enterprises and other organizations and individuals. The majority of the segment's business relates to exchanges of currency at spot rates, which enable customers to make cross-currency payments. In addition, in certain countries, we write foreign currency forward and option contracts for customers to facilitate future payments. 

&#160; 

We believe that brand strength, size and reach of our global network, convenience, reliability and value for the price paid for our customers have been important to the growth of our business. As we continue to seek to meet the needs of our customers for fast, reliable and convenient global money movement and payment services, we are also working to enhance our services and provide our consumer and business clients with access to an expanding portfolio of payment and other financial services and to expand the ways our services can be accessed. 

Our Segments 

We manage our business around the consumers and businesses we serve and the types of services we offer. Each of our three segments addresses a different combination of customer groups, distribution networks and services offered. Our segments are Consumer-to-Consumer, Consumer-to-Business and Business Solutions. Businesses not considered part of these segments are categorized as "Other" and include our money order and other services, in addition to costs for the review and closing of acquisitions.

No individual country outside the United States accounted for more than approximately 7% of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

For additional details regarding our Consumer-to-Consumer, Consumer-to-Business and Business Solutions segments, including financial information regarding our international and United States revenues and long-lived assets, see Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, &#32;Note 17, "Segments," in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a discussion of certain risks relating to our foreign operations. 

Consumer-to-Consumer Segment 

Individual money transfers from one consumer to another are the core of our business, representing 79% &#32;of our total consolidated revenues for 2015 . A substantial majority of these transfers were cross-border transactions. We view our money transfer service as one interconnected global network where a money transfer can be sent from one location to another, around the world. The segment includes five geographic regions whose functions are limited to generating, managing and maintaining agent relationships and localized marketing activities, and also includes our online money transfer service conducted through Western Union branded websites ("westernunion.com"). By means of common processes and systems, these regions and westernunion.com create an interconnected network for consumer transactions, thereby constituting one global Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer business and one operating segment. 

Although most remittances are sent from one of our agent locations worldwide, in some countries we offer the ability to initiate transactions from a Western Union branded website, including through mobile devices. All agent locations accept cash to initiate a transaction, and some also accept debit cards. We offer consumers several options to receive a money transfer. The vast majority of transfers are paid in cash at agent locations. 

Operations 

Our revenue in this segment is derived primarily from transaction fees charged to consumers to transfer money. In money transfers involving different send and receive currencies, we also generate revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the consumer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire the currency. 

In a typical money transfer transaction, a consumer goes to one of our agent locations, completes a form specifying, among other things, the name and other identifying information regarding the recipient, and delivers it, along with the principal amount of the money transfer and the fee, to the agent. Certain of these processes are streamlined for our consumers who participate in our loyalty programs. The sending agent enters the transaction information into our money transfer system and the funds are made available for payment, usually within minutes. In some jurisdictions, the agent collects the principal and fees after the presentation of a written disclosure that generally identifies the exchange rate and all fees and charges associated with the transaction and the consumer has agreed to the transaction, as described in the disclosure. The recipient generally enters an agent location in the designated receiving area or country, presents identification, where applicable, and is paid the transferred amount. Recipients generally do not pay a fee. However, in limited circumstances, a tax may be imposed by the local government on the receipt of the money transfer, or a fee may be charged by the receiver's institution related to the use of an account. We determine the fee paid by the sender, which generally is based on the principal amount of the transaction and the send and receive locations. 

We generally pay our agents a commission based on a percentage of revenue. A commission is usually paid to both the agent that initiated the transaction, the "send agent," and the agent that paid the transaction, the "receive agent." For most agents, the costs of providing the physical infrastructure and staff are typically covered by the agent's primary business (e.g., postal services, banking, check cashing, travel and retail businesses), making the economics of being a Western Union agent attractive. Western Union's global reach and large consumer base allow us to attract agents we believe to be of high quality. 

To complement the convenience offered by our network's global physical locations, in certain countries we have also made our services available through other channels, as described below under "Services." 

No individual country outside the United States accounted for greater than 7% of this segment's revenue during all periods presented. 

Services 

We offer money transfer services in more than 200 countries and territories with a number of options for sending funds that provide consumers convenience and choice, through both our walk-in and online money transfer channels. 

&#8226; 

Walk-in money transfer. The substantial majority of our remittances constitute walk-in transactions in which payment is collected by one of our agents and is available for pick-up at another agent location, usually within minutes. Additionally, in a few select markets, we offer consumers a lower-priced next day delivery service option for money transfers that do not need to be received within minutes. 

&#8226; 

Online money transfer. In certain countries, consumers can initiate a money transfer from a Western Union branded website, including through their mobile devices. As of December 31, 2015 , we were providing online money transfer services through Western Union branded websites in 34 countries. Additionally, in certain countries, consumers can initiate a Western Union money transfer through their bank&#8217;s online banking services. 

Our consumers can fund a transaction in a variety of ways, in addition to cash. For example, at certain of our agent locations, consumers can fund a transaction using a debit card, and, where available, consumers can fund a money transfer from an account through an automated teller machine ("ATM"). In our online money transfer channel, consumers can generally fund transactions using a credit card, debit card, electronic funds transfer processed through the automated clearing house ("ACH") payment system, or other bank account-based payment. 

We also provide several options for the receipt of funds. At our retail agent locations, consumers generally receive payments in cash. However, in certain countries, our retail agents may also issue a money order or check or provide payout through an ATM. Funds can also be directed to a bank account in a number of countries, by either the sender or receiver, and in more limited circumstances, can be directed to either a mobile wallet or a stored-value card. 

Distribution and Marketing Channels 

We offer our Consumer-to-Consumer service to consumers around the world primarily through our global network of third-party agents in most countries and territories, with approximately 90% &#32;of our agent locations being located outside of the United States. Our agents facilitate the global distribution and convenience associated with our brands, which in turn helps create demand for our services and helps us to recruit and retain agents. Western Union agents include large networks such as post offices, banks and retailers, and other established organizations and smaller independent retail locations that provide other consumer products and services. Many of our agents have multiple locations. Our agents know the markets they serve and work with our management to develop business plans for their markets. In some regions, our agents contribute financial resources to, or otherwise support, our efforts to market the business. Many agents operate in locations that are open outside of traditional banking hours, for example on nights and weekends. Our top 40 agents globally have been with us an average of approximately 20 years and in 2015 , these long-standing agents were involved in transactions that generated approximately 60% of our Consumer-to-Consumer revenue. No individual agent accounted for greater than 10% of the segment's revenue during all periods presented. 

We provide our third-party agents with access to our multi-currency, real-time money transfer processing systems used to originate and pay money transfers. Our systems and processes enable our agents to pay money transfers in more than 130 currencies worldwide. Certain of our agents can pay in multiple currencies at a single location. Our agents provide the physical infrastructure and staff required to complete the transfers. Western Union provides central operating functions such as transaction processing, settlement, marketing support and consumer relationship management to our agents, as well as compliance training and related support. Some of our agents outside the United States manage subagents. We refer to these agents as superagents. Although the subagents are under contract with these superagents (and not with Western Union directly), the subagent locations typically have access to similar technology and services as our other agent locations. Our international agents often customize services as appropriate for their geographic markets. In some markets, individual agents are independently offering specific services such as stored-value card payout options or Direct to Bank service. While we typically perform services under the Western Union brand, &#32; in certain geographic regions, we operate under other brands targeted to the local market. 

We market our services to consumers in a number of ways, directly and indirectly through our agent partners, leveraging promotional activities, grassroots and digital advertising, and loyalty programs. Our marketing strategy includes our consumer programs, such as "My WU SM " and "Gold Card," which are available in many countries and territories. These programs offer consumers faster service at the point-of-sale. Additionally, in certain countries and at westernunion.com, consumers can earn points that can be redeemed for rewards, such as reduced transaction fees or cash back; however, such redemption activity has been insignificant to the results of our operations. 

Industry Trends 

Trends in the cross-border money transfer business tend to correlate to migration trends, global economic opportunity and related employment levels worldwide. Another significant trend impacting the money transfer industry is increasing regulation. Regulations in the United States and elsewhere focus, in part, on anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing and consumer protection. Regulations require money transfer providers, banks and other financial institutions to develop systems to prevent, detect, monitor and report certain transactions. Such regulations increase the costs to provide money transfer services and can make it more difficult or less desirable for consumers and others to use money transfer services, either of which could have an adverse effect on money transfer providers' revenues and operating profits. For further discussion of the regulatory impact on our business, see the "Regulation" discussion in this section, Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and the "Enhanced Regulatory Compliance" section in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . Additionally, our ability to enter into or maintain exclusive arrangements with our agents has been and may continue to be challenged by both regulators and certain of our current and prospective agents. Further, we are seeing increased competition from, and increased market acceptance of, electronic, mobile, and Internet-based money transfer services as well as digital currencies. 

Competition 

We face robust competition in the highly-fragmented Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer industry. We compete with a variety of remittance providers, including: 

&#8226; 

Global money transfer providers - &#32; Global money transfer providers allow consumers to send money to a wide variety of locations, in both their home countries and abroad. 

&#8226; 

Regional money transfer providers - Regional money transfer providers, or "niche" providers, provide the same services as global money transfer providers, but focus on a smaller group of geographic corridors or services within one region, such as North America to the Caribbean, Central or South America, or Western Europe to North Africa. 

&#8226; 

Electronic channels - Online money transfer service providers, including certain electronic payment providers, allow consumers to send and receive money electronically using the Internet or through mobile devices. Electronic channels also include digital wallets, digital currencies, and social media and other predominantly communication or commerce oriented platforms that offer money transfer services. 

&#8226; 

Banks, postbanks, and post offices - Banks, postbanks, and post offices of all sizes compete with us in a number of ways, including bank wire services, payment instrument issuances, and card-based services. 

&#8226; 

Informal networks - Informal networks enable people to transfer funds without formal mechanisms and often without compliance with government reporting requirements. We believe that such networks comprise a significant share of the market. 

&#8226; 

Alternative channels - Alternative channels for sending and receiving money include mail and commercial courier services, and card-based options, such as ATM cards and stored-value cards. 

We believe the most significant competitive factors in Consumer-to-Consumer remittances relate to the overall consumer value proposition, including brand recognition, trust, reliability, consumer experience, price, speed of delivery, distribution network, variety of payment methods, and channel options. 

Consumer-to-Business Segment 

In our Consumer-to-Business segment, which represented 12% &#32;of our total consolidated revenues for 2015 , we provide fast and convenient options to make one-time or recurring payments from consumers to businesses and other organizations, including utilities, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers, government agencies and other businesses. We believe our business customers who receive payments through our services benefit from their relationship with Western Union as it provides them with real-time or near real-time posting of their customers' payments. In many circumstances, our relationships with business customers also provide them with an additional source of income, as well as reduced expenses for cash and check handling. 

Operations 

Our revenue in this segment is derived primarily from transaction fees paid by the consumer. The transaction fees are typically less than the fees charged in our Consumer-to-Consumer segment. Consumers may make a cash payment at an agent or Company-owned location or may make an electronic payment on the Internet or over the phone using their credit or debit card, or through ACH. Our Internet services are provided through our own websites or in partnership with other websites for which we act as the service provider. The significant majority of the segment's revenue was generated in the United States during all periods presented, with the remainder primarily generated in Argentina. 

Services 

Our Consumer-to-Business payments services are available through a variety of options that give consumers choices as to the payment channel and method of payment, and include the following: 

Speedpay &#174; . Our Speedpay service is offered principally in the United States and allows consumers to make payments to a variety of businesses using credit cards, debit cards, ACH and in limited situations, checks. Payments are initiated through the Internet or over the phone. We also partner with some businesses to allow their customers to access Speedpay from their websites. 

Pago F&#225;cil &#174; . In South America, we offer walk-in, cash bill payment services which allow consumers to make payments for services such as phone, utilities and other recurring bills. In Argentina, we provide this service under the Pago F&#225;cil brand, which constitutes the vast majority of our services in South America. We offer this service under the Western Union brand in Peru and Panama. 

Western Union Payments. The Western Union Payments service, which includes our Quick Collect &#174; &#32;service, allows consumers to send funds to businesses and government agencies, primarily across the United States and Canada, using cash and, in certain locations, a debit card. This service is offered primarily at Western Union agent locations, but is provided via our westernunion.com website in limited situations. This service is also offered in select international locations under the service mark Quick Pay SM . We also offer Quick Cash &#174; , a cash disbursement service used by businesses, government agencies, and financial institutions primarily to send money to employees or individuals with whom they have accounts or other business relationships. Consumers also use our Western Union Convenience Pay &#174; &#32;("Convenience Pay") service to send payments by cash or check from a smaller number of Convenience Pay agent locations primarily to utilities and telecommunication providers. 

Distribution and Marketing Channels 

Our electronic consumer payment services are available primarily through the phone and Internet, including through certain mobile devices, while our cash-based consumer services are available through our agent networks and at select Company-owned locations that are primarily in South America. 

Businesses market our services to consumers in a number of ways, and we market our services directly to consumers using a variety of means, including advertising materials, promotional activities, call campaigns and attendance at trade shows and seminars. Our Internet services are marketed to consumers on our websites, on the websites of our partners who offer our payment solutions or through co-branding arrangements with these partners. 

Consumers can make payments to over 15,000 businesses through our Consumer-to-Business services. These relationships are a core component of our payments services. No individual consumer or business accounted for greater than 10% of this segment's revenue during all periods presented. 

Industry Trends 

The payments industry has evolved with technological innovations that have created new methods of processing payments from consumers to businesses. The various services within the payments industry are in varying stages of development outside the United States. We believe that the United States is moving toward electronic payment methods through the use of multiple technologies and away from cash and paper checks for bill payments. 

Competition 

Western Union competes with a diverse set of service providers offering both cash and electronic-based payment solutions. Competition in electronic payment services includes financial institutions (which may offer consumer bill payment in their own name or may "host" payment services operated under the names of their clients) and other non-bank competitors. Competition for electronic payments also includes businesses offering their own or third-party services to their own customers and third-party providers of all sizes offering services directly to consumers. Competitors for cash payments include businesses that allow consumers to pay a bill at one of their locations, or at the location of a partner business, as well as mail and courier services. The ongoing trend away from cash-based bill payments in the United States and competitive pressures, which result in lower cash-based bill payment volumes and a shift to lower revenue per transaction services, continues to impact this business. 

We believe the most significant competitive factors in this segment relate to customer service, trust and reliability, convenience, speed, price, variety of payment methods, biller relationships and service offerings, innovation, technology, and brand recognition. 

Business Solutions Segment 

In our Business Solutions segment, which represented 7% &#32;of our total consolidated revenues for 2015, we facilitate payment and foreign exchange solutions, primarily cross-border, cross-currency transactions, for small and medium size enterprises and other organizations and individuals. 

Operations 

The substantial majority of our revenue in this segment is derived from foreign exchange revenues, which are based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we are able to acquire the currency. Customers may make an electronic or wire transfer or remit a check in order to initiate a transaction. Our Internet services are provided through our own websites and also in partnership with others. The significant majority of the segment's revenue was generated outside the United States during all periods presented. 

Services 

Business Solutions payment transactions are conducted through various channels including the phone and Internet. Payments are made predominately through electronic transfers, but in some situations, checks are remitted. The majority of Business Solutions' business relates to exchanges of currency at spot rates, which enable customers to make cross-currency payments. For certain payment services such as for law firms and educational institution payments, we provide tailored payment solutions. In addition, in certain countries, we write foreign currency forward and option contracts for customers to facilitate future payments, which usually generate higher revenue per transaction than spot payments. 

Distribution and Marketing Channels 

Our Business Solutions services are primarily offered over the phone, through partner channels, and via the Internet. Our Internet services are marketed through co-branding arrangements with our website partners as well as on our own websites. 

We have relationships with more than 100,000 customers with respect to our payment solutions. These relationships are a core component of our business payments services. No individual customer accounted for greater than 10% of this segment's revenue. 

Industry Trends 

The business-to-business payments industry has evolved with technological innovations that have created new methods of processing payments from businesses to other businesses. The various products and services within the business-to-business payments industry are in varying stages of development. We believe that the cross-border payments industry will expand in the future due to the expanding global focus of many businesses. Increased regulation and compliance requirements are trends also impacting the business-to-business payments industry, which will likely result in increased costs in this segment. 

Competition 

Western Union competes with a diverse set of service providers offering payment services and foreign exchange risk management solutions, including financial institutions and other non-bank competitors. We believe the most significant competitive factors in this segment relate to recurring relationships founded on customer service and expertise in payments and foreign exchange, customized solutions for specific industries and clients, convenience and speed of payments network, availability of derivative products, variety of inbound and outbound payment methods, brand recognition and price. 

Other 

Our remaining businesses, including our money order services, are grouped in the "Other" category, which also includes costs for the review and closing of acquisitions. 

Consumers use our money orders for making purchases, paying bills, and as an alternative to checks. We derive investment income from interest generated on our money order settlement assets, which are primarily held in United States tax exempt state and municipal debt securities. 

Intellectual Property 

The Western Union logos, trademarks, service marks and trade dress are registered and/or used worldwide and are material to our Company. The WU &#174; &#32;service mark and logos are also registered and used in many countries around the world. We offer money transfer services under the Western Union, Orlandi Valuta SM &#32;and Vigo &#174; &#32;brands. We also provide various payment and other services such as Western Union Payments, Quick Collect, Convenience Pay, Quick Pay, Quick Cash, Speedpay, Pago F&#225;cil (registered in Argentina), and Western Union Business Solutions. 

Our operating results over the past several years have allowed us to invest significantly each year to support our brands. In 2015 , we invested approximately $210 million to market, advertise and promote our brands and services, including costs of dedicated marketing personnel. In some regions, our agents have also contributed financial resources to assist with marketing our services. 

Risk Management 

Our Company has a credit risk management department that evaluates and monitors our credit and fraud risks. We are exposed to credit risk related to receivable balances from agents in the money transfer, walk-in bill payment and money order settlement process. We also are exposed to credit risk directly from consumer transactions particularly through our electronic channels, which include our westernunion.com, account based money transfer and mobile money transfer services, where transactions are originated through means other than cash, and therefore are subject to "chargebacks," insufficient funds, or other collection impediments, such as fraud, which are anticipated to increase as electronic channels become a greater proportion of our money transfer business. Our credit risk management team monitors fraud risks jointly with our information security and global compliance departments, performs credit reviews before each agent signing, and conducts periodic analyses of agents and certain other parties we transact with directly. 

We are exposed to credit risk in our Business Solutions business relating to: (a) derivatives written by us to our customers and (b) the extension of trade credit when transactions are paid to recipients prior to our receiving cleared funds from the sending customers. For the derivatives, the duration of these contracts at inception is generally less than one year. The credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers, possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us. For those receivables where we have offered trade credit, collection ordinarily occurs within a few days. To mitigate risk associated with potential customer defaults, we perform credit reviews on an ongoing basis, and, for our derivatives, we may require certain customers to post or increase collateral. 

To manage our exposures to credit risk with respect to investment securities, money market fund investments, derivatives and other credit risk exposures resulting from our relationships with banks and financial institutions, we regularly review investment concentrations, trading levels, credit spreads and credit ratings, and we attempt to diversify our investments among global financial institutions. 

A key component of the Western Union business model is our ability to manage financial risk associated with conducting transactions worldwide. We settle with the majority of our agents in United States dollars or euros. However, in certain circumstances, we settle in other currencies. We typically require the agent to obtain local currency to pay recipients; thus, we generally are not reliant on international currency markets to obtain and pay illiquid currencies. The foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that the majority of money transfer transactions are paid by the next day after they are initiated and agent settlements occur within a few days in most instances. We also utilize foreign currency exchange contracts, primarily forward contracts, to mitigate the risks associated with currency fluctuations and to provide predictability of future cash flows. We have additional foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk management due to the nature of our Business Solutions business. The majority of this business' revenue is from exchanges of currency at spot rates, which enable customers to make cross-currency payments. Business Solutions aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts, including the derivative contracts described above, and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties. 

Our financial results may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. We review our overall exposure to floating and fixed rates by evaluating our net asset or liability position in each, also considering the duration of the individual positions. We manage this mix of fixed versus floating exposure in an attempt to minimize risk, reduce costs and improve returns. Our exposure to interest rates can be modified by changing the mix of our interest-bearing assets as well as adjusting the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt. The latter is accomplished primarily through the use of interest rate swaps and the decision regarding terms of any new debt issuances (i.e., fixed versus floating). We use interest rate swaps designated as hedges to increase the percentage of floating rate debt, subject to market conditions. 

International Investment 

No provision has been made for United States federal and state income taxes on certain of our outside tax basis differences, which primarily relate to accumulated foreign earnings of approximately $6.1 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 , as we have reinvested and expect to continue to reinvest these earnings outside the United States indefinitely. Over the last several years, such earnings have been used to pay for our international acquisitions and operations and provide initial Company funding of global principal payouts for Consumer-to-Consumer and Business Solutions transactions. However, if we are unable to utilize accumulated earnings outside of the United States and we repatriate these earnings to the United States in the form of actual or constructive dividends, we would be subject to significant United States federal income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes and possible withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. 

Regulation 

Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations enacted by the United States federal government, each of the states, many localities and many other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union. These include an increasingly strict set of legal and regulatory requirements intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, and other illicit activity. These also include laws and regulations regarding financial services, consumer disclosure and consumer protection, currency controls, money transfer and payment instrument licensing, payment services, credit and debit cards, electronic payments, foreign exchange hedging services and the sale of spot, forward and option currency contracts, unclaimed property, the regulation of competition, consumer privacy, data protection and information security. Failure by Western Union, our agents, or their subagents (agents and subagents are third parties, over whom Western Union has limited legal and practical control), and certain of our service providers to comply with any of these requirements or their interpretation could result in the suspension or revocation of a license or registration required to provide money transfer services and/or payment services or foreign exchange products, the limitation, suspension or termination of services, changes to our business model, loss of consumer confidence, private class action litigation, the seizure of our assets, and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines and restrictions on our ability to offer services. 

We have developed and continue to enhance our global compliance programs, including our anti-money laundering program comprised of policies, procedures, systems and internal controls to monitor and to address various legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, we continue to adapt our business practices and strategies to help us comply with current and evolving legal standards and industry practices, including heightened regulatory focus on compliance with anti-money laundering or fraud prevention requirements. As of December 31, 2015 , these programs included approximately 2,200 dedicated compliance personnel, training and monitoring programs, suspicious activity reporting, regulatory outreach and education, and support and guidance to our agent network on regulatory compliance. Our money transfer and payment service networks operate through third-party agents in most countries, and, therefore, there are limitations on our legal and practical ability to completely control those agents' compliance activities. In 2015 , we spent approximately $200 million on our compliance and regulatory programs. 

Money Transfer and Payment Instrument Licensing and Regulation 

Most of our services are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act in the United States, as amended (collectively, the "BSA"), and similar laws and regulations. The BSA, among other things, requires money transfer companies and the issuers and sellers of money orders to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, to report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and in some cases, to collect and maintain information about consumers who use their services and maintain other transaction records. In addition to United States federal laws and regulations, many other countries and states impose similar and, in some cases, more stringent requirements. These requirements also apply to our agents and their subagents. In addition, the United States Department of the Treasury has interpreted the BSA to require money transfer companies to conduct due diligence into and risk-based monitoring of their agents inside and outside the United States, and certain states also require money transfer companies to conduct due diligence reviews of their agents and subagents. Compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations continues to be a focus of regulatory attention, with recent agreements being reached with Western Union, other money transfer providers and several large financial institutions. 

Economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") and by certain foreign jurisdictions prohibit or restrict transactions to or from (or dealings with or involving) certain countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, as well as with certain individuals and entities such as narcotics traffickers, terrorists and terrorist organizations. We provide limited money transfer and payments services to individuals in Cuba, Syria and Sudan in accordance with United States laws authorizing such services and pursuant to and as authorized by advisory opinions of, or specific or general licenses issued by, OFAC. 

In the United States, almost all states license certain of our services and many exercise authority over the operations of certain aspects of our business and, as part of this authority, regularly examine us. Many states require us to invest the principal of outstanding money orders, money transfers, or payments in highly-rated, investment grade securities, and our use of such investments is restricted to satisfy outstanding settlement obligations. We regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by investing in highly-rated securities in compliance with these regulations. The substantial majority of our investment securities, classified within "Settlement assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are held in order to comply with state licensing requirements in the United States and are required to have credit ratings of "A-" or better from a major credit rating agency. 

These licensing laws also cover matters such as government approval of controlling shareholders and senior management of our licensed entities, regulatory approval of agents and in some instances their locations, consumer disclosures and the filing of periodic reports by the licensee, and require the licensee to demonstrate and maintain certain net worth levels. Many states also require money transfer providers and their agents to comply with federal and/or state anti-money laundering laws and regulations. 

Outside of the United States, our money transfer business is subject to some form of regulation in almost all of the countries and territories in which we offer those services. These laws and regulations may include limitations on what types of entities may offer money transfer services, agent registration requirements, limitations on the amount of principal that can be sent into or out of a country, limitations on the number of money transfers that may be sent or received by a consumer and controls on the rates of exchange between currencies. They also include laws and regulations intended to detect and prevent money laundering or terrorist financing, including obligations to collect and maintain information about consumers, recordkeeping, reporting and due diligence, and supervision of agents and subagents similar to and in some cases exceeding those required under the BSA. In most countries, either we or our agents are required to obtain licenses or to register with a government authority in order to offer money transfer services. 

The Payment Services Directive ("PSD") in the European Union ("EU") and similar laws in other jurisdictions have imposed rules on payment service providers like Western Union. In particular, Western Union is responsible for the regulatory compliance of our agents and their subagents who are engaged by one of our payments institution subsidiaries. Thus, the costs to monitor our agents and the risk of adverse regulatory action against us because of the actions of our agents in those areas have increased. The majority of our EU business is managed through our Irish payment institution subsidiary, which is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. Under the PSD and similar laws in certain other jurisdictions, we are subject to requirements such as investment safeguarding rules and periodic examinations similar to those we are subject to in the United States. These rules have resulted in increased compliance costs and may lead to increased competition in our areas of service. Additional countries may adopt legislation similar to these laws. The PSD, as well as legislation in other countries, has also allowed an increased number of non-bank entities to become money transfer agents, allowing Western Union and other money transfer providers to expand their agent networks in these countries but also resulting in increased competition. 

On February 11, 2010, Western Union Financial Services, Inc. ("WUFSI"), a subsidiary of the Company, signed a settlement agreement ("Southwest Border Agreement"), which resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State of Arizona and required us to fund a multi-state not-for-profit organization promoting safety and security along the United States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New Mexico are participating with Arizona. As part of the Southwest Border Agreement, we have made and expect to make certain investments in our compliance programs along the United States and Mexico border and a monitor (the "Monitor") has been engaged for those programs. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs in connection with the Southwest Border Agreement. The Monitor has made a number of recommendations related to our compliance programs, which we are implementing, including programs related to our Business Solutions segment. On January 31, 2014, the Southwest Border Agreement was amended to extend its term until December 31, 2017 (the "Amendment"). The Amendment imposes additional obligations on the Company and WUFSI in connection with WUFSI&#8217;s anti-money laundering compliance programs and cooperation with law enforcement. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors &#32;- " Western Union is the subject of governmental investigations and consent agreements with or enforcement actions by regulators " and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , Note 5, "Commitments and Contingencies," for more information on the Southwest Border Agreement, including the potential impact on our business. 

Regulators worldwide are exercising heightened supervision of money transfer providers and requiring increasing efforts to ensure compliance. As a result, we are experiencing increasing compliance costs related to customer, agent, and subagent due diligence, verification, transaction approval, disclosure, and reporting requirements, including requirements to report transaction data to a greater extent or frequency than previously required, along with other requirements that have had and will continue to have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Government agencies both inside and outside the United States may impose new or additional rules on money transfers affecting us or our agents or their subagents, including regulations that: 

&#8226; 

prohibit transactions in, to or from certain countries or with certain governments, individuals and entities; 

&#8226; 

impose additional customer identification and customer, agent, and subagent due diligence requirements; 

&#8226; 

impose additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements, or require enhanced transaction monitoring; 

&#8226; 

limit the types of entities capable of providing money transfer services, impose additional licensing or registration requirements on us, our agents, or their subagents, or impose additional requirements on us with regard to selection or oversight of our agents or their subagents; 

&#8226; 

impose minimum capital or other financial requirements on us or our agents and their subagents; 

&#8226; 

limit or restrict the revenue which may be generated from money transfers, including transaction fees and revenue derived from foreign exchange; 

&#8226; 

require enhanced disclosures to our money transfer customers; 

&#8226; 

require the principal amount of money transfers originated in a country to be invested in that country or held in trust until they are paid; 

&#8226; 

limit the number or principal amount of money transfers which may be sent to or from the jurisdiction, whether by an individual, through one agent or in aggregate; 

&#8226; 

impose taxes or fees on money transfer transactions; 

&#8226; 

restrict or limit our ability to process transactions using centralized databases, for example, by requiring that transactions be processed using a database maintained in a particular country; and 

&#8226; 

prohibit or limit exclusive arrangements with our agents and subagents. 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Other Similar Legislation 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") became United States federal law in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB") whose purpose is to implement, examine for compliance with and enforce federal consumer protection laws governing financial products and services, including money transfer services. The CFPB has created additional regulatory obligations for us and has the authority to examine and supervise us and our larger competitors, including for matters related to unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. The CFPB's regulations implementing the remittance provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have affected our business in a variety of areas. These include: a requirement to provide almost all consumers sending funds internationally from the United States enhanced, written, pre-transaction disclosures, including the disclosure of fees, foreign exchange rates and taxes, an obligation to resolve various errors, including certain errors that may be outside our control, and an obligation to cancel transactions that have not been completed at a consumer's request. We have modified certain of our systems, business practices, service offerings or procedures to comply with these regulations. We also face liability for the failure of our money transfer agents to comply with the rules and have implemented and are continuing to implement additional policies, procedures, and oversight measures designed to foster compliance by our agents. The extent of our, and our agents' implementation of these policies, procedures, and measures may be considered by the CFPB in any action or proceeding against us for noncompliance with the rules by our agents. The CFPB has also implemented a direct portal for gathering information regarding consumer complaints in the money transfer area. It is likely that this effort will lead to additional regulatory scrutiny. 

&#160; 

Rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as well as the provisions of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation and its technical standards, which are directly applicable in the member states of the European Union, have subjected most of our foreign exchange hedging transactions, including certain intercompany hedging transactions, certain of the corporate interest rate hedging transactions we may enter into in the future, and certain of the foreign exchange derivative contracts we offer as part of our Business Solutions segment, to reporting, recordkeeping, and other requirements. Additionally, certain of the corporate interest rate hedging transactions we may enter into in the future may be subject to centralized clearing and margin requirements and certain of our other transactions may become so in the future. Other jurisdictions outside of the United States and the European Union are considering, have implemented, or are implementing regulations similar to those described above. Derivatives regulations have added costs to our business and any additional requirements, such as future registration requirements and increased regulation of forward contracts, will result in additional costs or impact the way we conduct our hedging activities as well as impact how we conduct our business within our Business Solutions segment. For further discussion of these risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors &#32;- " The Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the regulations required by that Act and the actions of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and similar legislation and regulations enacted by other government authorities, could adversely affect us and the scope of our activities, and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows ." 

&#160; 

Unclaimed Property Regulations 

Our Company is subject to unclaimed property laws in the United States and in certain other countries. These laws require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others held by our Company that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time, such as unpaid money transfers and money orders. We hold property subject to unclaimed property laws and we have an ongoing program designed to help us comply with these laws. We are subject to audits with regard to our escheatment practices. 

Privacy Regulations and Information Security Standards 

We must collect, transfer, disclose, use and store personal information in order to provide our services. These activities are subject to information security standards, data privacy, data breach and related laws and regulations in the United States and other countries. In the United States, data privacy and data breach laws such as the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and various state laws apply directly to a broad range of financial institutions including money transfer providers like Western Union, and indirectly to companies that provide services to or on behalf of those institutions. The United States Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") has an on-going program of investigating the privacy practices of companies and has commenced enforcement actions against many, resulting in multimillion dollar settlements and multi-year agreements governing the settling companies' privacy practices. The FTC, CFPB, and several states have expanded their area of concern to include privacy practices related to online and mobile applications. Many state laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals, state officers and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a data breach of computer databases or physical documents that contain certain types of non-public personal information and present a risk for unauthorized use or potential harm. 

The collection, transfer, disclosure, use and storage of personal information required to provide our services is subject to data privacy laws in countries outside of the United States, such as laws adopted pursuant to the EU's 95/46 EC Directive of the European Parliament, and other national and provincial laws throughout the world. In some cases, these laws are more restrictive than the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and impose more stringent duties on companies. As in the United States, areas of concern include online and mobile applications. These laws, which are not uniform, do one or more of the following: regulate the collection, transfer (including in some cases, the transfer outside the country of collection), processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices, and give individuals certain access and correction rights with respect to their personal information and prevent the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes such as marketing. Under certain circumstances, some of these laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals, data protection authorities and/or other regulators in the event of a data breach. The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union are expected to adopt a comprehensive general data privacy regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;) in 2016 that will replace the current EU Data Protection Directive and related country-specific legislation. The GDPR is anticipated to take effect in mid-2018. We are analyzing the GDPR to determine its potential effects on our business practices. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices. 

These regulations, laws and industry standards also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of internal data security standards, controls or guidelines. Western Union maintains and upgrades its systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets. For further discussion of these risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors &#32;- " Breaches of our information security policies or safeguards could adversely affect our ability to operate and could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows ." 

In connection with regulatory requirements to assist in the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing and pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations, Western Union makes information available to certain United States federal, state, and foreign government agencies when required by law. In recent years, Western Union has experienced increasing data sharing requests by these agencies, particularly in connection with efforts to prevent terrorist financing or reduce the risk of identity theft. During the same period, there has also been increased public attention to the corporate use and disclosure of personal information, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer privacy. These regulatory goals - the prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and identity theft and the protection of the individual's right to privacy - may conflict, and the law in these areas is not consistent or settled. While we believe that Western Union is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities in all material respects, the legal, political and business environments in these areas are rapidly changing, and subsequent legislation, regulation, litigation, court rulings or other events could expose Western Union to increased program costs, liability and reputational damage. 

Banking Regulations 

We have subsidiaries that operate under banking licenses granted by the Austrian Financial Market Authority and the Brazilian Central Bank. We are also subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the New York State Department of Financial Services (the "Financial Services Department"), which has regulatory authority over our entity that holds all interests in these subsidiaries. Further, an Agreement of Supervision with the Financial Services Department imposes various regulatory requirements including operational limitations, capital requirements, affiliate transaction limitations, and notice and reporting requirements on this entity. However, because this entity and its subsidiaries do not exercise banking powers in the United States, we are not subject to the Bank Holding Company Act in the United States. 

Other 

Some of our services are subject to card association rules and regulations. For example, an independent standards-setting organization, the Payment Card Industry ("PCI") Security Standards Council (including American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide and Visa Inc. International) developed a set of comprehensive requirements concerning payment card account security through the transaction process, called the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ("PCI DSS"). All merchants and service providers that store, process and transmit payment card data are required to comply with PCI DSS as a condition to accepting credit cards. We are subject to annual reviews to ensure compliance with PCI regulations worldwide and are subject to fines if we are found to be non-compliant. 

Employees and Labor 

As of December 31, 2015 , our businesses employed approximately 10,000 employees, of which approximately 8,000 employees are located outside the United States.
