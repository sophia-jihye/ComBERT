&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of patients by delivering high quality pharmaceutical products through our contract manufacturing business and through advancing and licensing our novel, development-stage immunotherapy products.

&#160;

Avid Bioservices, Inc. (&#8220;Avid&#8221;) is a contract development and manufacturing organization (&#8220;CDMO&#8221;) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Peregrine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;Peregrine&#8221;). In June 2016, we announced a new corporate strategy to achieve profitability within two (2) years (during the quarter ending July 31, 2018), and at the same time, refocus our internal drug development efforts on small, early stage clinical trials designed to attract partnering interest in our investigational products.

&#160;

Avid is a CDMO that provides fully integrated current good manufacturing practices (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) services from cell line development to commercial biomanufacturing for its third-party customers while also supporting development and manufacturing of our internal products. Avid, which was established in 2002 and began commercial production in 2005, has over 15 years of experience producing monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins in batch, fed-batch and perfusion modes. Its services include cGMP clinical and commercial manufacturing utilizing stainless steel and single use bioreactor technology, purification, bulk packaging, stability testing, regulatory strategy and related support. Avid also provides a variety of process development activities, including cell line development and optimization, cell culture and feed optimization, analytical methods development and product characterization.

&#160;

Our objectives for our contract manufacturing business in the coming fiscal year include:

&#160;

&#183; Continue to grow contract manufacturing revenue; &#183; Successfully complete multiple process validations, which are critical elements in preparing a facility to launch commercial manufacturing activities; this milestone would move us a key step closer to generating revenue from commercial production out of our new Myford manufacturing facility; and &#183; Expand our CDMO capacity and capabilities, including the construction of a third manufacturing facility focused on products in clinical development. &#160;

&#160;

Peregrine operates our drug development business focused on developing therapeutics designed to fight cancer by reversing the immunosuppressive environment that many tumors establish in order to proliferate. By doing so, these therapeutics allow the immune system to recognize and destroy tumor cells. Bavituximab is our lead immunotherapy candidate, and we currently have clinical collaborations with AstraZeneca and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network&#174; (&#8220;NCCN&#8221;), as well as a preclinical collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (&#8220;MSKCC&#8221;), all of which are evaluating the potential of bavituximab in combination with immune stimulating therapies. Our clinical development strategy is focused on conducting small, early stage studies combining bavituximab with immune stimulating therapies. These trials may be conducted independently, in conjunction with our collaborators, or through investigator sponsored trials (&#8220;ISTs&#8221;). The goal of these trials is to generate compelling clinical and translational data demonstrating bavituximab&#8217;s immunotherapeutic mechanism of action in a combination treatment setting. We plan to leverage this data to attract partnering interest in our phosphatidylserine (&#8220;PS&#8221;)-targeting platform.

&#160;

Our objectives for our drug development business in the coming fiscal year include:

&#160;

&#183; Complete data collection and analysis from our discontinued Phase III SUNRISE trial in order to determine the optimal path forward for bavituximab; &#183; Initiate clinical trials to evaluate bavituximab in combination with immune stimulating therapies; &#183; Support new ISTs, which have the potential to provide further validation of bavituximab&#8217;s immunotherapeutic mechanism of action in the clinic; and &#183; Generate additional preclinical, translational, and clinical data to further demonstrate the immunotherapeutic mechanism of action of bavituximab as we continue to identify new clinical indications, therapeutic combinations and potential partnerships. &#160;

We were originally incorporated in the State of California in June 1981 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware on September 25, 1996. Our principal executive offices are located at 14282 Franklin Avenue, Tustin, California, 92780 and our telephone number is (714) 508-6000. Our internet website addresses are www.peregrineinc.com and www.avidbio.com. Information contained on, or accessed through, our websites does not constitute any part of this Annual Report.

&#160;

Avid&#8212;Our CDMO 

&#160;

Our contract manufacturing business provides fully-integrated cGMP services from cell line development to commercial biomanufacturing for third-party customers while also supporting our internal drug development activities. Avid&#8217;s total revenue generated from third-party customers for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 amounted to $44,357,000, $26,744,000, and $22,294,000, respectively.

&#160;

Avid has over 15 years of experience producing monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins in batch, fed-batch and perfusion modes. Its services include cGMP clinical and commercial product manufacturing utilizing stainless steel and single use bioreactor technology, purification, bulk packaging, stability testing and regulatory strategy and support. Avid also provides a variety of process development activities, including cell line development and optimization, cell culture and feed optimization, analytical methods development and product characterization. 

&#160;

In March 2016, we formally commissioned our new Myford bioprocessing facility, which doubled our manufacturing capacity. The 40,000 square foot biomanufacturing facility, which is our second manufacturing facility, is designed to utilize single-use equipment up to the 2,000-liter manufacturing scale to accommodate a fully disposable biomanufacturing process for products in late stage clinical development to commercial. This facility has completed its initial process validation runs for an internal product and is ramping up to conduct multiple new process validation runs for its third-party customers. Completion of these process validation runs moves us a step closer to generating revenue from commercial production from this new manufacturing suite, provided our third-party customers&#8217; products are approved. The new facility is located adjacent to our current headquarters in Tustin, California.

&#160;

As we look to expand our CDMO capacity and capabilities, we are planning to construct a third manufacturing facility focused on products in clinical development that we believe will further significantly increase our manufacturing capacity. We have secured a 25,000 square foot location in close proximity to our current campus and intend for the new clinical suite to be complete and ready for clinical manufacturing activities in the first half of calendar year 2017.

&#160;

To date, Avid has been audited and qualified by large and small, domestic and foreign, biotechnology companies interested in the production of biologic material for clinical and commercial use. Additionally, Avid has been audited by several regulatory agencies, including the FDA, European Medicines Agency, the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency and the California Department of Health.

Peregrine&#8212;Our Drug Development Business 

&#160; 

Our drug development business is focused on developing therapeutics designed to fight cancer by reversing the immunosuppressive environment that many tumors establish in order to proliferate. By doing so, these therapeutics allow the immune system to recognize and destroy tumor cells. Bavituximab is our lead immunotherapy candidate, and we currently have clinical collaborations with AstraZeneca and NCCN, as well as a preclinical collaboration with MSKCC, all of which are evaluating the potential of bavituximab in combination with stimulating therapies.

&#160;

Bavituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets and binds to PS, a highly immunosuppressive molecule that is usually located inside the membrane of healthy cells, but then &#8220;flips&#8221; and becomes exposed on the outside of cells in the tumor microenvironment, causing the tumor to evade immune detection. Bavituximab targets and binds to PS to block this immunosuppressive pathway and simultaneously activates adaptive immunity, thereby enabling the immune system to recognize and fight the tumor.

&#160;

Clinical Development Strategy 

&#160; 

In June 2016, we announced a clinical development strategy focused on conducting small, early stage studies of bavituximab in combination with immune stimulating therapies. These trials may be conducted independently, in conjunction with our collaborators, or through ISTs. The goal of these trials will be to generate compelling clinical and translational data demonstrating bavituximab&#8217;s immunotherapeutic mechanism of action in a combination treatment setting. We plan to leverage this data to drive partnering interest in our PS-targeting platform.

&#160;

We believe this strategy will allow us to (i) continue our research and development activities while avoiding costly, later-stage clinical trials, thereby allowing us to achieve profitability sooner, and (ii) generate additional data that we believe, if positive, could generate future potential value, including attracting potential licensing partners.

&#160;

Collaboration with AstraZeneca Combining Bavituximab and Durvalumab (MEDI4736) 

&#160; 

In August 2015, we entered into our first clinical collaboration with AstraZeneca to evaluate the combination of bavituximab and durvalumab (MEDI4736), an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, with chemotherapy in a planned Phase I/Ib trial in multiple solid tumors. In October 2015, we expanded our clinical collaboration with AstraZeneca to evaluate the combination of bavituximab and durvalumab in a Phase II study in patients with previously-treated squamous or non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (&#8220;NSCLC&#8221;).

&#160;

As discussed above, in June 2016, we announced a shift in corporate strategy to focus exclusively on small, early stage clinical trials combining bavituximab with immune stimulating therapies. For this reason, we will not proceed with any previously planned Phase II clinical trials. We are currently conducting an extensive review and analysis of the available clinical data and testing the numerous collected biomarkers samples in order to determine if certain subgroups or other patient characteristics benefited more from bavituximab. We believe such information will be critical in helping guide the bavituximab clinical program including our collaboration with AstraZeneca.

&#160;

NCCN Collaboration 

&#160;

In January 2016, we announced that we entered into a research collaboration with NCCN, a not-for-profit alliance of 27 of the world&#8217;s leading cancer centers, to expand the clinical research and development of bavituximab for the treatment of a range of tumors. Under this research collaboration, we plan to fund multiple ISTs and correlative studies with bavituximab at NCCN member institutions and their affiliate community hospitals through a $2 million research grant to NCCN's Oncology Research Program. NCCN will be responsible for oversight and monitoring of all clinical studies under the research grant. It is expected that between two and five different clinical studies will be conducted as part of this collaboration, potentially providing us with significant human data to steer future development of bavituximab. While specific timing has not been established, we expect that the first studies will be initiated in late calendar year 2016 or early 2017.

&#160;

Bavituximab in Front-Line Rectal Adenocarcinoma IST 

&#160;

This Phase I IST was designed to assess bavituximab in combination with capecitabine and radiation therapy in up to 18 patients with Stage II or III rectal adenocarcinoma. The primary endpoint is to determine the safety, feasibility and tolerability with a standard platform of capecitabine and radiation therapy. Secondary endpoints include overall response rate and pathological complete response (pCR) rate in patients. Patient enrollment was completed in October 2015 and we anticipate the investigator will present data from this trial in calendar year 2016.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Phase III SUNRISE Trial 

&#160; 

In December 2013, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial evaluating bavituximab plus docetaxel versus docetaxel plus placebo, for the treatment of previously-treated NSCLC (the &#8220;Phase III SUNRISE trial&#8221;).

&#160;

In February 2016, we announced that we were discontinuing the Phase III SUNRISE trial based on the recommendation of the study&#8217;s Independent Data Monitoring Committee following a pre-specified interim analysis performed after 33% of targeted overall events (patient deaths) in the study were reached. Results of the analysis demonstrated that the patients treated in the bavituximab plus docetaxel treatment arm did not show a sufficient improvement in overall survival as compared to the patients treated in the docetaxel plus placebo treatment arm to warrant continuation of the study. Patient enrollment has been discontinued and existing patients in the trial have been given the choice to continue chemotherapy and/or bavituximab, as appropriate. Clinical trial data from the study will continue to be collected until trial completion. Meanwhile, we are currently conducting an extensive review and analysis of the available clinical data and testing the numerous collected biomarkers samples in order to determine if certain subgroups or other patient characteristics benefited more from bavituximab. We believe such information will be critical in supporting our clinical strategy as discussed above.

&#160;

In-Licensing Agreements

&#160;

The following represents a summary of our key in-licensing agreements covering our products in clinical development.

&#160;

Bavituximab

&#160;

In August 2001 and August 2005, we exclusively in-licensed the worldwide rights to the PS-targeting technology platform from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas (&#8220;UTSWMC&#8221;), including bavituximab. In November 2003, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with Genentech, Inc. (&#8220;Genentech&#8221;), to license certain intellectual property rights covering methods and processes for producing antibodies used in connection with the development of our PS-targeting program. In December 2003, we entered into an exclusive commercial license agreement with Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (&#8220;Avanir&#8221;) covering the generation of a chimeric monoclonal antibody. In March 2005, we entered into a worldwide non-exclusive license agreement with Lonza Biologics (&#8220;Lonza&#8221;) for intellectual property and materials relating to the expression of recombinant monoclonal antibodies for use in the manufacture of bavituximab.

&#160;

Under our in-licensing agreements relating to bavituximab, we are obligated to pay future milestone payments based on potential clinical development and regulatory milestones, plus a royalty on net sales and/or a percentage of sublicense income. The applicable royalty rate under each of the foregoing in-licensing agreements is in the low single digits. During fiscal year 2014, we expensed $125,000 associated with milestone obligations under in-licensing agreements covering bavituximab, which is included in research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We did not incur any milestone related expenses during fiscal years 2016 and 2015.

&#160;

The following table provides certain information with respect to each of our in-licensing agreements relating to our bavituximab program.

&#160;

Licensor &#160; &#160; Agreement Date &#160; Total Milestone Obligations Expensed To Date &#160; &#160; Potential Future Milestone Obligations (1) 

&#160; &#160; UTSWMC &#160; &#160; August 2001 &#160; $ 173,000 &#160; &#160; $ 300,000 &#160; &#160; UTSWMC &#160; &#160; August 2005 &#160; &#160; 85,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 375,000 &#160; &#160; Lonza &#160; &#160; March 2005 &#160; &#160; 64,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8211; (2) &#160; Avanir &#160; &#160; December 2003 &#160; &#160; 100,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,000,000 &#160; &#160; Genentech &#160; &#160; November 2003 &#160; &#160; 500,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,000,000 &#160; &#160; Total &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 922,000 &#160; &#160; $ 6,675,000 &#160; ______________

(1) Under our current agreements, potential future milestone obligations are due upon achieving certain clinical and regulatory milestones. Based on the current stage of clinical development for bavituximab, future milestone obligations would be due upon submission of a biologics license application in the U.S. and upon FDA approval, which events are currently uncertain and depend on positive clinical trial results. In addition, potential future milestone obligations vary by license agreement (as defined in each license agreement) and certain agreements depend on a valid patent claim, as defined in each of these underlying agreements, at the time the potential milestone is achieved. (2) In the event we utilize a third-party contract manufacturer other than Lonza to manufacture bavituximab for commercial purposes, we would owe Lonza 300,000 pounds sterling per year. &#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We do not expect to incur any milestone related expenses regarding our bavituximab program during fiscal year 2017. In addition, of the total potential future milestone obligations of $6,675,000, up to $6,400,000 would be due upon the first commercial approval of bavituximab pursuant to these in-licensing agreements. However, given the uncertainty of the drug development and the regulatory approval process, we are unable to predict with any certainty when any of these future milestones will occur, if at all.

&#160;

Other In-Licensing Agreement Covering a Third-Party Product Development Program 

&#160; 

In July 2009, we entered into a patent assignment and sublicense with Affitech whereby we out-licensed exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize certain products under our anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (&#8220;VEGF&#8221;) intellectual property portfolio as further described in the &#8220;Out-Licensing Collaborations&#8221; section below. The underlying technology licensed to Affitech was in-licensed from UTSWMC in August 2001 under an exclusive worldwide license agreement. Under the UTSWMC license agreement, as amended, our aggregate future milestone obligations are $375,000 assuming the achievement of all development milestones by Affitech. During fiscal year 2016, we expensed $75,000 associated with milestone obligations under the UTSWMC license agreement, which is included in research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We did not incur any milestone related expenses during fiscal years 2015 and 2014. In addition, we do not expect to incur any milestone related expenses under the UTSWMC license agreement during fiscal year 2017. 

&#160;

Out-Licensing Agreements 

&#160; 

The following represents a summary of our key out-licensing agreements:

&#160;

In October 2000, we entered into a licensing agreement with Merck KGaA to out-license a segment of our Tumor Necrosis Therapy technology for use in the application of cytokine fusion proteins. In January 2003, we entered into an amendment to the license agreement, whereby we received an extension to the royalty period from six years to ten years from the date of the first commercial sale. Under the terms of the agreement, we would receive a royalty on net sales if a product is approved under the agreement. Merck KGaA is currently in the clinical development stage of this program.

&#160;

In July 2009, we entered into a patent assignment and sublicense (collectively, the &#8220;Affitech Agreements&#8221;) with Affitech whereby we licensed exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize certain products under our anti-VEGF intellectual property portfolio, including the fully human antibody AT001/r84. In September 2010, we and Affitech agreed to amend certain terms of the Affitech Agreements for sublicenses entered into by Affitech with non-affiliates for the territories of Brazil, Russia and other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (&#8220;CIS&#8221;) (the &#8220;September 2010 Amendment&#8221;). Under the amended terms, we agreed to forego our aforementioned sublicense fee equal to forty-five percent (45%) of the payments received by Affitech (after Affitech deducts fifty percent (50%) of its incurred development costs under the program) for the territories of Brazil, Russia, and the CIS, if Affitech reinvests such sublicense payments toward the further development of AT001/r84 in those territories. In the event Affitech enters into a licensing transaction for AT001/r84 with a non-affiliate in a major pharmaceutical market (defined as U.S., European Union, Switzerland, United Kingdom and/or Japan), Affitech has agreed to reimburse us the aforementioned sublicense fees we agreed to forego that were applied to the AT001/r84 program while Affitech will be eligible to be reimbursed for up to 50% of their development costs in Brazil, Russia and CIS territories. The remaining terms of the Affitech Agreements remain unchanged, including milestone and royalty payments. To date, we have not received any payments from Affitech under the September 2010 Amendment.

&#160;

We recognized revenue of $37,000, $37,000 and $107,000 during fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, under the Affitech Agreements, which amounts are included in license revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

&#160;

Government Regulation

&#160;

Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant factor in our ongoing research and development activities and in the production of our products under development. Our products and our research and development activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the U.S., including the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, the Public Health Service Act, as amended, as well as to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. These laws, and similar laws outside the U.S., govern the clinical and non-clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, distribution, sale, import, export, storage, record keeping, reporting, advertising and promotion of our products, if approved. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage may result in various adverse consequences, including regulatory delay in approving or refusal to approve a product, enforcement actions, including withdrawal of approval, labeling restrictions, seizure of products, fines, injunctions and/or civil or criminal penalties. Any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in a particular country.

&#160;

The regulatory process, which includes extensive preclinical testing and clinical trials of each product candidate to study its safety and efficacy, is uncertain, takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The activities required before a product, such as bavituximab, may be marketed in the U.S. are generally performed in the following sequential steps:

&#160;

1. Preclinical testing. This generally includes evaluation of our products in the laboratory or in animals to characterize the product and determine safety and efficacy. Some preclinical studies must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA regulations regarding good laboratory practice. &#160;

2. Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) application. The results of preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and proposed clinical trial protocols, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application, which must become effective before the clinical trials can begin. Once a new IND application is filed, the FDA has 30 days to review the IND application. The IND application will automatically become effective 30 days after the FDA receives the application, unless the FDA indicates prior to the end of the 30-day period that the application raises concerns that must be resolved to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction before clinical trials may proceed. If the FDA raises concerns at any time, we may be unable to resolve the issues in a timely fashion, if at all. &#160;

3. Completion of clinical trials. Human clinical trials are necessary to seek approval for a new drug or biologic and typically involve a three-phase process. In Phase I, small clinical trials are generally conducted to determine the safety of the product. In Phase II, clinical trials are generally conducted to assess safety and acceptable dose and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the product. In Phase III, clinical trials are generally conducted to provide sufficient data for the statistically valid proof of safety and efficacy. A clinical trial must be conducted according to good clinical practices under protocols that detail the trial&#8217;s objectives, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated, and informed consent must be obtained from all study subjects. Each protocol involving U.S. trial sites must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND application. The FDA may impose a clinical hold on an ongoing clinical trial if, for example, safety concerns arise, in which case the study cannot recommence without FDA authorization under terms sanctioned by the FDA. Similarly, trials conducted outside the U.S. require notification and/or approval by the governing health authority. In addition, before a clinical trial can be initiated, each clinical site or hospital administering the product must have the protocol reviewed and approved by an institutional review board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;) or independent ethics committee (&#8220;IEC&#8221;). The IRB/IEC will consider, among other things, ethical factors and the safety of human subjects. The IRB/IEC may require changes in a protocol, which may delay initiation or completion of a study. Phase I, Phase II or Phase III clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specific period of time, if at all, with respect to any of our potential products. Furthermore, we, the governing health authority (including the FDA) or an IRB/IEC may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. &#160;

&#160; 4. Submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;) or New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;). After completion of clinical studies for an investigational product, a BLA or NDA is submitted to the FDA for product marketing approval. No action can be taken to market any new drug or biologic product in the U.S. until the FDA has approved an appropriate marketing application. 

&#160;

5. FDA review and approval of the BLA or NDA before the product is commercially sold or shipped. The results of preclinical studies, clinical trials and manufacturing information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA or NDA for approval to manufacture, market and ship the product for commercial use. The FDA may take a number of actions after the BLA or NDA is filed, including but not limited to, denying the BLA or NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, requiring additional clinical testing or information, or requiring post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the product&#8217;s use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. Any adverse event, either before or after marketing approval, can result in product liability claims against us. &#160;

In addition, we are subject to regulation under state, federal, and international laws and regulations regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, the use and handling of radioactive isotopes, environmental protection and hazardous substance control, and other regulations. Our clinical trial and research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our financial resources. In addition, disposal of radioactive materials used in our clinical trials and research efforts may only be made at approved facilities. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including those relating to the handling and disposal of hazardous and toxic waste.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our product candidates, if approved, may also be subject to import laws in other countries, the food and drug laws in various states in which the products are or may be sold and subject to the export laws of agencies of the U.S. government.

&#160;

In addition, we must also adhere to cGMP and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. Failure to comply with manufacturing regulations can result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution.

&#160;

The FDA has designated as a Fast Track development program the investigation of bavituximab, in combination with docetaxel, to improve overall survival in patients with previously-treated, non-squamous, NSCLC compared with docetaxel alone. This designation facilitates the development and expedites the review of new drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The Fast Track mechanism is described in the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997. The benefits of Fast Track include scheduled meetings to seek FDA input into development plans, the option of submitting a BLA in sections rather than all components simultaneously and the option of requesting evaluation of studies using surrogate endpoints.

&#160;

Manufacturing and Raw Materials

&#160;

We manufacture cGMP pharmaceutical-grade products for our customers and to supply our clinical trials through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Avid. The process for manufacturing generally uses commercially available raw materials from multiple suppliers, and in some instances, from a sole source supplier. We currently do not have long-term supply contracts with these suppliers, and accordingly, we may experience delays in receiving raw materials to support the manufacturing of these cGMP pharmaceutical-grade products. However, to date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining these raw materials.

&#160;

Patents and Trade Secrets

&#160;

We continue to seek patents on inventions originating from our ongoing research and development activities and in collaboration with other companies and university researchers. In addition to seeking patent protection in the U.S., we typically file patent applications in Europe, Canada, Japan and additional countries on a selective basis. Patents, issued or applied for, cover inventions relating in general to cancer therapy and anti-viral therapy and in particular to different proteins, peptides, antibodies and conjugates, methods and devices for labeling antibodies, and therapeutic and diagnostic uses of the peptides, antibodies and conjugates. We intend to pursue opportunities to license these technologies and any advancements or enhancements, as well as to pursue the incorporation of our technologies in the development of our own products.

&#160;

Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing and/or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. In the U.S., patents issued on applications filed prior to June 8, 1995 have a term of 17 years from the issue date or 20 years from the earliest effective filing date, whichever is longer. U.S. patents issued on applications filed on or after June 8, 1995, have a term first calculated as 20 years from the earliest effective filing date, not counting any provisional application filing date. Certain U.S. patents issued on applications filed on or after June 8, 1995, and particularly on applications filed on or after May 29, 2000, are eligible for Patent Term Adjustment, which extends the term of the patent to compensate for delays in examination at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The term of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but is typically 20 years from the effective filing date, which is often the filing date of an application under the provisions of the Patent Cooperation Treaty.

&#160;

In addition, in certain cases, the term of U.S. and foreign patents can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of health authority regulatory review. As such, certain U.S. patents may be eligible for Patent Term Extension under 35 U.S.C. &#167; 156 (known as &#8220;the Hatch-Waxman Act&#8221;) to restore the portion of the patent term that has been lost as a result of review at the U.S. FDA. Such extensions, which may be up to a maximum of five years (but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years), are potentially available to one U.S. patent that claims an approved human drug product (including a human biological product), a method of using a drug product, a method of manufacturing a drug product, or a medical device.

&#160;

We consider that in the aggregate our patents, patent applications and licenses under patents owned by third parties are of material importance to our operations. Of the patent portfolios that are owned, controlled by or exclusively licensed to us, those concerning our PS-Targeting technology platform, including bavituximab are of particular importance to our operations and our clinical pipeline.

&#160;

Our patent portfolios relating to the PS-Targeting technology platform in oncology include U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications with claims directed to methods, compositions and combinations for targeting tumor vasculature and imaging and treating cancer using antibodies and conjugates that localize to the aminophospholipids, PS (Phosphatidylserine) and PE (Phosphatidylethanolamine), exposed on tumor vascular endothelial cells. These patents are currently set to expire between 2019 and 2021.

&#160;

Our patent portfolios relating to the PS-Targeting technology platform in the viral field include U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications with claims directed to methods, compositions and combinations for inhibiting viral replication or spread and for treating viral infections and diseases using antibodies, certain peptides and conjugates that localize to the aminophospholipids, PS and PE, exposed on viruses and virally-infected cells. Such anti-viral patents concerning antibodies and conjugates are currently set to expire in 2023.

&#160;

Additionally, we have U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications relating more specifically to our product, bavituximab, including composition of matter, combinations and methods of use in treating angiogenesis and cancer and in treating viral infections and diseases, alone and in combination therapies. These patents that more specifically concern bavituximab compositions and their use in treating cancer, both alone and in combination therapies, are currently set to expire between 2023 and 2025.

&#160;

The information given above is based on our current understanding of the patents and patent applications that we own, control, or have exclusively licensed. The information is subject to revision, for example, in the event of changes in the law or legal rulings affecting our patents, or if we become aware of new information. In particular, the expiry information given above does not account for possible extension of any U.S. or foreign patent to recapture patent term effectively lost as a result of FDA or other health authority regulatory review. We intend to seek such extensions, as appropriate to approved product(s), which may be up to a maximum of five years (but not extending the term of a patent beyond 14 years).

&#160;

The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. We have either been issued patents or have patent applications pending that relate to a number of current and potential products including products licensed to others. In general, we have obtained licenses from various parties that we deem to be necessary or desirable for the manufacture, use or sale of our products. These licenses (both exclusive and non-exclusive) generally require us to pay royalties to the parties.

&#160;

We also own trademarks to protect the names of our products and services. Trademark protection continues in some countries so long as the trademark is used, and in other countries, so long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely.

&#160;

With respect to our contract manufacturing business, we have acquired and developed and continue to acquire and develop knowledge and expertise (&#34;know-how&#34;) and trade secrets in the provision of process development and manufacturing services. Our know-how and trade secrets may not be patentable, but they are valuable in that they enhance our ability to provide high-quality services to our customers. We also intend to continue to rely upon trade secrets and improvements, unpatented proprietary know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position in research and development of our therapeutic and diagnostic products. We typically place restrictions in our agreements with third-parties, which contractually restrict their right to use and disclose any of our proprietary technology with which they may be involved. In addition, we have internal non-disclosure safeguards, including confidentiality agreements, with our employees.

&#160;

Segment Information

&#160;

Our business is organized into two reportable operating segments. Peregrine is engaged in the research and development of monoclonal antibodies focused on the treatment of cancer and has not generated any product sales from any of its technologies under development. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Avid, is engaged in providing fully-integrated cGMP biomanufacturing services for us and its third-party customers. In addition, we had no foreign based operations and no long-lived assets located in foreign countries as of and for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Refer to Note 10, &#8220;Segment Reporting&#8221; to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional financial information regarding our operating segments.

&#160;

Customers

&#160;

Contract manufacturing revenue has historically been derived from a small customer base. These third-party customers typically do not enter into long-term commitments because their need for product supply depends on a variety of factors, including the products stage of development, their financial resources, and, the market demand with respect to commercial products. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from any one of our primary customers is significantly reduced or eliminated. During fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, Avid&#8217;s total revenue generated from third-party customers amounted to $44,357,000, $26,744,000, and $22,294,000, respectively, of which 69%, 79% and 91%, respectively, was derived from Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. In addition, contract manufacturing from third-party customers outside the United States represented less than 1% of the contract manufacturing revenue recognized during fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014. Refer to Note 10, &#8220;Segment Reporting&#8221; to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional financial information regarding Avid&#8217;s customer concentration and geographic areas of its customers.

Competition

&#160;

The CDMO and pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Our competition in the CDMO market includes full-service contract manufacturers and large pharmaceutical companies offering third-party manufacturing services to fill their excess capacity. Also, large pharmaceutical companies have been seeking to divest portions of their manufacturing capacity, and any such divested businesses may compete with us in the future. In addition, most of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or other resources than we do. Moreover, additional competition may emerge and may, among other things, result in a decrease in the fees paid for our services, which would affect our results of operations and financial condition.

&#160;

Our competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry includes several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies actively engaged in research and development of immunotherapy-based products that have commenced clinical trials with, or have successfully commercialized, these products. Some or all of these companies may have greater financial resources, larger technical staffs and larger research budgets than we have, as well as greater experience in developing products and running clinical trials.

&#160;

With respect to our lead immunotherapy candidate, bavituximab, in February 2016, we discontinued our Phase III SUNRISE trial for the treatment of NSCLC. We are currently conducting an extensive review and analysis of the available clinical data and testing the numerous collected biomarkers samples in order to determine if certain subgroups or other patient characteristics benefited more from bavituximab. In addition, in June 2016 we announced our strategy to focus exclusively on small, early stage clinical trials combining bavituximab with immune stimulating therapies Therefore, our immediate competition is currently undefined until we have additional data from the Phase III SUNRISE trial or from other planned trials.

&#160;

Research and Development

&#160;

The majority of our operating expenses to date is related to research and development. Research and development expenses primarily include (i) payroll and related costs, including share-based compensation, associated with research and development personnel, (ii) costs related to clinical trials and preclinical testing of our technologies under development, (iii) costs to develop and manufacture the product candidates, including raw materials and supplies, product testing, depreciation, and facility related expenses, (iv) expenses for research services provided by universities and contract laboratories, including sponsored research funding, and (v) other research and development expenses. Research and development expenses are charged to expense as incurred when these expenditures relate to our research and development efforts and have no alternative future uses. Research and development expenses were $59,529,000 in fiscal year 2016, $42,996,000 in fiscal year 2015, and $27,723,000 in fiscal year 2014.

&#160;

Human Resources

&#160;

As of April 30, 2016, we employed 281 full-time employees and three part-time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced employment-related work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
