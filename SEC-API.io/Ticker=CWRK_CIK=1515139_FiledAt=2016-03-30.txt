deterioration in general or regional economic conditions; 

&#160; &#183; 

adverse state or federal legislation or regulations that increase the costs of compliance;

Corporate Overview 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 20, 2010 and are considered a development stage company. Following incorporation, we commenced the business of representing authors to publishers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On August 28, 2014, pursuant to a transfer agreement dated for reference August 28, 2014, Mary Wolf, our former sole director and officer, sold to James P. Geiskopf, 3,000,000 shares of our common stock for total consideration of $20,000. Mr. Geiskopf paid the $20,000 purchase price for these shares using personal funds. Mr. Geiskopf holds approximately 50% of our issued and outstanding common stock. 

Effective August 28, 2014, Mr. Geiskopf was appointed as our president, secretary and treasurer and to our board of directors, and as a result, Ms. Wolf resigned as president, secretary and treasurer. Ms. Wolf resigned as a director of our company on November 17, 2014. 

The principal offices of our company are located at 3250 Oakland Hills Court, Fairfield, CA 94534. Our telephone number is 707.208.6368. 

Our Current Business 

Upon the resignation of Mary Wolf as an officer of our company, we ceased pursuing the business of representing authors to publishers and are now seeking new business opportunities with established business entities to effect a merger or other form of business combination with our company. We anticipate that any new acquisition or business opportunity that we may be party to will require additional financing. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to acquire the financing necessary to enable us to pursue our plan of operation and enter into such an agreement. If our company requires additional financing and we are unable to obtain such funds, our business will fail. 

Even if we are able to commence a new business opportunity and obtain the necessary funding, there is no assurance that we will be able to generate any revenue, or that any revenue that may be generated will be sufficient to provide a return to our investors. 

In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition or opportunity, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture or other business combination with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon the consummation of a transaction, it is likely that our present management will no longer be in control of our company. In addition, it is likely that some or all of our current management will resign and be replaced by one or more new officers or directors. 

We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and without certainty of success. We believe that there are numerous firms in various industries seeking the perceived benefits of being a publicly reporting corporation. Business opportunities may be available in many different industries and with businesses at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of our company to pursue may be scarce or we may be unable to obtain opportunities that we want. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities. 

As of the date hereof, we have not entered into any formal written agreements for a business combination or opportunity. When any such agreement is reached, we intend to disclose such an agreement by filing a current report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220; SEC &#8221;). 

Currently, we do not have a source of revenue. We are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations. Historically, we have been able to raise a limited amount of capital through private placements of our equity stock, but we are uncertain about our continued ability to raise funds privately. Further, we believe that our company may have difficulties raising capital until we locate a prospective business through which we can pursue our plan of operation. If we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our acquisition efforts, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and our business may fail
