Business 

Overview 

United Parcel Service, Inc. (&#8220;UPS&#8221;) was founded in 1907 as a private messenger and delivery service in Seattle, Washington. Today, we are the world&#8217;s largest package delivery company, a leader in the U.S. less-than-truckload industry and the premier provider of global supply chain management solutions. We deliver packages each business day for 1.6 &#32;million shipping customers to 8.4 &#32;million receivers ("consignees") in over 220 countries and territories. In 2015 , we delivered an average of 18.3 million &#32;pieces per day, or a total of 4.7 billion &#32;packages. Total revenue in 2015 &#32;was $ 58.4 billion . 

We are a global leader in logistics, and we create value for our customers through solutions that lower costs, improve service and provide highly customizable supply chain control and visibility. Customers are attracted to our broad set of services that are delivered as promised through our integrated ground, air and ocean global network. 

Our overall market strategy is to provide customers with advanced logistics solutions made possible by a broad portfolio of differentiated services and capabilities expertly assembled and integrated into our customers&#8217; businesses. This approach, supported by our efficient and globally balanced multimodal network, enables us to deliver considerable value to our customers and thereby build lasting partnerships with them. 

Over the last 15 years, we have significantly expanded the scope of our capabilities to include more than package delivery. Our logistics and distribution capabilities give companies the power to easily expand their businesses to new markets around the world. By leveraging our international infrastructure and know-how, UPS enables our customers to bridge time zones, cultures and distances to keep their supply chains moving smoothly. 

In 2015 , we continued our capabilities expansion by acquiring Coyote Logistics, a leading asset-light truckload broker, and several other specialized businesses. Each provides our customers with an ever-expanding range of high value services and expertise, while simultaneously contributing to operational efficiency and positive returns. 

We serve the global market for logistics services, which include transportation, distribution, contract logistics, ground freight, ocean freight, air freight, customs brokerage, insurance and financing. We have three reportable segments: U.S. Domestic Package, International Package and Supply Chain &#38; Freight, all of which are described below. For financial information concerning our reportable segments and geographic regions, refer to note 12 &#32;of our consolidated financial statements. 

Business Strategy 

Customers leverage our broad portfolio of logistics capabilities; balanced global presence in North America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America; reliability; industry-leading technologies; and solutions expertise for competitive advantage in markets where they choose to compete. We prudently invest to expand our integrated global network and service portfolio. 

Technology investments create user-friendly shipping, e-commerce, logistics management and visibility tools for our customers, while supporting our ongoing effort to increase operational efficiencies. We actively monitor and invest to gain insights into emerging technologies such as additive manufacturing (3D printing), route and network optimization tools, and advanced product monitoring and tracking functionality. 

Our service portfolio and investments are rewarded with among the best return on invested capital and operating margins in the industry. We have a long history of sound financial management and our consolidated balance sheet reflects financial strength that few companies can match. Cash generation is a significant strength of UPS, giving us strong capacity to service our obligations and allowing for distributions to shareowners, reinvestment in our business and the pursuit of growth opportunities. 

We enable and are the beneficiaries of the following trends: 

Expansion of Global Trade 

We continue to invest to expand in both developed and emerging international markets. In Europe, we have committed to nearly $2 billion of capital to expand our infrastructure to meet the growing demand for cross-border commerce. The enhancements to our European ground network are designed to ensure that we provide fast, reliable service to high-value customers moving goods across country borders. 

Emerging market opportunities continue to expand. Over the next ten years, these markets are expected to represent the majority of global GDP growth and an increasing proportion of global trade. Emerging markets are an understandable focus of investment and growth for our current customers and will be a source of our next generation of customers. To take advantage of these opportunities, we continue to make long-term investments in markets where our customers choose to grow. Over the past ten years, we have established a strong market presence in three leading emerging markets: China, Poland and Turkey. The Middle East, Latin America, Africa and Eastern Europe are also becoming increasingly important to us. 

Transcontinental and trade across borders are predicted to grow faster than U.S. and global gross domestic production for the foreseeable future. As a result, U.S. and international economies are becoming more inter-connected and dependent on foreign trade. 

UPS plays an important role in global trade and is well positioned to take advantage of trade growth, wherever it occurs. Our global presence and productivity enhancing technologies allow customers to expand into new markets. We advocate the expansion of free trade, including the passage of regional trade pacts and the removal of trade barriers. The 2015 Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement will connect 12 global economies and 800 million consumers across the Americas and the Asia-Pacific regions. We believe free trade is a catalyst for job creation, economic growth and improved living standards. 

These trends underscore why we believe our international business is a catalyst for our future growth. 

e-Commerce Growth in Retail Sectors 

Throughout much of the world, e-commerce growth continues to outpace traditional lines of business. Our integrated network puts us in an ideal position to capitalize on the shift towards residential deliveries. We continue to create new services, supported by our technology, that complement the traditional UPS premium home delivery service and address the needs of e-commerce shippers and consignees. Our offerings span a broad spectrum that supports retailers across their value chains, from global sourcing to distribution and returns. We offer cost-effective solutions such as UPS SurePost, for U.S. domestic shipments and UPS i-parcel for a low-cost deferred cross border solution, where economy takes precedence over speed. We also offer feature-rich solutions, such as UPS My Choice, a service that provides receivers with visibility and control of their inbound shipments. 

UPS My Choice keeps 22 million members up-to-date on their parcels&#8217; delivery status through proactive alerts and offers flexible delivery options to control when and where these deliveries are made. Following on the success of UPS My Choice in the U.S., we expanded the service to 15 additional countries and territories in the Americas and Europe regions. With UPS My Choice, receivers may adjust the timing and location of their deliveries to obtain delivery on the first attempt. We strive to give our customers the best delivery experience in the industry and we intend to continue to expand the service in new markets in conjunction with the growing UPS Access Point network. 

UPS My Choice members have the added flexibility to direct packages to UPS Access Point locations when they will not be home to accept a delivery. UPS Access Point locations are convenient places &#8211; such as the The UPS Store and other local businesses &#8211; that offer easy package drop-off and pickup. With evening and weekend hours, UPS Access Point locations better fit consumers&#8217; schedules. Merchants in nearly 50 origin countries and territories can ship directly to UPS Access Point locations in 12 destination countries, giving merchants and consumers greater control over package deliveries. At the end of 2015, we had more than 23,000 locations worldwide. In 2016, we plan to continue our expansion of UPS Access Point locations. This move enhances our cross-border e-commerce offerings for merchants, while increasing choice for their customers, who can opt to pick up and drop off parcels at retail locations that are convenient to them. 

Industry-focused Solutions and Offerings 

We offer differentiated value propositions in several segments, including aerospace, automotive, industrial manufacturing, retail, professional and consumer services, healthcare and high-tech. 

Our industry-specific solutions are increasingly tailored to align with customer needs in each of these sectors. Staying abreast of industry trends positions us to anticipate business challenges in each industry. We deepen our understanding by studying these challenges and engaging with customers at the strategic planning stage. We then align our logistics expertise to address these business challenges to help our customers compete. 

Our understanding of how macro and industry trends impact the stakeholders in each market allows us to develop commercial insights for our customers. These insights are incorporated into our sales and solutions process and are shared with customers through direct engagement, industry forums, and publications. We help customers achieve their business objectives and improve their performance through our value-added solutions. 

Demographic trends support growth in healthcare: an aging global population, a rising middle class and rapid urbanization are catalysts for chronic disease growth. The combination of rising global demand for healthcare, new product innovations, increasing regulatory demands and downward pressure on reimbursement is creating both opportunities and challenges for healthcare and life sciences firms. In today&#8217;s environment, healthcare logistics executives are most concerned with regulatory compliance, product security, supply chain cost management and product damage/spoilage. To address these challenges, more healthcare and life sciences companies are relying on partnerships with third party logistics providers to gain regulatory and trade management expertise, leverage scalable access to healthcare compliant infrastructure and to ensure product integrity through validated temperature and time-sensitive transportation solutions. 

Rapid technology innovation and growing worldwide demand for electronics are driving change in the already-dynamic high-tech industry. As the technology marketplace becomes more complex, high-tech companies are optimizing their supply chains to remain competitive. Every year, product life cycles are getting shorter, dictating the need for high-tech companies to better predict demand and understand their logistics requirements. Increasingly, they are looking to third party logistics providers for support in product launches, distribution, post-sales support and reverse logistics. 

We have the experience these companies need, as well as a global transportation network and integrated technology solutions that can generate supply chain efficiency. This means high-tech companies can get their products to market faster, improve customer service and boost revenue. We offer global sourcing and a significant amount of repair space to leverage one of the largest networks of post-sales facilities in the world. With more than 950 field stocking locations in over 110 countries, we help high-tech companies identify better ways to manage inventories and meet their crucial logistics needs. Our experience and global capabilities make us a strong partner in the high-tech industry. 

We are expanding our presence in the aerospace industry. The precise requirements of this industry&#8217;s manufacturing, assembly and post-sales fit well within our service portfolio. 

In each of our focus industries, our aim is to increase the number of customers using logistics capabilities across our portfolio. 

Logistics Outsourcing 

Outsourcing supply chain management is becoming more prevalent, as customers increasingly view professional management and operation of their supply chains as a strategic advantage. This trend enables companies to focus on what they do best. We can meet our customers&#8217; needs for outsourced logistics with our global capabilities in customized forwarding, transportation, warehousing, distribution, delivery and post-sales services. As we move deeper into customers&#8217; supply chains, we do so with a shared vision on how to best equip our customers with transportation and logistics solutions to better serve their customers. 

Technology 

Technology powers logistics, forms the foundation of our reliability and allows us to enhance the customer experience. Technology delivers value to our customers and returns to our shareowners. Recent developments that improve our operational efficiency, flexibility, reliability and customer experience include: 

&#8226; 

Continued rollout of telematics to our international delivery fleet to complement our telematics-enabled U.S. small package, freight forwarding and freight ground fleets. By the end of 2015, telematics was installed in close to 83,000 vehicles. Telematics helps UPS determine a truck&#8217;s performance and condition by capturing data on more than 200 related elements, including speed, RPM, oil pressure, seat belt use, number of times the vehicle is placed in reverse and idling time. Together, improved data and driver coaching help reduce fuel consumption, emissions and maintenance costs while improving driver safety. Additionally, customers experience more consistent pickup times and more reliable deliveries, thereby enhancing their profitability and competitiveness. 

&#8226; 

Expanded implementation of our On Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation system (ORION), which employs advanced algorithms to determine the optimal route for each delivery, while meeting service commitments. By the end of 2015, ORION was deployed to over 40,000 drivers. 

&#8226; 

Accelerated installations of our Next Generation Small Sort (NGSS) technology, which reduces the amount of memorization required to sort a package, thereby improving productivity and quality. Employees sort packages to bins tagged with flashing lights, rather than memorizing addresses, allowing us to dramatically reduce training time. NGSS has been deployed in about 300 sites globally. 

We bring industry-leading UPS technology to our customers who, in turn, realize increased productivity, greater control of their supply chains and improved customer experience when they integrate with our systems. Customers benefit through offerings such as: 

Shipping 

WorldShip&#8482;, which is our flagship desktop shipping application, provides middle market and large customers with robust shipping capabilities. Customers can create custom labels, set up shipment alerts, create and upload customs documentation, track and export shipments, create reports and integrate with their enterprise resource planning and accounting systems to streamline shipping with real-time connectivity. 

UPS marketplace shipping, which integrates www.ups.com &#32;with eBay&#174; and Amazon&#174;, allows marketplace sellers to easily ship their orders via www.ups.com &#32;or WorldShip. UPS marketplace shipping provides simplified shipment processing; multiple payment options, including PayPal&#8482;; order and shipment history; and automatic tracking updates. 

Tracking and Visibility 

UPS Quantum View&#174; can help customers better manage shipments, facilitate tracking, allow for inbound volume planning, manage third-party shipping costs and automatically notify customers of incoming shipments. With visibility into transit times and delivery confirmations, customers can speed up their revenue cycle and collect accounts receivables more quickly while improving customer service. 

International Trade Tools &#32; 

UPS Paperless&#8482; solutions allow customers to self-enroll in UPS Paperless&#8482; Invoice and upload shipping documents. These solutions enable customers to electronically transmit a commercial invoice, packing list or their own customs documents when shipping internationally. This eliminates redundant data entry and errors, while reducing customs delays and paper waste. 

UPS TradeAbility&#174; tools help customers effectively and confidently manage the movement of goods internationally in a timely, efficient and compliant manner. 

Billing &#32; 

The UPS Billing Center, a secure location for customers to view, download, manage and pay their UPS invoices, helps customers accelerate billing and payment processes. Customers can assign privileges with administrative controls, manage multiple accounts and create custom reports using a single simple interface. 

Integration 

The UPS Developer Kit, which is comprised of multiple Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), helps customers streamline and automate their internal business processes. The UPS Developer Kit APIs allow customers to integrate a wide range of UPS functionality into their business systems and websites such as address validation, shipment scheduling, selection of shipping service levels, tracking and much more. 

Business-to-Consumer 

We selectively choose UPS Access Point locations that meet our business standards and ensure the safety of our customers' packages. Then, we equip each one with the latest UPS technology to help make package pickup quick and convenient. Consumers can track their packages on www.ups.com , &#32;m.ups.com &#32;or the UPS Mobile app to know when their packages are ready for pickup. 

UPS My Choice&#174;, which focuses on the consignee, has transformed the residential delivery experience. Receivers can direct the timing and circumstances of their deliveries using their computer, mobile devices or Facebook&#8482; app. This innovative service is powered by the complex integration of real-time route optimization and other technologies within our delivery network. 

The Global Locator on www.ups.com &#32;was enhanced to give customers faster and simpler access to UPS drop-off and pickup locations, including new UPS Access Point sites. The Global Locator has a new single search field with updated filters, location images and location-specific promotions. Customers can also provide online feedback, e-mail search results, save favorite locations and access recent searches. 

Mobile 

UPS Mobile, which includes the mobile website, m.ups.com , and apps for iPhone&#174;, iPad&#174; and Android devices, is readily available for our customers in over 80 countries. Customers can track, ship, find UPS locations, manage UPS My Choice shipments and receive shipment notifications on their mobile devices. The UPS Mobile apps and website were enhanced so that customers can now convert a rate estimate into a shipment, ship a package without logging in, compare shipping services more easily, select PayPal&#8482; as a payment option, view details on shipping charges and utilize the redesigned Global Locator. 

Reporting Segments and Products &#38; Services 

As a global leader in logistics, we offer a broad range of domestic and export delivery services; the facilitation of international trade; and the deployment of advanced technologies to more efficiently manage the world of business. We seek to streamline our customers&#8217; shipment processing and integrate critical transportation information into their own business processes, helping them to create supply chain efficiencies, better serve their customers and improve cash flow. 

Global Small Package 

Our global small package operations provide time-definite delivery services for express letters, documents, small packages and palletized freight via air and ground services. We serve more than 220 &#32;countries and territories around the world along with domestic delivery service within 54 countries. We handle packages that weigh up to 150 pounds and are up to 165 inches in combined length and girth as well as palletized shipments weighing more than 150 pounds. All of our package services are supported by numerous shipping, visibility and billing technologies. 

We handle all levels of service (air, ground, domestic, international, commercial, residential) through one global integrated pickup and delivery network. All packages are commingled within our network, except when necessary to meet their specific service commitments. This enables one UPS driver to pick up customers&#8217; shipments for any of our services at the same scheduled time each day. Compared to companies with single service network designs, our integrated network uniquely provides operational and capital efficiencies while being more environmentally-friendly. 

We offer same-day pickup of air and ground packages upon request. Customers can schedule pickups for one to five days a week, based on their specific needs. Additionally, our wholly-owned and partnered global network offers more than 150,000 entry points where customers can tender a package to us at a location or time convenient to them. This combined network includes UPS drivers who can accept packages provided to them; UPS drop boxes; UPS Access Point locations; The UPS Store locations; authorized shipping outlets and commercial counters; alliance locations; and customer centers attached to UPS facilities. Some of these locations offer a full array of services including pickup, delivery and packing options, while others are drop-off locations only. We continually look for ways to enhance the customer experience by offering easy access to UPS. 

The growth of online shopping has increased our customers&#8217; needs for efficient and reliable returns, resulting in our development of a robust selection of returns services that are available in more than 145 countries. Options vary based on customer needs and country, and range from cost-effective solutions such as UPS Returns, to more-specialized services such as UPS Returns Exchange. UPS Returns enables shippers to provide their customers with a return shipping label, while UPS Returns Exchange simplifies product exchanges by delivering a replacement item and picking up a return item in the same stop, and assisting with the re-packaging process. 

We operate one of the largest airlines in the world, with global operations centered at our Worldport hub in Louisville, Kentucky. Worldport sort capacity, currently at 416,000 packages per hour, has expanded over the years due to volume growth and a centralization effort. Our European air hub is located in Cologne, Germany, and we maintain Asia-Pacific air hubs in Shanghai, China; Shenzhen, China; and Hong Kong. Our regional air hub in Canada is located in Hamilton, Ontario, and our regional air hub for Latin America and the Caribbean is in Miami, Florida. 

In the U.S., Worldport is supported by our regional air hubs in Columbia, South Carolina; Dallas, Texas; Ontario, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Rockford, Illinois. This network design allows for cost-effective package processing in our most technology-enabled facilities, which allow us to use fewer, larger and more fuel-efficient aircraft. Our U.S. ground fleet serves all business and residential zip codes in the contiguous U.S. 

U.S. Domestic Package Reporting Segment 

We are a leader in time-definite, money-back guaranteed, small package delivery services in the U.S. We offer a full spectrum of U.S. domestic guaranteed ground and air package transportation services. Depending on the delivery speed needed, customers can select from a range of guaranteed time and day-definite delivery options. 

&#8226; 

Customers can select from same day, next day, two day and three day delivery alternatives. Many of these services offer options that enable customers to specify a time-of-day guarantee for their delivery (e.g., by 8:00 AM, 10:30 AM, noon, end of day, etc.). 

&#8226; 

In 2015, we expanded UPS Next Day Air Early (previously known as "UPS Next Day Air Early AM") service to over 4,000 additional ZIP Codes where previously only an end-of-day guarantee was available. This enhancement provides shippers and their customers the option of an earlier first-of-day delivery with commit times from 8:00 AM to 2:00 PM and enlarged our early delivery coverage. With this expansion, more of our customers can get critical shipments delivered earlier, across the U.S. and from around the world. 

&#8226; 

Customers can also leverage our extensive ground network to ship using our day-definite guaranteed ground service that serves every U.S. business and residential address. We deliver more ground packages than any other carrier, with average daily package volume of 13 million in the U.S., most within one to three business days. 

&#8226; 

We also offer UPS SurePost, an economy residential ground service for customers with non-urgent, lightweight residential shipments. UPS SurePost is a contractual residential ground service that combines the consistency and reliability of the UPS Ground network with final delivery often provided by the U.S. Postal Service. 

Growth in U.S. online sales, which are estimated to nearly double by 2020, is driving significant growth in package delivery volume, with a large seasonal spike during peak season beginning at Thanksgiving and lasting through Christmas. In order to meet the demand and ensure successful peak season operations, we have invested over $1 billion in facility expansions and equipment modernization since 2014. We continue to make other improvements to effectively manage the seasonal volume fluctuations associated with peak season: 

&#8226; 

Enhancing Cyber Week operations in the U.S. including ground and air pickup and delivery operations on Black Friday. 

&#8226; 

Adding weekend pickup, sort, and delivery operations as needed in the U.S. to smooth out geographical spikes in volume. 

&#8226; 

Utilizing additional aircraft and regional air hubs to add significant capacity to our air network during critical periods. 

&#8226; 

Adding new delivery vehicles and trailers to our fleet of 100,000 package cars, vans, tractors, trailers and other vehicles. 

&#8226; 

Automating facilities to expand our existing capabilities through enhanced technology. 

&#8226; 

Updating www.ups.com &#32;and expanding UPS communications to enhance the timeliness and relevance of alerts when service disruptions occur. 

International Package Reporting Segment 

Our International Package reporting segment includes the small package operations in Europe, Asia-Pacific, Canada and Latin America, the Indian sub-continent and the Middle East and Africa. We offer a wide selection of guaranteed day and time-definite international shipping services. 

&#8226; 

We offer more guaranteed time-definite express options (Express Plus, Express and Express Saver) than any other carrier. 

&#8226; 

In 2015, we undertook the largest one-time expansion in the history of UPS Worldwide Express service by adding coverage to more than 41,000 new postal codes around the world, creating earlier guaranteed-delivery options for customers that previously had only end-of-day guarantees. UPS Worldwide Express service offers guaranteed delivery on the next possible business day by 10:30 AM, noon or 2:00 PM, depending on the destination, and is available in 65 countries. We will continue this expansion in 2016, with plans to add UPS Worldwide Express service to additional countries and postal codes. 

&#8226; 

For international shipments that do not require express services, UPS Worldwide Expedited offers a reliable, deferred, guaranteed day-definite service option. In 2013, we tripled the coverage area for UPS Worldwide Expedited, providing delivery in two-to-five business days to more than 220 countries and territories. We expanded our origin footprint for this service in 2015 by adding two new countries, bringing the total origins to more than 80. This expansion helps our customers magnify their global reach and balance delivery speed with cost, no matter where they ship. 

&#8226; 

For cross-border ground package delivery, we offer UPS Transborder (Express, Expedited and Standard) delivery services within Europe, between the U.S. and Canada and between the U.S. and Mexico. 

&#8226; 

In 2013, we introduced UPS Worldwide Express Freight for palletized shipments over 150 pounds. This service was enhanced to include a total of 58 origins and 56 destinations in 2015, enabling our customers to send their palletized shipments to more markets throughout the world. More expansion is planned for 2016 with additional origin and destination countries. UPS Worldwide Express Freight leverages our unique combination of package and freight networks to provide industry leading transit times with a money-back guarantee. 

Europe, our largest region outside of the U.S., accounts for approximately half of international revenue and is one of the primary drivers of our growth. Several characteristics of the European market provide us with opportunities, including its highly fragmented nature and the fact that exports make up a significant part of Europe&#8217;s GDP. To accommodate the strong potential for growth in small package exports, we expanded our facility at Nuremberg, Germany in the second quarter of 2015, doubling the sorting capacity to 30,000 packages per hour. 

Asia-Pacific remains a strategic market due to growth rates in intra-Asia trade, the expanding Chinese economy, and the trade opportunities created by the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. To capitalize on these opportunities, we are bringing faster time-in-transit to customers focused on intra-Asia trade, and reducing transit days from Asia to the U.S. and Europe. Through added flight frequencies, we provide our customers the ability to ship next day to more places in the U.S. and Europe, guaranteed, than any other express carrier. We continue to build our presence in China through the expansion of our service capabilities, investing in our transportation network and strengthening brand awareness across 13 cities. 

Additional international highlights include the following: 

&#8226; 

We expanded the International Special Commodities program in 2015 with the addition of seven destination countries. Customers can now ship biological substances, dry ice and dangerous goods to and from more than 50 countries around the world. 

&#8226; 

During 2015, we added Trade Management Services to the UPS customs brokerage portfolio in Asia to facilitate customers' expansion opportunities. These services include: trade consulting, import/export technologies and managed services. 

&#8226; 

By the end of 2015, we expanded the UPS Access Point network coverage to over 15,000 locations across 11 countries including Canada and Mexico (U.S. locations excluded). We plan to further expand the UPS Access Point network to new countries in 2016. 

&#8226; 

We increased the availability of the UPS Mobile App for Apple iPhone&#174; and Android devices to ten additional countries in 2015, for a total of 16 countries. The UPS Mobile App is now available in Austria, Belgium, Canada, 

Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Puerto Rico, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. The UPS Mobile App includes on-the-go access to UPS My Choice&#174;, which now has over 22 million members around the world. 

Supply Chain &#38; Freight Reporting Segment 

The Supply Chain &#38; Freight reporting segment consists of our forwarding and logistics services, truckload freight brokerage, UPS Freight and our financial offerings through UPS Capital. Supply chain complexity creates demand for a global service offering that incorporates transportation, distribution, and international trade and brokerage services, with complementary financial and information services. We meet this demand by offering a broad array of supply chain services in over 195 countries and territories. 

In 2015, we continued to invest in our global logistics network by adding an additional two million square feet of warehouse space in the United States, Canada and Western Europe. This follows our 2014 facility expansions in several key emerging markets including Brazil and China where the demand for outsourced value-added warehousing and logistics services continues to grow. 

Freight Forwarding 

We are one of the largest U.S. domestic air freight carriers and among the top international air freight forwarders globally. We offer a portfolio of guaranteed and non-guaranteed global air freight services. Additionally, as one of the world&#8217;s leading non-vessel operating common carriers, we also provide ocean freight full-container load, less-than-container load and multi-modal transportation services between most major ports around the world. 

Truckload Freight Brokerage (Coyote) 

In 2015, we acquired Coyote Logistics, a U.S.-based truckload freight brokerage company. The acquisition added large scale truckload freight brokerage and other transportation management services to our Supply Chain &#38; Freight reporting segment. In addition, we expect to benefit from synergies in purchased transportation, backhaul utilization, cross-selling to customers, as well as technology systems and industry best practices. 

Logistics and Distribution

In 2015, we launched UPS Mail Innovations Returns, an easy-to-use postal solution that combines the convenience of mailbox drop-off with the best-in-class speed, reliability and tracking of the UPS Mail Innovations network. Consumers can use their mailboxes to return lightweight parcels and the packages will flow through the UPS Mail Innovations network for delivery back to the shippers. UPS Mail Innovations Returns rounds out the industry-leading UPS Returns portfolio by giving consumers convenient postal access for returning lightweight shipments. 

&#8226; 

UPS Express Critical: UPS Express Critical provides a broad range of urgent global transportation options designed to complement UPS's core services and fill the gaps for late cut-offs, weekends and holidays. UPS Express Critical expanded its capabilities into Mexico in 2015. The initial time-critical service solutions offered for volume between the U.S. and Mexico as well as intra-Mexico are Next Flight Out, Charter, Hand Carry and Surface for lightweight to heavyweight shipments. 

UPS Freight 

UPS Freight offers regional, inter-regional and long-haul less-than-truckload ("LTL") services, as well as full truckload services, in all 50 states, Canada, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Mexico. UPS Freight provides reliable LTL service backed by a day-definite, on-time guarantee at no additional cost.

Customs Brokerage 

We are among the world&#8217;s largest customs brokers by both the number of shipments processed annually and by the number of dedicated brokerage employees worldwide. We provide our customers with customs clearance, trade management and international trade consulting services. 

UPS Capital

With the recent acquisitions of Parcel Pro and the Insured Parcel Services business of G4S International Logistics, UPS Capital now offers services and insurance coverage for the transport of high value luxury goods. 

Sustainability 

Our business and corporate responsibility strategies pursue a common interest to increase the vitality and environmental sustainability of the global economy by aggregating the shipping activity of millions of businesses and individuals worldwide into a single, highly efficient logistics network. This provides benefits to: 

&#8226; 

UPS, by ensuring strong demand for our services. 

&#8226; 

The economy, by enabling global commerce and making global supply chains more efficient and less expensive. 

&#8226;

Community 

We believe that strong communities are vital to the success of our company. By combining our philanthropy with the volunteer time and talents of our employees, we help drive positive change for organizations and communities in need across the globe. The highlights of our corporate citizenship efforts in 2015 &#32;include: 

&#8226; 

Local non-profits around the world received nearly 2.35 million hours of volunteer service from our employees participating in our Neighbor-to-Neighbor program. 

&#8226; 

The UPS Foundation, which oversees corporate citizenship efforts for the company, invested $111 million in donations of both cash and in-kind services to global causes primarily in four focus areas&#8212;community safety, environmental sustainability, diversity and volunteerism. 

&#8226; 

Our employees, both active and retired, contributed approximately $55 million to United Way which was matched by a corporate contribution of $8 million. 

&#8226; 

Through The UPS Foundation we have the opportunity to support our global communities to offset carbon, support clean water, reduce poverty and help individuals sustain their lives through the planting of trees. The UPS Global Forestry Initiative, which began in 2013, is the signature program of The UPS Foundation&#8217;s Environmental Focus area. By the end of 2015, we have supported the planting of five million trees worldwide. 

&#8226; 

We continued to aid communities impacted by disasters through our UPS Humanitarian Relief and Resilience program, by providing our logistics expertise, skilled volunteers, capacity building support and in-kind services. In 2015, we coordinated more than 350 humanitarian relief shipments across 50 countries and provided funding and logistics support to strengthen long-term recovery efforts of communities impacted by the Ebola Crisis, the Syrian Refugee Crisis and the Nepal Earthquake. 

&#8226; 

Nearly 6,700 teenagers and novice drivers in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Germany and China participated in UPS Road Code. This safety program for new drivers features our employees as instructors &#8211; a role where they share driving knowledge and safety tips amassed over our long history of safe driving. 

Reputation 

Great brands require connecting with customers, investors and other stakeholders with honesty and transparency. In working to develop these connections, we regularly receive high accolades from independent brand and reputation evaluations. 

In 2015 , we continued to be ranked highly by the following: 

&#8226; Forbes&#8217; 2015 ranking of America&#8217;s Most Reputable Companies, as rated by the Reputation Institute, 

&#8226; Interbrand&#8217;s Best Global Brands, 

&#8226; Millward Brown's BrandZ Most Valuable Global Brands and 

&#8226; Rittenhouse Rankings' annual &#32;CEO Candor and Culture Survey. 

Employees 

The strength of our company is our people, working together with a common purpose. We had approximately 444,000 &#32;employees (excluding temporary seasonal employees) as of December 31, 2015 , of which 362,000 &#32;are in the U.S. and 82,000 &#32;are located internationally. Our global workforce includes approximately 76,000 &#32;management employees (38% of whom are part-time) and 368,000 &#32;hourly employees (48% of whom are part-time). 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 266,000 &#32;employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (&#8220;Teamsters&#8221;). During 2014, the Teamsters ratified a new national master agreement with UPS that will expire on July 31, 2018. 

We have approximately 2,600 &#32;pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association ("IPA"), which became amendable at the end of 2011. The ongoing contract negotiations between UPS and the IPA are in mediation by the National Mediation Board. 

Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which became amendable November 1, 2013. In addition, approximately 3,100 &#32;of our auto and maintenance mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (&#8220;IAM&#8221;) that will expire on July 31, 2019. 

The experience of our management team continues to be an organizational strength. Nearly 34% of our full-time managers have more than 20 years of service with UPS. 

We believe that our relations with our employees are good. We periodically survey all our employees to determine their level of job satisfaction. Areas of concern receive management attention as we strive to keep UPS the employer-of-choice among our employees. We consistently receive numerous awards and wide recognition as an employer-of-choice, resulting in part from our emphasis on diversity and corporate citizenship. 

Safety 

Health, Wellness and Safety are core values at UPS and an enduring belief that the well-being of our people, business partners and the general public is of utmost importance. We train our people to recognize hazards, mitigate risk and avoid injury to themselves and others in all aspects of their work. We do not tolerate unsafe work practices. 

We recognize employees for health, wellness, and safety accomplishments. We provide programs to educate and promote the health and wellness of employees and their families and the safety of our operations. We are committed to fostering the most effective safety practices in our work environment. By meeting our high safety standards, we contribute to the well-being of our people, company and the communities we serve. 

We use an all-encompassing Comprehensive Health and Safety Process ("CHSP") to promote wellness and prevent occupational injuries, illnesses and auto crashes through the development of workplace programs. The foundation of this process is our co-chaired employee and management health and safety committees. Together they conduct facility and equipment audits, perform work practice and behavior analysis, conduct training and recommend work process and equipment changes. 

The components of CHSP are: 

&#8226; 

Personal Value. &#32;Which is the foundation and forms the base of our health, wellness and safety culture. 

&#8226; 

Management Commitment and Employee Involvement. &#32;Where employees take an active role in their own safety as well as their fellow workers and are supported by management. All operations management commit to providing a work environment that is conducive to the well-being and safety of our employees. 

&#8226; 

Work Site Analysis. &#32;Which includes injury and auto crash data analysis, behavior observations and facility and equipment audits to identify gaps and develop solutions. Our operations managers are responsible for their employees&#8217; safety results. We investigate every injury and auto crash and develop prevention activities. 

&#8226; 

Hazard Prevention and Control. &#32;Where solutions are developed and documented to ensure identified risks have been mitigated. 

&#8226; 

Safety Education and Training. &#32;Employees who are healthy and well-trained in proper methods are more safe and efficient in performing their jobs. Our approach starts with training the trainer. All trainers are certified to ensure that they have the skills and motivation to effectively instruct new employees. All new employees receive safety training during orientation and in the work area. In addition, each new driver receives extensive classroom and online instruction, as well as on-road training. 

Other components to ensure the safety of our people and fleet include: 

&#8226; 

Wellness. &#32;We have a "Five Being Habits" wellness program that turns health and wellness knowledge into actionable measures. These habits are designed to enable employees and their families to take positive steps toward healthy lifestyles. The "Five Being Habits" themes are: Fitness, Sleep, Hydration, Nutrition, and Stress Management. 

&#8226; 

Recognition. We have a well-defined safe driving honor plan to recognize our drivers when they achieve accident-free milestones. We have more than 7,800 drivers enshrined in our coveted Circle of Honor for drivers who have driven 25 years or more without an avoidable auto crash. 

&#8226; 

Preventive Maintenance. We &#32; have a comprehensive Preventive Maintenance Program to ensure the safety of our fleet. Our fleet is managed and monitored electronically to ensure that each vehicle is serviced at a specific time to prevent malfunction or breakdown. 

Competition 

UPS is a global leader in logistics. We offer a broad array of services in the package and freight delivery industry and, therefore, compete with many different local, regional, national and international carriers. Our competitors include worldwide postal services, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others, including startups that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. Through our supply chain service offerings, we compete with a number of providers in the supply chain, financial services and information technology industries. 

Competitive Strengths 

Our competitive strengths include: 

Global Network. We believe that our integrated global ground and air network is the most extensive in the industry. We provide all types of package service (air, ground, domestic, international, commercial and residential) through a single pickup and delivery service network. We also have extensive air freight, ocean freight, ground freight and logistics networks that provide additional capabilities in the global transportation and logistics market. 

Our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to optimize our network efficiency and asset utilization on a daily basis. This unique, integrated global business model creates consistent and superior returns. 

Global Presence. We serve more than 220 &#32;countries and territories around the world. We have a significant presence in all of the world&#8217;s major economies. 

Leading-edge Technology. We are a global leader in developing technology that helps our customers optimize their shipping and logistics business processes to lower costs, improve service and increase efficiency. 

Technology powers virtually every service we offer and every operation we perform. Our technology offerings are driven by our customers&#8217; needs. We offer a variety of online service options that enable our customers to integrate UPS functionality into their own businesses not only to send, manage and track their shipments conveniently, but also to provide their customers with better information services. We provide the infrastructure for an Internet presence that extends to tens of thousands of customers who have integrated UPS tools directly into their own websites. 

Broad Portfolio of Services. Our portfolio of services enables customers to choose the delivery option that is most appropriate for their requirements. Increasingly, our customers benefit from business solutions that integrate many UPS services in addition to package delivery. For example, our supply chain services&#8212;such as freight forwarding, customs brokerage, order fulfillment and returns management&#8212;help improve the efficiency of the supply chain management process. 

Customer Relationships. We focus on building and maintaining long-term customer relationships. We serve 1.6 million pickup customers and 8.4 million delivery customers daily. Cross-selling small package, supply chain and freight services across our customer base is an important growth mechanism for UPS. 

Brand Equity. We have built a leading and trusted brand that stands for quality service, reliability and service innovation. The distinctive appearance of our vehicles and the professional courtesy of our drivers are major contributors to our brand equity. 

Distinctive Culture. We believe that the dedication of our employees results in large part from our distinctive &#8220;employee-owner&#8221; concept. Our employee stock ownership tradition dates from 1927, when our founders, who believed that employee stock ownership was a vital foundation for successful business, first offered stock to employees. To encourage employee stock ownership, we maintain several stock-based compensation programs. 

Our long-standing policy of &#8220;promotion from within&#8221; complements our tradition of employee ownership, and this policy reduces the need for us to hire managers and executive officers from outside UPS. The majority of our management team began their careers as full-time or part-time hourly UPS employees, and have spent their entire careers with us. Many of our executive officers have more than 30 years of service with UPS and have accumulated a meaningful ownership stake in our company. Therefore, our executive officers have a strong incentive to effectively manage UPS, which benefits all of our shareowners. 

Financial Strength. Our balance sheet reflects financial strength that few companies can match. Our financial strength gives us the resources to achieve global scale; to invest in employee development, technology, transportation equipment and facilities; to pursue strategic opportunities that facilitate our growth; to service our obligations; and to return value to our shareowners in the form of dividends, share repurchases and steady share growth. 

Government Regulation 

We are subject to numerous laws and regulations in connection with our package and non-package businesses in the countries in which we operate. A summary of certain laws and regulations are described below. 

Air Operations 

The U.S. Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;), the Federal Aviation Administration (&#8220;FAA&#8221;), and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the Transportation Security Administration (&#8220;TSA&#8221;), have regulatory authority over United Parcel Service Co.&#8217;s (&#8220;UPS Airlines&#8217;&#8221;) air transportation services. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, is the statutory basis for DOT and FAA authority and the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, is the basis for TSA aviation security authority. 

The DOT&#8217;s authority primarily relates to economic aspects of air transportation, such as insurance requirements, discriminatory pricing, non-competitive practices, interlocking relations and cooperative agreements. The DOT also regulates, subject to the authority of the President of the United States, international routes, fares, rates and practices, and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. International operating rights for U.S. airlines are usually subject to bilateral agreement between the U.S. and foreign governments or, in the absence of such agreements, by principles of reciprocity. We are also subject to current and potential aviation regulations imposed by foreign governments in the countries in which we operate, including registration and license requirements and security regulations. UPS Airlines has international route operating rights granted by the DOT and we may apply for additional authorities when those operating rights are available and are required for the efficient operation of our international network. The efficiency and flexibility of our international air transportation network is dependent on DOT and foreign government regulations and operating restrictions. 

The FAA&#8217;s authority primarily relates to safety aspects of air transportation, including aircraft operating procedures, transportation of hazardous materials, record keeping standards and maintenance activities and personnel. In 1988, the FAA granted us an operating certificate, which remains in effect so long as we meet the safety and operational requirements of the applicable FAA regulations. In addition, we are subject to non-U.S. government regulation of aviation rights involving non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. customs regulation. 

UPS aircraft maintenance programs and procedures, including aircraft inspection and repair at periodic intervals, are approved for all aircraft under FAA regulations. The future cost of repairs pursuant to these programs may fluctuate according to aircraft condition, age and the enactment of additional FAA regulatory requirements. 

The TSA regulates various security aspects of air cargo transportation in a manner consistent with the TSA mission statement to &#8220;protect the Nation&#8217;s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce.&#8221; UPS Airlines, and specified airport and off-airport locations, are regulated under TSA regulations applicable to the transportation of cargo in an air network. In addition, personnel, facilities and procedures involved in air cargo transportation must comply with TSA regulations. 

UPS Airlines, along with a number of other domestic airlines, participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (&#8220;CRAF&#8221;) program. Our participation in the CRAF program allows the U.S. Department of Defense (&#8220;DOD&#8221;) to requisition specified UPS Airlines wide-body aircraft for military use during a national defense emergency. The DOD compensates us for the use of aircraft under the CRAF program. In addition, participation in CRAF entitles UPS Airlines to bid for military cargo charter operations. 

Ground Operations 

Our ground transportation of packages in the U.S. is subject to regulation by the DOT and its agency, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (the &#8220;FMCSA&#8221;) and the states&#8217; jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of operations, safety, insurance and hazardous materials. We also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the FMCSA, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours-of service. We are subject to similar regulation in many non-U.S. jurisdictions. 

The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 created the U.S. Postal Service as an independent establishment of the executive branch of the federal government, and created the Postal Rate Commission, an independent agency, to recommend postal rates. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 amended the 1970 Act to give the re-named Postal Regulatory Commission revised oversight authority over many aspects of the Postal Service, including postal rates, product offerings and service standards. We sometimes participate in the proceedings before the Postal Regulatory Commission in an attempt to secure fair postal rates for competitive services. 

Our ground operations are subject to compliance with various cargo-security and transportation regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, including regulation by the TSA. 

Customs 

We are subject to the customs laws in the countries in which we operate, regarding the import and export of shipments, including those related to the filing of documents on behalf of client importers and exporters. Our activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the TSA, the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission and the DOT. 

Environmental 

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations across all of our business units. These laws and regulations cover a variety of processes, including, but not limited to: proper storage, handling and disposal of waste materials; appropriately managing wastewater and stormwater; monitoring and maintaining the integrity of underground storage tanks; complying with laws regarding clean air, including those governing emissions; protecting against and appropriately responding to spills and releases; and communicating the presence of reportable quantities of hazardous materials to local responders. We have established site- and activity-specific environmental compliance and pollution prevention programs to address our environmental responsibilities and remain compliant. In addition, we have created numerous programs which seek to minimize waste and prevent pollution within our operations. 

Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the Environmental Protection Agency (the &#8220;EPA&#8221;), is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. Our aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. Our international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which we operate. 

Communications 

Because of our extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in our aircraft and ground transportation operations, we are subject to the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission regulates and licenses our activities pertaining to satellite communications.
