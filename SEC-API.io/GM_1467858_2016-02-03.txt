 Item 1. Business 

General Motors Company (sometimes referred to as we, our, us, ourselves, the Company, General Motors, or GM) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell cars, trucks, crossovers and automobile parts worldwide. We also provide automotive financing services through General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial). 

Automotive 

Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our four automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA), GM Europe (GME), GM International Operations (GMIO) and GM South America (GMSA). 

GMNA primarily meets the demands of customers in North America with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. The demands of customers outside North America are primarily met with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Holden, Opel and Vauxhall brands. We also have equity ownership stakes directly or indirectly in entities through various regional subsidiaries, primarily in Asia. These companies design, manufacture and market vehicles under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Jiefang and Wuling brands. 

In addition to the products we sell to our dealers for consumer retail sales, we also sell cars and trucks to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. We sell vehicles to fleet customers directly or through our network of dealers. Our retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of aftersale vehicle services and products through our dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties. 

Competitive Position 

The global automotive industry is highly competitive. The principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include overall vehicle design, price, quality, available options, safety, reliability, fuel economy and functionality. Market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely. 

Vehicle Sales 

We present both wholesale and retail vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and our market share. We do not currently export vehicles to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria. Accordingly these countries are excluded from industry sales data in the tables below and corresponding calculations of our market share. 

Wholesale Vehicle Sales 

Wholesale vehicle sales data, which represents sales directly to dealers and others, is the measure that correlates to our revenue from the sale of vehicles, which is the largest component of Automotive net sales and revenue. Wholesale vehicle sales exclude vehicles produced by joint ventures. We estimate our global breakeven point, excluding joint ventures selling automobiles in China (Automotive China JVs), to be approximately 4.5 million annual wholesale vehicle sales. In the year ended December 31, 2015 , 48.3% &#32;of our wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the U.S. The following table summarizes total wholesale vehicle sales of new vehicles by automotive segment (vehicles in thousands):

Retail Vehicle Sales 

&#32;1 

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Retail vehicle sales data, which represents sales to the end customers based upon the good faith estimates of management, including fleets, does not correlate directly to the revenue we recognize during the period. However retail vehicle sales data is indicative of the underlying demand for our vehicles. Market share information is based primarily on retail vehicle sales volume. In countries where retail vehicle sales data is not readily available other data sources, such as wholesale or forecast volumes, are used to estimate sales to the end customers. 

Retail vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on the percentage of ownership in the joint venture. Certain joint venture agreements in China allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of non-GM trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures. Retail vehicle sales data includes vehicles sold through the dealer registration channel (primarily in Europe). This sales channel consists primarily of dealer demonstrator, loaner and self-registered vehicles. These vehicles are not eligible to be sold as new vehicles after being registered by dealers. Certain fleet sales that are accounted for as operating leases are included in retail vehicle sales at the time of delivery to the daily rental car companies. The following table summarizes total industry retail sales, or estimated sales where retail sales volume is not available, of new vehicles and our related competitive position by geographic region (vehicles in thousands):

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 

__________ &#32; 

(a) 

Our China sales include the Automotive China JVs SAIC General Motors Sales Co., Ltd. (SGMS), SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co., Ltd. (SGMW) and FAW-GM Light Duty Commercial Vehicle Co., Ltd. (FAW-GM). End customer data is not readily available for the industry; therefore, wholesale volumes were used for Industry, GM and Market Share. Our retail sales in China were 3,613; 3,435 and 3,082 in the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

In the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;we estimate we had the largest market share in North America and South America, the number two market share in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region, which included the largest market share in China, and the number seven market share in Europe. In the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region was our largest region by retail vehicle sales volume and represented 45.4% &#32;of our global retail vehicle sales. 

Our retail vehicle sales volumes in the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;grew at a slightly slower pace than the overall industry, resulting in a 0.2 percentage point &#32;industry share decline. Our market share decreased due primarily to the change of our business model in Russia, our vehicle price increases in Brazil and our planned reduction of fleet sales in the U.S., (refer to the "Overview" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&#38;A) for detail), partially offset by our market share increase in China driven by strong performance of existing products and successful new launches including new sport utility vehicles &#32; (SUVs), Cadillac vehicles and multipurpose vehicles. Our retail vehicle sales volumes in the year ended December 31, 2014 &#32;grew at a slightly slower pace than the overall industry, resulting in a 0.1 percentage point &#32;industry share decline. Our market share decreased due primarily to the withdrawal of the Chevrolet brand from Europe and economic conditions and competitive environment in Brazil, partially offset by our market share increase in China driven by improved performance of existing products and successful launches of new vehicles. 

Fleet Sales and Deliveries 

The sales and market share data provided previously includes both retail and fleet vehicle sales. Certain fleet transactions, particularly daily rental, are generally less profitable than retail sales. A significant portion of the sales to daily rental car companies are recorded as operating leases under U.S. GAAP with no recognition of revenue at the date of initial delivery due to guaranteed repurchase obligations. The following table summarizes estimated fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total retail vehicle sales (vehicles in thousands):

Product Pricing 

&#32;3 

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Several methods are used to promote our products, including the use of dealer, retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support. The level of incentives is dependent in large part upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products. In 2016 &#32;we plan to continue to price vehicles competitively, including offering incentives as required. We believe this strategy, coupled with sound inventory management, will continue to strengthen the reputation of our brands. 

Cyclical Nature of Business 

Retail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month. Vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries. The market for vehicles depends on general economic conditions, credit availability and consumer spending. 

Relationship with Dealers 

We market vehicles worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers. These outlets include distributors, dealers and authorized sales, service and parts outlets. 

The following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships:

We and our joint ventures enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved location. Our dealers often offer more than one GM brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets in order to enhance dealer profitability. Authorized dealers offer parts, accessories, service and repairs for GM vehicles in the product lines that they sell using GM parts and accessories. Our dealers are authorized to service GM vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are to be made only with GM parts. Our dealers generally provide their customers access to credit or lease financing, vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by GM Financial and other financial institutions. 

The quality of GM dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success as dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products. In addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes, pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters. 

Research, Product and Business Development and Intellectual Property 

Costs for research, manufacturing engineering, product engineering and design and development activities relate primarily to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services including activities related to vehicle emissions control, improved fuel economy, the safety of drivers and passengers, urban mobility and autonomous vehicles. In the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;research and development expenses were $7.5 billion , $7.4 billion &#32;and $7.2 billion . 

Product Development 

The Product Development organization is responsible for designing and integrating vehicle and powertrain components to maximize part sharing across multiple vehicle segments. Global teams in Design, Program Management, Component &#38; Subsystem Engineering, Product Integrity, Powertrain and Purchasing &#38; Supply Chain collaborate to meet customer requirements and maximize global economies of scale. 

Our global vehicle architecture development has been consolidated and headquartered at our Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, to further the standardization of our overall vehicle development process. Cross-segment part sharing is an essential

enabler to our Vehicle Set Strategy, designed to reduce our overall number of global vehicle architectures to four major vehicle sets. As we implement the four vehicle sets, we will continue to leverage our current architecture portfolio to accommodate our customers around the world while achieving our financial goals. 

Hybrid, Plug-In, Extended Range and Battery Electric Vehicles 

We are investing significantly in multiple technologies offering increasing levels of vehicle electrification including eAssist, plug-in hybrid, full hybrid, extended range and battery electric vehicles. We currently offer five models in the U.S. featuring some form of electrification and continue to develop plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) technology and extended range electric vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt and Cadillac ELR. In 2015 we introduced the second-generation Chevrolet Volt. We also debuted the Chevrolet Bolt EV concept at the 2015 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan and the Cadillac CT6 PHEV at the 2015 Shanghai Auto Show. The Bolt EV will be an all-electric vehicle when it goes into production at our Orion Assembly plant in late 2016, providing more than 200 miles of range on a full charge. 

OnStar, LLC 

OnStar, LLC (OnStar) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GM serving more than 6.6 million subscribers in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, China (through a joint venture) and selected markets in Europe (launched in August 2015). OnStar is a provider of connected safety, security and mobility solutions and advanced information technology and is available on the majority of our 2016 model year vehicles. OnStar's key services include automatic crash response, stolen vehicle assistance, remote door unlock, turn-by-turn navigation, vehicle diagnostics, hands-free calling and 4G LTE wireless connectivity. 

OnStar has developed a system based on the findings of a Center for Disease Control and Prevention expert panel which allows OnStar advisors to alert first responders when a vehicle crash is likely to have caused serious injury to the occupants. OnStar also offers a mobile application to provide subscribers with up-to-date vehicle information such as oil level, tire pressure and fuel level as well as remote start, remote door lock and unlock and navigation services from a mobile phone. 

Car- and Ride-Sharing 

In January 2016 we announced the next step in our strategy to redefine personal mobility with a new car-sharing service called Maven, which combines our multiple car-sharing programs under a single brand and will expand its offerings to multiple cities and communities across the U.S. Maven gives customers access to highly personalized, on-demand mobility services. In January 2016 we purchased a 9% equity ownership interest in Lyft, Inc. (Lyft), a privately held company, for $0.5 billion, which we will leverage to expand our ride-sharing offerings. We also plan to develop with Lyft an integrated network of on-demand autonomous vehicles in the U.S. 

Autonomous Technology 

We see automation and autonomous technology leading to significant advances in convenience, mobility and safety, since more than 90% of crashes are caused by driver error. We have millions of miles of real-world experience with embedded connectivity through OnStar and advanced safety features that are the building blocks to more advanced automation features and eventually to fully autonomous vehicles. An example of an advanced automation is Super Cruise, a hands-free driving customer convenience feature that we expect to debut in 2017 on the Cadillac CT6 sedan. We are also working on autonomous systems and in 2016 plan to demonstrate the capabilities of a fleet of Chevrolet Volts on our 20,000-employee Global Technical Center campus. These vehicles will be ordered by a mobile phone application to go to the requested location and drive employees to their destination. 

Alternative Fuel Vehicles 

We believe alternative fuels offer significant potential to reduce petroleum consumption in the transportation sector. By leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop FlexFuel vehicles that can run on gasoline-ethanol blend fuels as well as vehicles that run on compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). 

We currently offer 12 FlexFuel vehicles in the U.S. for the 2016 model year to retail customers plus an additional seven models to fleet and commercial customers capable of operating on gasoline, E85 ethanol or any combination of the two. We continue to study the future role FlexFuel vehicles may play in the U.S. in light of recent regulatory developments and the rate of development 

&#32;5 

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 

of the refueling infrastructure. In Brazil a substantial majority of vehicles sold were FlexFuel vehicles capable of running on 100% ethanol blends. We also market FlexFuel vehicles in other global markets where biofuels have emerged in the marketplace. 

We produce CNG bi-fuel capable vehicles in Europe such as the Opel Zafira and in the U.S. with the Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana full-size vans (fleet and commercial customers) and the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2500 HD pick-up trucks (commercial and retail customers) that are capable of switching between gasoline or diesel and CNG. In addition we offer the CNG bi-fuel Chevrolet Impala full-size sedan to both fleet and retail markets in the U.S. We offer LPG capable vehicles globally in select markets reflecting the infrastructure, regulatory focus and natural resource availability of the markets in which they are sold. 

We support the development of biodiesel blend fuels, which are alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources, and we provide biodiesel capabilities in other markets reflecting the availability of biodiesel blend fuels. 

Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology 

As part of our long-term strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions we are committed to continuing development of our hydrogen fuel cell technology. Our Chevrolet Equinox fuel cell electric vehicle demonstration programs, such as Project Driveway, have accumulated more than 3 million miles of real-world driving by consumers, celebrities, business partners and government agencies. These programs are helping us identify consumer and infrastructure needs to understand the business case for potential production of vehicles with this technology. 

GM and Honda Motor Company entered into a long-term agreement to co-develop a next-generation fuel cell system and hydrogen storage technologies, aiming for the 2020 timeframe. The collaboration expects to succeed by sharing expertise, economies of scale and common sourcing strategies and builds upon GM's and Honda Motor Company's strengths as leaders in hydrogen fuel cell technology. 

Fuel Efficiency 

We are fully committed to improving fuel efficiency and meeting regulatory standards through a combination of strategies including: (1) extensive technology improvements to conventional powertrains; (2) increased use of smaller displacement engines and improved and advanced automatic transmissions; and (3) vehicle improvements including increased use of lighter, front-wheel drive architectures. 

Intellectual Property 

We generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business. While none of these patents are individually material to our business as a whole, these patents are very important to our operations and continued technological development. We hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace. 

Raw Materials, Services and Supplies 

We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts, supplies, energy, freight, transportation and other services from numerous suppliers for use in the manufacture of our products. The raw materials primarily include steel, aluminum, resins, copper, lead and platinum group metals. We have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements. 

In some instances, we purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. The inability or unwillingness of these sources to supply us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity. Combined purchases from our two largest suppliers have ranged from approximately 10% to 11% of our total purchases in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

Environmental and Regulatory Matters 

Automotive Emissions Control 

&#32;6 

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 

We are subject to laws and regulations that require us to control automotive emissions, including vehicle exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic (OBD) system requirements. Advanced OBD systems are used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems. Problems detected by the OBD system and in-use compliance monitoring may increase warranty costs and the likelihood of recall. Emission and OBD requirements become more stringent each year as vehicles must meet lower emission standards and new diagnostics are required throughout the world without harmonization of global regulations. Zero emission vehicle (ZEV) requirements have been adopted by some U.S. states and there is the possibility that additional jurisdictions could adopt ZEV requirements in the future. While we believe all our products are designed and manufactured in material compliance with vehicle emissions requirements, regulatory authorities may conduct ongoing evaluations of the emissions compliance of products from all manufacturers. This includes vehicle emissions testing, including CO 2 and nitrogen oxide emissions testing in Europe, and review of emission control strategies. 

U.S. and Canada 

The U.S. federal government imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the U.S. and additional requirements are imposed by various state governments. Canada&#8217;s federal government vehicle emission requirements are generally aligned with the U.S. federal requirements. Each model year we must obtain certification for each test group that our vehicles will meet emission requirements from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before we can sell vehicles in the U.S. and Canada and from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) before we can sell vehicles in California and other states that have adopted the California emissions requirements. 

CARB's latest emission requirements include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards including an increase in ZEVs offered by the same automaker such as electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. CARB has adopted 2018 model year and later requirements for increasing volumes of ZEVs to achieve greenhouse gas as well as criteria pollutant emission reductions to help achieve the state's long-term greenhouse gas reduction goals. The EPA has adopted similar exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards which phase in with the 2017 model year, but do not include ZEV requirements. These new requirements will also increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance. 

The Clean Air Act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt the California car and light-duty truck emission standards in lieu of the federal requirements. Thirteen states currently have these standards in effect and 10 of these 13 states have adopted the ZEV requirements. The Province of Quebec has also announced its intention to adopt a ZEV requirement. 

European Union &#32; 

Emissions are regulated by the European Commission (EC) and by governmental authorities in each European Union Member State (EU Member States). The EC imposes emission control requirements on vehicles sold in all 28 EU Member States. We must demonstrate that vehicles will meet emission requirements from an approval authority in one EU Member State before we can sell vehicles in any EU Member States. The regulatory requirements include random testing of newly assembled vehicles and a manufacturer in-use surveillance program. The European Union requirements are equivalent in terms of stringency and implementation to the framework of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. 

The existing level of exhaust emission standards for cars and light-duty trucks, Euro 6, was effective in 2014 for new vehicle approvals and 2015 for new vehicle registrations. Future European Union emission standards focus particularly on further reducing emissions from diesel vehicles by introducing new testing criteria based on &#8220;real world driving&#8221; emissions (RDE). RDE tests will become effective in 2017. The new requirements will require additional technologies and further increase the cost of diesel engines, which currently cost more than gasoline engines. To comply with RDE tests we expect that we will need to implement technologies identical to those already in production to meet U.S. emission standards. These technologies will put additional cost pressures on the already challenging European Union market for small and mid-size diesel vehicles. Gasoline engines are also affected by the new requirements. The measures for gasoline vehicles that require technology to reduce exhaust pollutant emissions will have adverse effects on vehicle fuel economy which drives additional technology cost to maintain fuel economy. 

In addition, increased scrutiny of compliance with emissions standards following the well-publicized emissions scandal involving an unrelated automotive manufacturer may result in changes to these standards, including the implementation of RDE tests, as well as stricter interpretations of these standards and more rigorous enforcement. This may lead to increased costs, penalties, negative publicity or reputation impact for us. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of these risks. 

&#32;7 

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 

In the long-term, we expect that the EC will continue devising regulatory requirements on the emission test cycle, real driving emission, low temperature testing, fuel evaporation and OBD. 

China 

China has implemented European type China 4 standards nationally with European OBD requirements for all newly registered vehicles. Cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou each currently require China 5 standards for newly registered vehicles. In total 11 eastern municipalities and provinces will require China 5 standards prior to nationwide implementation in 2017. The China 5 standards include more stringent emission requirements and increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance. China is considering a unique China 6 emission standard with the potential to combine elements of European and U.S. standards. Local implementation is expected as early as 2019. 

Automotive Fuel Economy 

U.S. and Canada 

Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) reporting is required for three separate fleets: domestically produced cars, imported cars and light-duty trucks. Both car and light-duty truck standards were established using targets for various vehicle sizes and vehicle model sales volumes. In 2016 our domestic car standard is estimated to be 36.2 mpg, our import car standard is estimated to be 40.0 mpg, and our light-duty truck standard is estimated to be 27.1 mpg. Our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal CAFE program through the 2016 model year. In addition to federal CAFE the EPA requires compliance with greenhouse gas requirements that are similar to the CAFE program. Our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal greenhouse gas program through the 2016 model year. CARB has agreed that compliance with the federal program is deemed to be compliant with the California program for the 2012 through 2016 model years. Although Canada has no parallel CAFE-style fuel economy regulations there are Canadian greenhouse gas regulations that are aligned with the U.S. EPA regulations and the Canadian fleets are expected to be compliant with the Canadian regulations through the 2016 model year. 

Europe 

The EU has implemented legislation regulating fleet average CO 2 &#32;emissions in Europe and has adopted an even more stringent fleet average CO 2 &#32;target for 2020. Requirements must be met through the introduction of CO 2 &#32;reducing technologies on conventional gasoline and diesel engines or through ultra-low CO 2 &#32;vehicles. We are developing a compliance plan by adopting operational CO 2 targets for each market entry in Europe. The EC will also devise regulatory requirements on the CO 2 emission test cycle as of 2017. 

China 

China has both an individual vehicle pass-fail type approval requirement based on Phase 2 standards and a fleet fuel consumption requirement based on Phase 3 standards based on vehicle curb weight for the 2012 through 2015 calendar years. Implementation began in 2012 with full compliance to 6.9L/100km required by 2015. China has continued subsidies for fuel efficient vehicles, plug-in hybrid, battery electric and fuel cell vehicles. China is now working on a more aggressive Phase 4 fleet fuel consumption standard that is expected to apply beginning in 2016 with full compliance to 5.0L/100km required by 2020. 

Industrial Environmental Control 

Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources. Refer to Note 15 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on environmental matters including site remediation. 

To mitigate the effects our worldwide operations have on the environment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with waste disposal, we are committed to converting as many of our worldwide operations as possible to landfill-free operations. At December 31, 2015, 90 (or approximately 50%) of our manufacturing operations were landfill-free. Additionally we have 41 non-manufacturing operations that are landfill-free. At our landfill-free manufacturing operations approximately 89% of waste materials are reused or recycled and 9% are converted to energy at waste-to-energy facilities. Including construction, demolition and remediation wastes, we estimate that we reused, recycled or composted over 2 million metric tons of waste materials at our global 

&#32;8 

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 

manufacturing operations, converted over 140,000 metric tons of waste materials to energy at waste-to-energy facilities and avoided approximately 9 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in the year ended December 31, 2015. 

In addition to minimizing our impact on the environment our landfill-free program and total waste reduction commitments generate revenue from the sale of production by-products, reduce our use of material, reduce our carbon footprint and help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste disposal. 

We continue to search for ways to increase our use of renewable energy and improve our energy efficiency. At December 31, 2015 we had implemented projects globally that had increased our total renewable energy capacity to over 105 megawatts. In 2015 we also met the EPA Energy Star Challenge for Industry (EPA Challenge) at seven of our sites globally &#32; by reducing energy intensity an average of 22% at these sites. To meet the EPA Challenge industrial sites must reduce energy intensity by 10% in five years or fewer. Three of the sites achieved the goal for the first time, bringing the total number of GM-owned sites to have met the EPA Challenge to 73, with many sites achieving the goal multiple times. These efforts minimize our utility expenses and are part of our approach to addressing climate change through setting a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, collecting accurate data, following our business plan and publicly reporting progress against our target. 

&#32; Chemical Regulations 

We continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business, suppliers and the automotive industry. 

U.S. and Canada 

Governmental agencies in both the U.S. and Canada continue to introduce new regulations and legislation related to the selection and use of chemicals or substances of concern by mandating broad prohibitions, green chemistry, life cycle analysis and product stewardship initiatives. These initiatives give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers' responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicle's life, as well as chemical selection for product development and manufacturing. Chemical restrictions in Canada are progressing more rapidly than in the U.S. as a result of Environment Canada&#8217;s Chemical Management Plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls on any chemical deemed toxic. These emerging regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity. We believe that we are materially in compliance with these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required date. 

The U.S. Congress is currently pursuing an update of the Toxic Substances Control Act to grant the EPA more authority to regulate and ban chemicals from use in the U.S. which, if passed, is expected to greatly increase the level of regulation of chemicals in vehicles. 

Europe 

In 2007 the EU implemented its regulatory requirements, the EU REACH regulation among others, to register, evaluate, authorize and restrict the use of chemical substances. This regulation requires chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the EU to be registered with the European Chemicals Agency before 2018. Under this regulation, &#8220;substances of very high concern&#8221; may either require authorization for further use or may be restricted in the future. This could potentially increase the cost of certain alternative substances that are used to manufacture vehicles and parts, or result in a supply chain disruption when a substance is no longer available to meet production timelines. Our research and development initiatives may be diverted to address future requirements. We believe that we are materially in compliance with these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required date. 

Safety 

In the U.S. the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 prohibits the sale of any new vehicle or equipment in the U.S. that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). If we or NHTSA determine that either a vehicle or vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or if a vehicle defect creates an unreasonable safety risk the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy. We are required to report certain information relating to certain customer complaints, warranty claims, field reports and notices and claims involving property damage, injuries and fatalities in the U.S. and claims involving fatalities outside the U.S. We are also required to report certain information concerning safety recalls and other safety campaigns outside the U.S. 

&#32;9 

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Outside the U.S. safety standards and recall regulations often have the same purpose as the U.S. standards but may differ in their requirements and test procedures, adding complexity to regulatory compliance. Refer to Note 11 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on significant recall activities in 2014. 

Automotive Financing - GM Financial 

GM Financial is our global captive automotive finance company and our global provider of automobile finance solutions. GM Financial conducts its business in North America, Europe, South America and, as a result of the 2015 acquisition of Ally Financial, Inc.'s (Ally Financial) equity interest in SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited (SAIC-GMAC), in China. 

GM Financial provides retail lending, both loan and lease, across the credit spectrum. Additionally GM Financial offers commercial products to dealer customers that include new and used vehicle inventory financing, inventory insurance, working capital, capital improvement loans, and storage center financing. 

In North America GM Financial's retail automobile finance programs include prime and sub-prime lending and full credit spectrum leasing. The sub-prime lending program is primarily offered to consumers with FICO scores less than 620 who have limited access to automobile financing through banks and credit unions and is expected to sustain a higher level of credit losses than prime lending. The leasing product is offered through our franchised dealers and primarily targets prime consumers leasing new vehicles. GM Financial is expanding its leasing, near prime and prime lending programs through our franchised dealers and anticipates that leasing and prime lending will become an increasing percentage of originations and the retail portfolio balance over time. 

Internationally GM Financial&#8217;s retail automobile finance programs focus on prime quality financing through loan and lease products. 

GM Financial seeks to fund its operations in each country through local sources of funding to minimize currency and country risk. GM Financial primarily finances its loan, lease and commercial origination volume through the use of secured and unsecured credit facilities, through securitization transactions where such markets are developed and through the issuance of unsecured debt. In the three months ended September 30, 2015 GM Financial began accepting deposits from retail banking customers in Germany. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 &#32;we employed 130,000 &#32;( 61% ) hourly employees and 85,000 &#32;( 39% ) salaried employees. At December 31, 2015 &#32; 52,000 &#32;( 54% ) of our U.S. employees were represented by unions, a majority of which were represented by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agriculture Implement Workers of America (UAW).
