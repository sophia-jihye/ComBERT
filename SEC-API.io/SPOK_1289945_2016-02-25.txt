Scope 

We are a provider of paging services and selected software solutions in the United States and abroad, generally in Europe, Canada, Australia, Asia and the Middle East. Our foreign sales represent less than 4% of consolidated revenue. We offer our services and products primarily to three major market segments: healthcare, government, and large enterprise, but with a greater emphasis on the healthcare market segment. For the year ended December 31, 2015, wireless and software revenue represent approximately 63% and 37%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. 

Industry Overview 

We deliver smart, reliable critical communication solutions to help protect the health, well-being, and safety of people around the globe. Organizations worldwide rely on Sp&#333;k for workflow improvement, secure texting, paging services, contact center optimization, and public safety response. 

We develop, sell, and support enterprise-wide systems for healthcare, government, large enterprise, and other organizations needing to automate, centralize, and standardize their approach to critical communications. Our solutions can be found in prominent hospitals; large government agencies; leading public safety institutions, colleges and universities; large hotels, resorts and casinos; and well-known manufacturers. 

Due to the focused nature of our software solutions there is no single competitor that matches our portfolio (see &#8220;Competition&#8221; below). Our primary market has been the healthcare industry, particularly hospitals. We have identified hospitals with 200 or more beds as the primary targets for our software solutions. Within this market we have identified the following dynamics and have focused our efforts (see &#8220;Products&#8221; and &#8220;Operations&#8221; below) to address these dynamics: 

&#8226; 

a heightened awareness of the ubiquitous, critical role of communications in healthcare; 

&#8226; 

an increased focus within hospitals on quality of care and patient safety initiatives; 

&#8226; 

the importance of confidentiality when sharing information; 

&#8226; 

increased regulations that may result in process changes, increased documentation and reporting and increased costs; 

&#8226; 

a continuing focus within hospitals to reduce labor and administrative costs while increasing productivity; and 

&#8226; 

a broader proliferation of information technology in healthcare as hospitals strive to apply technology to solve their business problems. 

Products 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Paging Services. We offer subscriptions to one-way or two-way messaging services for a periodic (monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual) service fee. The level of service fees is generally based upon the type of service provided, the geographic area covered, the number of devices provided to the customer and the period of commitment. A subscriber to one-way messaging services may select coverage on a local, regional, or nationwide basis to best meet their messaging needs. Two-way messaging is generally offered on a nationwide basis. In addition, subscribers either contract for a messaging device from us for an additional fixed monthly fee or they own a device, having purchased it either from us or from another vendor. We also sell devices to resellers who lease or resell them to their subscribers and then sell messaging services utilizing our networks. We offer ancillary services, such as voicemail and equipment loss or maintenance protection, which help increase the monthly recurring revenue we receive along with these traditional messaging services. During 2015 we launched a new exclusive secure alphanumeric pager which supports AES encryption, screen locking and remote wipe capabilities. This new one-way secure paging device enhances our service offerings to the healthcare community by adding HIPAA security capabilities to the low cost, highly reliable and availability benefits of paging. 

The demand for one-way and two-way messaging services declined during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and we believe demand will continue to decline for the foreseeable future. As demand for one-way and two-way messaging has declined, we have developed or added service offerings in order to increase our revenue potential and mitigate the decline in our wireless revenues. We will continue to look for ways to innovate and provide customers the highest value possible. 

Software. Dependable critical communications are paramount for individuals in healthcare, public safety, and a host of other industries. We offer a number of solutions, providing our customers with the ability to communicate anywhere, anytime across a number of situations. Our solutions are used for contact centers, clinical alerting and notification, mobile communications and messaging, and for public safety notifications. We offer critical communication solutions in four major product categories:

Sp&#333;k&#174; pc/psap: &#32;Speeds emergency dispatch by giving Public Safety Answering Point ("PSAP") call-takers an easy-to-use, standards-based, graphical interface that integrates the underlying phone system, mapping systems, and other resources for critical information availability. 9-1-1 call-takers are able to instantly involve police, fire, EMT, and hazardous material personnel with a single click of the mouse or touch of the screen. 

&#8226; 

Sp&#333;k&#174; Enterprise Alert: &#32;Directs emergency personnel to a 9-1-1 caller&#8217;s exact location (building, floor, room), helping to ensure speed, accuracy, and reliability of response. The E9-1-1 software provides real-time, onsite notification when 9-1-1 is dialed, and works to decrease emergency response time. 

Operations 

The following details critical elements of our operations that support both our wireless and software revenue. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Sales and Marketing 

Marketing . We have a centralized marketing function, which is focused on supporting our solutions and sales efforts by strengthening our corporate brand, generating sales leads, and facilitating the sales process. Our principal marketing programs include: 

&#8226; 

Content marketing (eBriefs, case studies, brochures, videos, infographics, and more) as an underlying foundation of all marketing campaigns or initiatives; 

&#8226; 

Website development and maintenance, which provides product and Company information, customer support options, paging capabilities, as well as thought leadership and engagement; 

&#8226; 

Participation at trade shows and industry events, such as Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, National Emergency Number Association, College of Healthcare Information Management Executives and Radiological Society of North America; 

&#8226; 

Webinars about current industry trends and our solutions; 

&#8226; 

Social media involvement to provide information regarding upcoming educational events or new product offerings; 

&#8226; 

Industry analyst relationships; 

&#8226; 

Newsletters and blog posts to provide information about industry trends and our solutions to customers, prospects, and alliances; and 

&#8226; 

Annual customer conferences that solicit feedback on our solutions and services. 

Sales. &#32;We have organized our global sales organization into two primary theaters: the Americas and International. We market and distribute our critical communication solutions through a direct sales force and an indirect sales channel. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;Americas. &#32;The direct sales force contracts or sells products, solutions, messaging services and other services directly to customers ranging from small and medium-sized businesses to companies in the Fortune 1000; healthcare and related businesses; and federal, state, and local government agencies. Though we will continue to market to commercial enterprises, especially healthcare organizations, interested in our communication solutions, we continue to grow our presence in the government sector. We maintain a sales presence in key markets throughout the United States in an effort to gain new customers and to retain and increase sales to existing customers. We also maintain several corporate sales groups, such as our Key Account Management team, focused on retaining and selling additional products and services to our key healthcare accounts as well as a team selling to government and national accounts. The direct sales force targets leadership responsible for the procurement of critical communications solutions such as chief information officers, chief technology officers, chief medical officers, chief nursing officers, information technology directors, telecommunications directors, and contact center managers. Additionally, for some of our software solutions, we target clinical leadership including chief medical officers and chief nursing officers. The timing for a direct sale varies, but may take from six to 18 months depending on the type of software solution. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;The indirect sales force complements our direct sales force. Through relationships with alliance partners we are able to sell our solutions to a wider customer base.. For paging services, we contract with and invoice an intermediary for airtime services. For our software sales, our relationships with alliance partners assist us in broadening the distribution of our products and further diversifying into markets outside healthcare. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;International. &#32;The international sales strategy is primarily focused on the healthcare market segment. We believe that the challenges within the healthcare industry are a global phenomenon. Worldwide, hospitals and healthcare practices are concentrated on patient safety, clinical workflow issues, privacy, efficiency, and better patient outcomes. We continue to pursue an international sales strategy and are expanding distribution of our core products into Australia and selected Asian, Pacific Rim, European and Middle Eastern markets. Although we continue to grow our presence internationally, to date our international sales represent less than 4% of our consolidated revenue, but remain a focus for future growth. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Professional Services and Customer Support 

Professional Services . We offer implementation services for our products. These implementation services are provided by a dedicated group of professional service employees. For software products, our professional services staff uses a branded, consistent methodology that provides a comprehensive phased work plan for both new software installations and/or upgrades. In support of our implementation methodology, we manage the various aspects of the process through a professional services automation tool. A typical implementation process ranges from 30 to 180 days depending on the type of implementation. We may also use third-party professional services firms to implement our solutions for customers depending on the circumstances. 

Customer Support. &#32;In order to support our products that provide mission critical solutions to our customer&#8217;s organizations, we have a dedicated customer support organization. The customer support organization provides support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year and the service can be accessed via telephone, email or the Internet via the Spok webpage. The Spok support service is augmented by third party services where needed. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Licenses and Messaging Networks 

In order to provide our wireless services, we hold licenses to operate on various frequencies in the 150 MHz and 900 MHz narrowband. We are licensed by the United States Federal Communications Commission (the &#8220;FCC&#8221;) to operate Commercial Mobile Radio Services (&#8220;CMRS&#8221;). These licenses are required to provide one-way and two-way messaging services over our networks. 

We operate local, regional and nationwide one-way networks, which enable subscribers to receive messages over a desired geographic area. One-way networks operating in 900 MHz frequency bands utilize the FLEX&#8482; protocol developed by Motorola Mobility, Inc. (&#8220;Motorola&#8221;). The FLEX&#8482; protocol has advantages of functioning at higher network speeds (which increases the volume of messages that can be transmitted over the network) and of having more robust error correction (which facilitates message delivery to a device with fewer transmission errors). 

Our two-way networks utilize the ReFLEX 25&#8482; protocol, also developed by Motorola. ReFLEX 25&#8482; promotes spectrum efficiency and high network capacity by dividing coverage areas into zones and sub-zones. Messages are directed to the zone or sub-zone where the subscriber is located, allowing the same frequency to be reused to carry different traffic in other zones or sub-zones. As a result, the ReFLEX 25&#8482; protocol allows the two-way network to transmit substantially more messages than a one-way network using the FLEX&#8482; protocols. The two-way network also provides for assured message delivery. The network stores messages that could not be delivered to a device that is out of coverage for any reason, and when the unit returns to service, those messages are delivered. The two-way paging network operates under a set of licenses called narrowband Personal Communications Service, which uses 900 MHz frequencies. These licenses require certain minimum five and ten-year build-out commitments established by the FCC, which have been satisfied. 

Although the capacities of our networks vary by geographic area, we have a significant amount of excess capacity. We have implemented a plan to manage network capacity and to improve overall network efficiency by consolidating subscribers onto fewer, higher capacity networks with increased transmission speeds. This plan is referred to as network rationalization. Network rationalization will result in fewer networks and therefore fewer transmitter locations, which we believe will result in lower operating expenses due primarily to lower site rent expenses. 

Generally, our software solutions do not require licenses or permits from Federal, state and/or local government agencies in order to be sold to customers. However, certain of our software products are subject to regulation by the FDA and are subject to certification by the Joint Interoperability Test Command to be sold to the branches of the armed services and the United States government. (See &#8220;Regulation&#8221; below). 

Our messaging networks and related infrastructure are located exclusively in the United States. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Customers 

Our customers include businesses and employees who need to be accessible to their offices or customers, first responders who need to be accessible in emergencies, and third parties, such as other telecommunication carriers and resellers that pay our Company to use our networks. Customers include businesses, professionals, management personnel, medical personnel, field sales personnel and service forces, members of the construction industry and construction trades, real estate brokers and developers, sales and services organizations, specialty trade organizations, manufacturing organizations and government agencies. 

We offer our communication services and products in the United States and abroad primarily to three major market segments: healthcare, government and large enterprise, but with a greater emphasis on the healthcare market segment. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, revenues from healthcare customers accounted for approximately 68.2%, 66.0% and 65.8% of our total revenues, respectively. No single customer accounted for more than 5% of our total revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

We pursue close, long-term relationships with our customers because we believe strong customer relationships enable us to retain our current customer base and expand our services and revenue to that customer base. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Product Development 

We maintain a product development group, which is focused on developing new software products along with ongoing maintenance and enhancement of existing products. Our product development group uses a methodology that balances enhancement requests from a number of sources including customers, regulatory requirements, the professional services staff, customer support incidents, known defects, market and technology trends, and competitive requirements. These requests are reviewed and prioritized based on criteria that include the potential for increased revenue, customer/employee satisfaction, possible cost savings and development time and expense. We have focused our product development activities on developing an integrated portfolio of critical communication solutions that focuses on four key areas of customer need: mobility offerings, an integrated platform, alerting and nursing solutions. The development of this integrated platform will require a multi-year effort by the product development staff. 

Our expenses for research and development for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $10.3 million, $9.5 million, and $8.7 million, respectively. (See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Sources of Equipment 

We do not manufacture the messaging devices our customers need to take advantage of our services or the network equipment we use to provide messaging services. We have relationships with several vendors to purchase new messaging devices. Used messaging devices are available in the secondary market from various sources. We believe existing inventory, returns of devices from customers that canceled services, and purchases from other available sources of new and reconditioned devices will be sufficient to meet expected messaging device requirements for the foreseeable future. We negotiate contractual terms with our vendors that do not directly relate to the manufacturing of the network equipment or messaging devices. The network equipment and messaging devices are generic on which we may place our logo or label. 

We sell third party equipment for use with the software. The third party equipment that we sell is generally available and does not require any specialty manufacturing to accommodate our software solutions. 

We currently have inventory and network equipment on hand that we believe will be sufficient to meet our wireless and software equipment requirements for the foreseeable future. 

Competition 

The competitors and degree of competition vary among the various products that we offer. Competition is particularly strong for our wireless messaging services. Within the wireless industry, companies compete on the basis of price, coverage area, services offered, transmission quality, network reliability, and customer service. We compete by maintaining competitive pricing for our products and services, by providing broad coverage options through high-quality, reliable messaging networks and by providing quality customer service. Direct competitors for wireless messaging services include American Messaging Service, LLC and a variety of other regional and local providers. We also compete with a broad array of wireless messaging services provided by mobile telephone companies, including AT&#38;T Mobility LLC, Sprint Nextel Corporation, T-Mobile USA, Inc., and Verizon Wireless, Inc. This competition has intensified as prices for the services of mobile telephone companies have declined and as those companies have incorporated messaging capabilities into their mobile phone devices. Many of these companies possess greater financial, technical and other resources than we do. 

Most Personal Communications Service and other mobile phone devices currently sold in the United States are capable of sending and receiving one-way and two-way messages. Most subscribers that purchase these services no longer need to subscribe to a separate messaging service. As a result, many one-way and two-way messaging subscribers can readily switch to cellular, Personal Communications Service and other mobile telephone services. The decrease in prices and increase in capacity and functionality for cellular, Personal Communications Service, WiFi, and other mobile telephone services have led many subscribers to select combined voice and messaging services from mobile telephone companies as an alternative to stand-alone messaging services. 

We also have a number of competitors whose software products compete with one or more modules of our critical communications solutions. These competitors are mostly privately held companies and offer a number of call center, alerting and communication products. Our primary competitive advantages include having: 

&#8226; 

An integrated product suite 

&#8226; 

A communication-driven workflow 

&#8226; 

Certifications, such as those through the Joint Interoperability Test Command (See "Joint Interoperability Test Command" below) and the FDA; and 

&#8226; 

A complete directory of contacts throughout the customer enterprise. 

Although there are no competitors that offer a similar comprehensive set of software modules that match our product offerings, there are several competitors who offer software similar to certain of our solutions. Selected competitors for portions of our product portfolio include: 

&#8226; Amtel Communications, Inc. (AMTELCO) - Contact center solutions; 

&#8226; Nuance Communications, Inc. - Clinical alerting solutions; 

&#8226; peerVue, Inc. - Clinical alerting solutions; 

&#8226; TigerText, Inc. - Mobile communication solutions; 

&#8226; Vocera Communications, Inc. - Mobile communications solutions; 

&#8226; Imprivata, Inc. - Mobile communications solutions; and 

&#8226; Voalte, Inc. - Mobile communications solutions. 

Regulation 

Federal Regulation 

&#32;The FCC issues licenses to use radio frequencies necessary to conduct our business and regulate many aspects of the operations that support our wireless revenue. Licenses granted to us by the FCC have varying terms, generally of up to ten years, at which time the FCC must approve renewal applications. In the past, FCC renewal applications generally have been granted upon showing compliance with FCC regulations and adequate service to the public. Other than those still pending, the FCC has thus far granted each license renewal that we have requested. 

The Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Communications Act&#8221;), requires radio licensees, including us, to obtain prior approval from the FCC for the assignment or transfer of control of any construction permit or station license or authorization of any rights thereunder. The FCC has thus far granted each assignment or transfer request we have made in connection with a change of control. 

The Communications Act also places limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licenses, which constitute the majority of our licenses. These foreign ownership restrictions limit the percentage of stockholders&#8217; equity that may be owned or voted, directly or indirectly, by non-United States citizens or their representatives, foreign governments or their representatives, or foreign corporations. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation permits the redemption of our equity from stockholders where necessary to ensure compliance with these requirements. 

The FCC&#8217;s rules and regulations require us to pay a variety of fees that otherwise increase our costs of doing business. For example, the FCC requires licensees, including SP&#332;K, to pay levies and fees, such as universal service fees, to cover the costs of certain regulatory programs and to promote various other societal goals. These requirements increase the cost of the services provided. By law, we are permitted to bill our customers for these regulatory costs and we typically do so. 

Additionally, the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act of 1994, (&#8220;CALEA&#8221;) and certain rules implementing CALEA require some telecommunication companies, including SP&#332;K, to design and/or modify their equipment in order to allow law enforcement personnel to &#8220;wiretap&#8221; or otherwise intercept messages. Other regulatory requirements restrict how we may use customer information and prohibit certain commercial electronic messages, even to our own customers. 

In addition, the FCC&#8217;s rules require us to pay other carriers for the transport and termination of some telecommunication traffic. As a result of various FCC decisions over the last few years, we no longer pay fees for the termination of traffic originating on the networks of local exchange carriers providing wireline services interconnected with our services. In some instances, we received refunds for prior payments to certain local exchange carriers. We have entered into a number of interconnection agreements with local exchange carriers in order to resolve various issues regarding charges imposed by local exchange carriers for interconnection. 

Failure to follow the FCC&#8217;s rules and regulations can result in a variety of penalties, ranging from monetary fines to the loss of licenses. Additionally, the FCC has the authority to modify licenses, or impose additional requirements through changes to its rules. 

The FDA has determined software systems that connect to medical devices are subject to regulation as medical devices as defined by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;the FDC Act&#8221;). Since our middleware software products connect to medical devices, we are required to comply with the FDC Act&#8217;s requirements, including but not limited to: registration and listing, labeling, medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events), removal and correction, and good manufacturing practice requirements. We have complied with the regulatory requirements of the FDC Act, and registered and received the necessary clearances for our products. As we modify and/or enhance our software products (including our middleware product), we may be required to request FDA clearance before we are permitted to market these products. 

In addition, our software products may handle or have access to personal health information subject in the United States to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;), and related regulations. These statutes and related regulations impose numerous requirements regarding the use and disclosure of personal health information with which we help our customers comply. Our failure to accurately anticipate or interpret these complex and technical laws could subject us to civil and/or criminal liability. We believe that we are in compliance with these laws and their related regulations. 

Although these and other regulatory requirements have not, to date, had a material adverse effect on our operating results, such requirements could have a material impact on our operating results in the future. We monitor discussions at the FCC and FDA on pending changes in regulatory policy or regulations; however, we are unable to predict what changes, if any, may occur in 2016 to regulatory policy or regulations. 

State Regulation 

As a result of the enactment by the United States Congress of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (&#8220;OBRA&#8221;) in August 1993, states are now generally preempted from exercising rate or entry regulation over any of our operations. States are not preempted, however, from regulating &#8220;other terms and conditions&#8221; of our operations, including consumer protection and similar rules of general applicability. Zoning requirements are also generally permissible, however, provisions of the OBRA prohibit local zoning authorities from unreasonably restricting wireless services. States that regulate our services also may require us to obtain prior approval of (1) the acquisition of controlling interests in other paging companies and (2) a change of control. 

At this time, we are not aware of any proposed state legislation or regulations that would have a material adverse impact on our business. 

Joint Interoperability Test Command ("JITC") Certification 

JITC is a military organization that tests technology for use by the branches of the armed services and the United States federal government. JITC certification is required of all systems with joint interfaces or joint information exchanges with other systems used by these organizations and is done to ensure all systems operate effectively together. All information technology and national security systems that exchange and use information to enable units or forces to operate effectively in joint, combined, coalition and interagency operations and simulations must be certified. Once a system has been certified under this program, the certification must be renewed every four years or after any changes that may affect interoperability. The interoperability certification process consists of four basic steps, which are: 

&#8226; 

Identify (interoperability) requirements; 

&#8226; 

Develop certification approach (planning); 

&#8226; 

Perform interoperability test and evaluation; and 

&#8226; 

Report certifications and statuses. 

SP&#332;K submits and receives JITC certification for certain of its products through the Defense Information Systems Agency ("DISC"), which allows us to sell and implement our solutions at Federal government agencies. SP&#332;K currently certifies a console, web, speech, mass notification, public safety answering point, call recording and campus 911 product with JITC. SP&#332;K has a roadmap to renew the existing certifications with new releases of existing products and to bring additional products to JITC to increase the products that can be sold into Federal agencies.

We have also owned the trademark &#8220;Amcom&#8221; in the United States since April 9, 2002 and in Australia since August 28, 2009 and the trademark &#8220;Amcom Software, Inc.&#8221; in the United States since April 8, 2009 and in Australia since August 28, 2009.

2016 Business Strategy 

During 2016, we will continue to execute on our vision of becoming a provider of integrated communications and collaboration enterprise solutions. In doing so, we will strengthen our core product offerings and offer new solutions as we continue to focus on serving the mission critical needs of our customers, while operating an efficient and profitable business strategy. In 2014, we integrated our wireless and software operations into one company and changed our name from USA Mobility, Inc. to Sp&#333;k Holdings, Inc. Our new brand reflected our position as a global critical communications provider. In 2015, we achieved many of our 2015 objectives as we: 1) grew total software revenue by 4.0%, 2) retained wireless subscribers and maintained significantly lower erosion than projected, 3) returned over $28.3 million to our stockholders and 4) strengthened our investment in product development. 

&#32;&#32;In furtherance of our 2016 business strategy, we have established the following operating objectives and priorities for 2016: 

&#8226; 

Grow our software revenue and bookings; 

&#8226; 

Retain our wireless subscribers and revenue stream; 

&#8226; 

Invest in our future solutions; 

&#8226; 

Return capital to our shareholders; and 

&#8226; 

Seek long-term revenue growth through business diversification. 

Grow our software revenue and bookings &#32;&#8212; We expect to continue our investment in sales and marketing, product implementation, product development and customer support to drive software, services and maintenance bookings and revenue growth. Healthcare customers represent our most stable and loyal customers and represented approximately 68% of our revenue base in 2015. We will continue to focus our sales and marketing efforts in the healthcare market in order to identify opportunities for sales and close those opportunities in the form of purchase orders or bookings. We have established software operations bookings as a key performance objective for our consolidated operations in 2016. 

We have an ongoing initiative to further penetrate the hospital segment in the United States and believe there is a significant opportunity to sell critical communication solutions to hospitals located outside the United States. We intend to leverage the strength of our market presence and the breadth of our product offerings to further expand our customer base in healthcare, but also in the government and large enterprise segments both in the United States and overseas particularly in the Asia Pacific region and in Europe and the Middle East. 

We must address the challenge of effectively managing our operating expenses to support our revenue and bookings growth without allowing costs to erode our profitability objectives. We have established operating cash flow ("OCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a key performance objective for our consolidated operations that focuses management on achieving operating efficiencies. We define OCF as operating income plus depreciation, amortization, accretion and impairment expenses (also known as &#8220;EBITDA&#8221;) less capital expenditures. (See Item 7. Non-GAAP Financial Measures.) 

Retain our wireless subscribers and revenue stream &#32;&#8212; Wireless subscribers and the resulting revenue represented about 63%, 66% and 71% of our total consolidated revenue for each of the three years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We will continue to focus on reducing the rate of subscriber disconnects and minimize the rate of wireless revenue erosion. We continue to have a valuable wireless presence in the healthcare market, particularly in larger hospitals. We offer a comprehensive suite of wireless messaging products and services focused on healthcare and &#8220;campus&#8221; type environments and critical mission notification. We will also focus on network reliability and customer service to help minimize the rate of subscriber disconnects. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;We recognize that our wireless subscribers and revenue will continue to decline. We will also continue to reduce our underlying cost structure impacting this wireless revenue stream. These cost reductions will come from all impacted areas. We will reduce payroll and related expenses as well as network related expenses as necessary in light of the declining wireless revenue. We will integrate and consolidate operations as necessary to ensure the lowest cost operational platform for our consolidated business. We have established a total consolidated revenue objective for our operations that will focus management on both our software and wireless revenue targets. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;Invest in our future solutions &#32;&#8212; The market for communication and collaboration solutions is expected to grow as healthcare continues to change. Trends including the establishment of accountable care organizations, reimbursement changes and emphasis on quality improvement and care coordination are all driving an evolution in communication and collaboration between previously disparate departments and systems within and outside hospitals. Becoming the leader in healthcare communication and collaboration will require us to develop an integrated platform and invest in the key areas of customer need including: 1) mobility, 2) integrated platform, 3) nursing solutions and 4) alerting. We plan on increasing our focus and investment in product development and strategy in 2016 and beyond to develop these solutions and compete in the changing marketplace. 

Return capital to our stockholders &#32;&#8212; We understand that our primary objective is to create long-term stockholder value. Executing our 2016 objectives is important, and we will continue to evaluate how best to deploy our capital resources to support sustainable business growth and maximize stockholder value. We expect to continue to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock or $0.50 annually. Also, we may repurchase more shares of our common stock from time to time under our existing stock repurchase program that expires on December 31, 2016. The repurchase authority under this program was reset to $10.0 million as of October 28, 2015 and was established to begin at the earlier of January 4, 2016 or the completion of the prior program. (See Item 5. Common Stock Repurchase program) . 

&#32;&#32;Seek long-term revenue growth through business diversification &#32;&#8212; We believe that add-on acquisitions of companies or technologies could be an important part of our future growth. We believe add-on acquisitions of complementary companies or technologies in the healthcare market could enhance our position with current customers and expand our overall addressable markets. Rapidly and successfully integrating strategic acquisitions and improving operational efficiencies would be a focus of our management team. Given the nature of our solutions, new technologies can be integrated to accelerate cross-selling opportunities. We evaluate these potential businesses or technologies to determine if they can be acquired at a reasonable valuation and will be profitably accretive and accelerate our revenue goals. 

&#32;To ensure focus on our 2016 business strategy we have established specific performance objectives in our short-term incentive plan (&#8220;STIP&#8221;) for our management that include these operating objectives and priorities. In addition, our long-term incentive plan (&#8220;LTIP&#8221;) includes specific performance objectives for these priorities.
