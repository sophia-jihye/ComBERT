 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160; 

Organization 

East West is a bank holding company incorporated in Delaware on August 26, 1998 and registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHCA&#8221;). The Company commenced business on December 30, 1998 when, pursuant to a reorganization, it acquired all of the voting stock of East West Bank, or the &#8220;Bank.&#8221; The Bank is the Company&#8217;s principal asset. In addition to the Bank, East West has six other subsidiaries established as statutory business trusts (the &#8220;Trusts&#8221;) as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and one subsidiary - East West Insurance Services, Inc. (the &#8220;Agency&#8221;) that provides business and consumer insurance services. The Trusts were set up for the purpose of issuing junior subordinated debt to third party investors. 

East West&#8217;s principal business is to serve as a holding company for the Bank and other banking or banking-related subsidiaries which East West may establish or acquire. As a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, East West&#8217;s principal source of funds is, and will continue to be, dividends that may be paid by its subsidiaries. East West&#8217;s other sources of funds include proceeds from the issuance of its common stock in connection with stock option and employee stock purchase plans. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had $32.35 billion &#32;in total assets, $23.41 billion &#32;in total loans (net of allowance), $27.48 billion &#32;in total deposits and $3.12 billion &#32;in stockholders&#8217; equity. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Bank has three wholly owned subsidiaries. The first subsidiary, E-W Services, Inc., is a California corporation organized by the Bank in 1977. E-W Services, Inc. holds properties used by the Bank in its operations. The second subsidiary, East-West Investments, Inc., primarily acts as a trustee in connection with real estate secured loans. The remaining subsidiary is East West Bank (China) Limited. 

On November 6, 2009, the Bank acquired United Commercial Bank (&#8220;UCB&#8221;), a California state-chartered bank headquartered in San Francisco, California. Under the terms of the UCB Purchase and Assumption Agreement, the Bank acquired certain assets of UCB with a fair value of approximately $9.86 billion and assumed liabilities with a fair value of approximately $9.57 billion. On June 11, 2010, the Bank acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Washington First International Bank (&#8220;WFIB&#8221;), a Washington state-chartered bank headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Under the terms of the WFIB Purchase and Assumption Agreement, the Bank acquired certain assets of WFIB with a fair value of approximately $492.6 million and liabilities with a fair value of approximately $481.3 million were assumed. Both of these transactions were FDIC-assisted acquisitions. On January 17, 2014, the Bank completed the acquisition of MetroCorp Bancshares, Inc., (&#8220;MetroCorp&#8221;) parent of MetroBank, N.A. and Metro United Bank. MetroCorp, headquartered in Houston, Texas, operated 19 &#32;branch locations within Texas and California under its two &#32;banks. The Bank acquired MetroCorp to further expand its presence, primarily in Texas within the markets of Houston and Dallas, and in California within the San Diego market. Approximately $1.70 billion of assets were acquired and $1.41 billion of liabilities were assumed. 

The Bank continues to develop its international banking capabilities. The Bank&#8217;s presence includes five &#32;full-service branches in Greater China, located in Hong Kong , two &#32;in Shanghai &#32;including one &#32;in the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone, Shantou &#32;and Shenzhen . The Bank also has five &#32;representative offices in Greater China located in Beijing , Chongqing , Guangzhou , Taipei , and Xiamen . In addition to facilitating traditional letters of credit and trade finance to businesses, these representative offices allow the Bank to assist existing clients, as well as develop new business relationships. Through these offices, the Bank is focused on growing its export-import lending volume by aiding U.S. exporters in identifying and developing new sales opportunities to China-based customers, as well as capturing additional letters of credit business generated from China-based exporters through broader correspondent banking relationships. 

The Bank continues to explore opportunities to establish other foreign offices, subsidiaries or strategic investments and partnerships to expand its international banking capabilities and to capitalize on the growing international trade business between the United States and Greater China. 

Banking Services 

As of December 31, 2015 , East West Bank was the fourth largest independent commercial bank headquartered in California based on total assets. East West Bank is the largest bank in the United States that focuses on the financial services needs of individuals and businesses which operate both in the United States and Greater China, as well as having a strong focus on the Chinese American community. Through its network of banking locations in the United States and Greater China, the Bank provides a wide range of personal and commercial banking services to small and medium-sized businesses, business executives, professionals, and other individuals. The Bank offers multilingual services to its customers in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, Vietnamese and Spanish. The Bank also offers a variety of deposit products which includes the traditional range of personal and business checking and savings accounts, time deposits and individual retirement accounts, travelers&#8217; checks, safe deposit boxes, and MasterCard &#174; &#32;and Visa &#174; &#32;merchant deposit services. The Bank&#8217;s lending activities include commercial and residential real estate, construction, trade finance, and commercial business, including accounts receivable, small business administration, inventory and working capital loans. The Bank generally provides commercial business loans to small and medium-sized businesses. The Bank&#8217;s commercial borrowers are engaged in a wide variety of manufacturing, wholesale trade and service businesses. In addition, the Bank is focused on providing financing to clients needing a financial bridge that facilitates their business transactions between the United States and Greater China. 

The Bank&#8217;s three &#32;operating segments: Retail Banking, Commercial Banking and Other are based on the Bank&#8217;s core strategy. The Retail Banking segment focuses primarily on retail operations through the Bank&#8217;s branch network. The Commercial Banking segment primarily generates commercial and industrial loans, and commercial real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) loans through the domestic commercial lending offices located in California, New York, Texas, Washington, Massachusetts, Nevada and Georgia, and through the foreign commercial lending offices located in China and Hong Kong. Furthermore, the Commercial Banking segment also offers a wide variety of international finance and trade services and products. The remaining centralized functions, including the treasury operations of the Company and eliminations of intersegment amounts have been aggregated and included in &#8220;Other.&#8221; For complete discussion and disclosure, please see the information in Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#32; (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) &#8212; &#32; Operating Segment Results and Note 20 &#32; &#8212; Business Segments &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Market Area and Competition 

The banking and financial services industry in California generally, and in the Bank&#8217;s market areas specifically, is highly competitive. The increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in laws and regulations, changes in technology and product delivery systems, as well as continuing consolidation among financial services providers. The Bank competes for loans, deposits, and customers with other commercial banks, other financial services institutions and other companies that offer banking services. Some of these competitors are larger in total assets and capitalization and offer a broader range of financial services than the Bank. 

The Bank concentrates on marketing its services in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area and the greater San Francisco Bay area as Greater China and other Pacific Rim countries continue to grow as California&#8217;s top trading partners. This provides the Bank with an important competitive advantage to its customers participating in the Asia Pacific marketplace. The Bank believes that its customers benefit from the Bank&#8217;s understanding of Asian markets through its physical presence in Greater China, the Bank&#8217;s corporate and organizational ties throughout Asia, as well as the Bank&#8217;s international banking products and services. The Bank believes that this approach, combined with the extensive ties of the Bank&#8217;s management and Board of Directors (the &#8220; Board&#8221;) to growing Asian business opportunities, as well as the Chinese-American communities, provides the Bank with an advantage in competing for customers in the Bank&#8217;s market area. 

Supervision and Regulation 

General 

East West and the Bank are extensively regulated under both federal and state laws. Regulation and supervision by the federal and state banking agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) administered by the FDIC and not for the protection of our stockholders. As a bank holding company, East West is subject to primary inspection, supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. The Bank, as a California state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, is subject to primary supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, as well as the California Department of Business Oversight (&#8220;DBO&#8221;) - Division of Financial Institutions. The Company is also subject to regulation by certain foreign regulatory agencies where we conduct business. 

The Company is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Exchange Act as administered by the SEC. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (&#8220;NASDAQ&#8221;) under the trading symbol &#8220;EWBC&#8221; and is subject to NASDAQ rules for listed companies. The Company is also subject to the accounting oversight and corporate governance of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

Described below are material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to East West and the Bank. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described. A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s business. 

East West &#160; 

East West is subject to regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHCA and its authority to, among other things: 

&#8226; 

require periodic reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require; 

&#8226; 

require the Company to maintain certain levels of capital and, under the Dodd-Frank Act, limit the ability of bank holding companies to pay dividends or bonuses unless their capital levels exceed the capital conservation buffer (please see Item 1. Business &#8212; Supervision and Regulation &#8212; Capital Requirements ); 

&#8226; 

require bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to subsidiary banks and commit resources, as necessary, to support each subsidiary bank. A bank holding company&#8217;s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of Federal Reserve regulations or both; 

&#8226; 

restrict the receipt and the payment of dividends; 

&#8226; 

terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries, affiliates or investments if the Federal Reserve believes that the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary; 

&#8226; 

regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt, including the authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt and require prior approval to purchase or redeem the Company&#8217;s securities in certain situations; 

&#8226; 

require the prior approval of senior executive officer or director changes and prohibit golden parachute payments, including change in control agreements, or new employment agreements with such payment terms, which are contingent upon termination; 

&#8226; 

approve acquisitions and mergers with banks and consider certain competitive, management, financial and other factors in granting these approvals. DBO approvals may also be required for certain mergers and acquisitions. 

As a bank holding company within the meaning of the California Financial Code, East West is subject to examination by, and may be required to file reports with the DBO. 

The Bank and its subsidiaries 

East West Bank is a California state-chartered bank, a member and stockholder of the Federal Reserve and a member of the FDIC. T he Bank is subject to primary supervision, periodic examination, and regulation by the CFPB, DBO, and the Federal Reserve, as the Bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator. The Federal Reserve and the DBO also regulate the Bank&#8217;s foreign operations. These operations are subject to the supervisory authorities of the host countries in which the Bank&#8217;s overseas offices reside. Specific federal and state laws and regulations which are applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, and the nature and amount of collateral for certain loans. The regulatory structure also gives the bank regulatory agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies. California law permits state chartered commercial banks to engage in any activity permissible for national banks, unless such activity is expressly prohibited by state law. Therefore, the Bank may form subsidiaries to engage in the many so-called &#8220;closely related to banking&#8221; or &#8220;nonbanking&#8221; activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries, and further, pursuant to the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, the Bank may conduct certain &#8220;financial&#8221; activities in a subsidiary to the same extent permitted for a national bank, provided the Bank is and remains &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;well-managed&#8221; and in satisfactory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;). 

Regulation of Subsidiaries/Branches 

Foreign-based subsidiaries, including East West Bank China (Limited), are subject to applicable foreign laws and regulations, such as those implemented by the China Banking Regulatory Commission. Nonbank subsidiaries are subject to additional or separate regulation and supervision by other state, federal and self-regulatory bodies. The Agency is subject to the licensing and supervisory authority of the California Department of Insurance. The East West Hong Kong branch is subject to applicable foreign laws and regulations, such as those implemented by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. 

Dodd-Frank Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in July 2010, comprehensively reformed the regulation of financial institutions and their products and services. The Dodd-Frank Act also significantly revised and expanded the rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority of the federal bank regulatory agencies. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB to be responsible for consumer protection in the financial services industry; provided for new capital standards that eliminate the treatment of trust preferred securities as Tier 1 regulatory capital; required that deposit insurance assessments be calculated based on an insured depository institution&#8217;s assets rather than its insured deposits; raised the minimum Designated Reserve Ratio to 1.35%; established a comprehensive regulatory regime for the derivatives activities of financial institutions; established new compensation restrictions and standards regarding the time, manner and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation; prohibited banking entities, after a transition period, from engaging in certain types of proprietary trading, as well as having investments in, sponsoring, and maintaining certain types of relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds (through provisions commonly referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221;); placed limitations on the interchange fees charged for debit card transactions; and established new minimum mortgage underwriting standards for residential mortgages. 

The Dodd-Frank Act impacts many aspects of the financial industry and will impact larger and smaller financial institutions and community banks differently over time. Many of the key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act affecting the financial industry are either in effect or are in the proposed rules or implementation stages. 

CFPB Supervision 

The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the CFPB, and giving it responsibility for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws. Depository institutions with assets exceeding $10 billion (such as the Bank), their affiliates, and certain non-banks in the markets for consumer financial services (as determined by the CFPB) are subject to direct supervision by the CFPB, including any applicable examination, enforcement and reporting requirements the CFPB may establish. The CFPB is focused on: 

&#8226; 

risks to consumers and compliance with the Federal consumer financial laws, when it evaluates the policies and practices of a financial institution; 

&#8226; 

unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts on practices, which the Dodd-Frank Act empowers the agency to prevent through rulemaking, enforcement and examination; 

&#8226; 

rulemaking to implement various federal consumer statutes such as the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Electronic Fund Transfer Act; 

&#8226; 

the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets; and 

&#8226; 

with respect to the indirect auto business, holding lenders accountable for discriminatory dealer markups. 

The statutes and regulations that the CFPB enforces mandate certain disclosure and other requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. In addition, the Department of Justice enforces the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which provides protection for military servicemembers and their family including a limitation on the ability to retake collateral in the event of default and a statutory interest rate cap for certain debts. Failure to comply with these laws can subject the Bank to various penalties, including, but not limited, to enforcement actions, injunctions, fines or criminal penalties, punitive damages or restitution to consumers, and the loss of certain contractual rights. The Bank and the Company are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition. 

Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) and Federal Reserve 

The Bank is a member of the FHLB of San Francisco. As an FHLB member, the Bank is required to own a certain amount of capital stock in the FHLB. The Bank may also access FHLB for both short-term and long-term secured borrowing sources. The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain interest-earning reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts. As of December 31, 2015 , the Bank was in compliance with these requirements. As a member bank, the Bank is also required to own capital stock in the Federal Reserve. 

Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds 

Dividends from the Bank constitute the principal source of income to East West. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends. In addition, the banking agencies have the authority to prohibit or limit the Bank from paying dividends, depending upon the Bank&#8217;s financial condition, if such payment is deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Furthermore, under the federal prompt corrective action (&#8220;PCA&#8221;) regulations, the Federal Reserve or FDIC may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company&#8217;s bank subsidiary is classified as &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; For more information, please see Capital Requirements &#32;below. 

It is the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past years and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization&#8217;s expected future needs and financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine the company&#8217;s ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. Additionally, in consideration of the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve has stated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels, unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in transactions with their affiliates, including their bank holding companies. Regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve limit the types and amounts of these transactions that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on an arm's length basis. In general, these regulations require that &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; between a subsidiary bank and its parent company or the nonbank subsidiaries of the bank holding company are limited to 10% of the bank subsidiary's capital and surplus and, with respect to such parent company and all such nonbank subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% of the bank subsidiary's capital and surplus. Further, these restrictions, contained in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation W, prevent East West and other affiliates from borrowing from, or entering into other credit transactions with, the Bank or its operating subsidiaries, unless the loans or other credit transactions are secured by specified amounts of collateral . Federal law also limits a bank's authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. The terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank's capital. The Dodd-Frank Act treats derivative transactions resulting in credit exposure to an affiliate as covered transactions. It expands the transactions for which collateral is required to be maintained, and for all such transactions, it requires collateral to be maintained at all times. In addition, the Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act establishes certain prohibitions, restrictions and requirements (known as &#8220;Super 23A&#8221; and &#8220;Super 23B&#8221;) on transactions between a covered fund and a banking entity that serves as an investment manager, investment adviser, organizer and offeror, or sponsor with respect to that covered fund, regardless of whether the banking entity has an ownership interest in the fund. 

Stress Testing for Banks with Assets of $10 Billion to $50 Billion 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires stress testing of bank holding companies and banks that have more than $10 billion but less than $50 billion of consolidated assets (&#8220;$10 - $50 billion companies&#8221;). Additional stress testing is required for banking organizations having $50 billion or more of assets. $10 - $50 billion companies, including the Company and the Bank, are required to conduct annual company-run stress tests under rules the federal bank regulatory agencies issued in October 2012. Stress tests assess the potential impact of scenarios on the consolidated earnings, balance sheet and capital of a bank holding company or bank over a designated planning horizon of nine quarters, taking into account the organization&#8217;s current condition, risks, exposures, strategies, activities and such factors as the regulators may request of a specific organization. Each banking organization&#8217;s Board and senior management are required to review and approve the policies and procedures of their stress testing processes as frequently as economic conditions or the condition of the organization may warrant, and at least annually. They are also required to consider the results of the stress test in the normal course of business, including the banking organization&#8217;s capital planning (including dividends and share buybacks), assessment of capital adequacy and maintaining capital consistent with its risks, and risk management practices. The results of the stress tests are provided to the applicable federal banking agencies. The final rule requirement for public disclosure of a summary of the stress testing results for the $10 - $50 billion companies has been implemented starting with the 2014 stress test, with the disclosure requirements effective in June 2015. 

CRA 

Under the CRA as implemented by FDIC regulations, an institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help serve the credit needs of its communities, including extending credit to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA requires public disclosure of the Bank&#8217;s CRA rating. Should the Bank fail to serve the community adequately, potential penalties may include regulatory denials of applications to expand branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, expand into new financial activities and merge with or purchase other financial institutions. 

FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments 

The FDIC insures the Bank&#8217;s customer deposits through the DIF of the FDIC up to prescribed limits for each depositor. The Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments as determined by the FDIC. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target DIF ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, such as the Bank are responsible for funding the increase. For additional information regarding deposit insurance, see Item 1A. Risk Factors . The FDIC may terminate a depository institution&#8217;s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution&#8217;s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of the bank&#8217;s depositors. The termination of deposit insurance for the Bank would also result in the revocation of the Bank&#8217;s charter by the DBO. 

Anti-Money Laundering (&#8220;AML&#8221;) and Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) Regulation 

A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The Bank Secrecy Act (&#8220;BSA&#8221;) and its implementing regulations and parallel requirements of the federal banking regulators require the Bank to maintain a risk-based AML program reasonably designed to prevent and detect money laundering and terrorist financing and to comply with the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the BSA, including the requirement to report suspicious activity. There is an expectation by the Bank&#8217;s regulators that there will be an effective governance structure for the program which includes effective oversight by our Board and management. The program must include, at a minimum, a designated compliance officer, written policies, procedures and internal controls, training of appropriate personnel and independent testing of the program, and a customer identification program. The United States Department of Treasury&#8217;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (&#8220;FinCEN&#8221;) and the federal banking agencies continue to issue regulations and guidance with respect to the application and requirements of the BSA and their expectations for effective AML programs. Banking regulators also examine banks for compliance with the economic sanctions regulations administered by the OFAC. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate BSA/AML and OFAC programs, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 

Capital Requirements 

The federal banking agencies have risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization&#8217;s operations both for transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and for transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements, that are recorded as off-balance sheet items. Prior to January 1, 2015, these guidelines were based upon the 1988 capital accord (&#8220;Basel I&#8221;) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;). In 2013, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued final rules (the &#8220;Basel III Capital Rules&#8221;) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The rules implement the Basel Committee&#8217;s December 2010 framework, commonly referred to as Basel III, for strengthening international capital standards, as well as implementing certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

&#160; 

The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including the Company and the Bank, compared to the previous U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015 (subject to phase-in periods for some of their components). The Basel III Capital Rules: (i) introduce a new capital measure called Common Equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) and a related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments, which are instruments treated as Tier 1 instruments under the prior capital rules that meet certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions or adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital, as compared to existing regulations. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of Tier 2 capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to the Basel III Capital Rules&#8217; specific requirements. 

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the following are the initial minimum capital ratios applicable to the Company and the Bank as of January 1, 2015: 

&#8226; 

4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 

&#8226; 

6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; 

&#8226; 

8.0% total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and 

&#8226; 

4.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio. 

The Basel III Capital Rules also introduce a new &#8220;capital conservation buffer,&#8221; composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and will be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). Thus, when fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, the Company and the Bank will be required to maintain this additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, resulting in the following minimum capital ratios: 

&#8226; 

4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, plus the capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%; 

&#8226; 

6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, plus the capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.5%; 

&#8226; 

8.0% total capital to risk-weighted assets, plus the capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of at least 10.5%; and 

&#8226; 

4.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio. 

The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that (i) mortgage servicing rights, (ii) deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and (iii) significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive income or loss items are not excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations (i.e., banking organizations with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets or with less than $10 billion of on-balance sheet foreign exposures), including the Company and the Bank, may make a one-time permanent election to exclude these items. This election must be made concurrently with the first filing of certain of the Company and the Bank&#8217;s periodic regulatory reports in the beginning of 2015. The Company and the Bank have made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of its available-for-sale securities portfolio. 

The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a new standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk weighting categories from the previous four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. Government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, depending on the nature of the assets. The new capital rules generally result in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes, including certain CRE mortgages. Additional aspects of the Basel III Capital Rules that are relevant to the Company and the Bank include: 

&#8226; 

consistent with the Basel I risk-based capital rules, assigning exposures secured by single family residential properties to either a 50% risk weight for first-lien mortgages that meet prudential underwriting standards or a 100% risk weight category for all other mortgages; 

&#8226; 

providing for a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (set at 0% under the Basel I risk based capital rules); 

&#8226; 

assigning a 150% risk weight to all exposures that are nonaccrual or 90 days or more past due (set at 100% under the Basel I risk-based capital rules), except for those secured by single family residential properties, which will be assigned a 100% risk weight, consistent with the Basel I risk-based capital rules; 

&#8226; 

applying a 150% risk weight instead of a 100% risk weight for certain high volatility CRE acquisition, development and construction loans; and 

&#8226; 

applying a 250% risk weight to the portion of mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks that are not deducted from CET1 capital (set at 100% under the Basel I risk-based capital rules). 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios exceeded the minimum capital adequacy guideline percentage requirements of the federal banking agencies for &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; institutions under the Basel III capital rules on a fully phased-in basis. For complete discussion and disclosure please see Item 7. MD&#38;A &#8212; Regulatory Capital and Ratios &#32;and Note 19 &#32;&#8212; Regulatory Requirements &#32; and Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

With respect to the Bank, the Basel III Capital Rules also revise the PCA regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as discussed below under &#8220;PCA.&#8221; 

PCA 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (&#8220;FDIA&#8221;), requires federal banking agencies to take PCA in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA includes the following five capital tiers: &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; A depository institution&#8217;s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The Basel III Capital Rules, as promulgated by the Federal Reserve, revised the PCA requirements effective January 1, 2015. Under the revised PCA provisions of the FDIA, an insured depository institution generally will be classified in the following categories based on the capital measures indicated:

An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios, if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank&#8217;s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying PCA regulations and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank&#8217;s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. 

The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company, if the depository institution would thereafter be &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; &#8220;Undercapitalized&#8221; institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is &#8220;significantly undercapitalized.&#8221; &#8220;Significantly undercapitalized&#8221; depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. &#8220;Critically undercapitalized&#8221; institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. 

Future Legislation and Regulation 

Considering the recent conditions in the global financial markets and economy, legislators, presidential candidates and regulators have continued to increase their focus on regulation of the financial services industry. Proposals to further increase regulation of the financial services industry have been and are expected to continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress, in state legislatures and abroad. In addition, not all regulations authorized or required under the Dodd-Frank Act have been proposed or finalized by federal regulators. Further legislative changes and additional regulations may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such legislation and regulations could increase the cost of conducting the Company&#8217;s business, affect the Company&#8217;s compensation structure and restrict or expand the activities in which the Company may engage among other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether future legislative proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect from implementing such regulations would have on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations or financial condition. The same uncertainty exists with respect to regulations authorized or required under the Dodd-Frank Act but that have not yet been proposed or finalized. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , the Company had approximately 2,833 employees. None of the Company&#8217;s employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements.
