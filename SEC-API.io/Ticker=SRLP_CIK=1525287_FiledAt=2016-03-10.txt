Our Partnership 

We are a Delaware limited partnership formed in June 2011 by Sprague Holdings and our General Partner to engage in the storage, distribution and sale of refined petroleum products and natural gas, as well as providing storage and handling services for a broad range of materials. 

We are one of the largest independent wholesale distributors of refined products in the Northeast United States based on aggregate terminal capacity. We own, operate and/or control a network of 19 &#32;refined products and materials handling terminals strategically located throughout the Northeast United States and in Quebec, Canada that have a combined storage capacity of 14.2 million barrels for refined products and other liquid materials, as well as 2.0 million &#32;square feet of materials handling capacity. We also have an aggregate of 2.0 million barrels of additional storage capacity attributable to 45 &#32;storage tanks not currently in service. These tanks are not necessary for the operation of our business at current levels. In the event that such additional capacity were desired, additional time and capital would be required to bring any of such storage tanks into service. Furthermore, we have access to approximately 60 &#32;third-party terminals in the Northeast United States through which we sell or distribute refined products pursuant to rack, exchange and throughput agreements. 

We operate under four business segments: refined products, natural gas, materials handling and other operations. We evaluate the performance of our segments using adjusted gross margin which is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management and external users of our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements to assess the economic results of operations. For a description of how we define adjusted gross margin see &#8220;Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA.&#8221; For a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to the GAAP measure most directly comparable thereto see &#8220;Results of Operations.&#8221; See &#8220;Segment Reporting&#8221; included under Note 16 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a presentation of financial results by reportable segment and see Item 7 - "Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation&#8212;Results of Operation&#8221; for a discussion of financial results by segment.

In our refined products segment we purchase a variety of refined products, such as heating oil, diesel fuel, residual fuel oil, kerosene, jet fuel, gasoline and asphalt (primarily from refining companies, trading organizations and producers), and sell them to our customers. We have wholesale customers who resell the refined products we sell to them and commercial customers who consume the refined products directly. Our wholesale customers consist of more than 1,100 home heating oil retailers and diesel fuel and gasoline resellers. Our commercial customers include federal and state agencies, municipalities, regional transit authorities, large industrial companies, real estate management companies, hospitals, educational institutions and asphalt paving companies. For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we sold 1.7 billion , 1.7 billion &#32;and 1.5 billion &#32;gallons of refined products, respectively. 

In our natural gas segment we purchase, sell and distribute natural gas to more than 14,000 &#32;commercial and industrial customer locations across 13 states in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States. We purchase the natural gas we sell from natural gas producers and trading companies. For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we sold 56.9 &#32;Bcf, 54.4 &#32;Bcf and 52.0 &#32;Bcf of natural gas, respectively. 

Our materials handling segment is a fee-based business and is generally conducted under multi-year agreements. We offload, store and/or prepare for delivery a variety of customer owned products, including asphalt, crude oil, clay slurry, salt, gypsum, coal, petroleum coke, caustic soda, tallow, pulp and heavy equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we offloaded, stored and/or prepared for delivery, 2.7 million short tons of products and 266.3 million gallons of liquid materials. For the years ended December 31, 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;we offloaded, stored and/or prepared for delivery 2.7 million and 2.1 million short tons of products, and 309.8 million and 246.7 million gallons of liquid materials, respectively. 

Our other operations segment includes the marketing and distribution of coal conducted in our Portland, Maine terminal, commercial trucking activity conducted by our Canadian subsidiary and the heating equipment service business acquired in connection with the Castle Oil (&#8220;Castle&#8221;) acquisition in December 2014. 

We take title to the products we sell in our refined products and natural gas segments. We do not take title to any of the products in our materials handling segment. In order to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations, we use derivatives and forward contracts to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between product purchases and product sales. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Parent, through its ownership of Sprague Holdings, owned 2,034,378 &#32;common units and 10,071,970 &#32;subordinated units, representing an aggregate of 57% &#32;of the limited partner interest in the Partnership. Sprague Holdings also owns the General Partner, which in turn owns a non-economic interest in the Partnership. Sprague Holdings currently holds incentive distribution rights (&#8220;IDRs&#8221;) which entitle it to receive increasing percentages, up to a maximum of 50.0%, of the cash the Partnership distributes from distributable cash flow in excess of $0.474375 per unit per quarter. The maximum IDR distribution of 50.0% does not include any distributions that Sprague Holdings may receive on any limited partner units that it owns. 

We make available through our website our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish such material to, the SEC. Our internet address is http://www.spragueenergy.com/investor-relations &#32;and the SEC's internet address at http://www.sec.gov . 

Recent Developments 

On February 1, 2016, we purchased the natural gas assets of Santa Buckley Energy, Inc. (&#8220;SBE&#8221;) for $17.5 million , not including the purchase of natural gas inventory, utility security deposits, and other adjustments. Total consideration at closing was $29.1 million . SBE markets natural gas to commercial, industrial and municipal consumers in the Northeast United States. The acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination and was financed with borrowings under our credit facility. 

On March 10, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our Credit Agreement to increase our acquisition facility from $400.0 million to $550.0 million. In addition, we executed an amendment to make modifications to borrowing base calculations which reflect our increased use of certain forward contracts and changes to accommodate payment patterns of customers in certain markets from our recent acquisitions. Other changes were made to reflect the new form of ownership of one of our Canadian subsidiaries, and a change to the Senior Secured Leverage covenant to allow for an increase in leverage for a period of time following material acquisitions. 

Acquisitions 

In December 2014, we completed the acquisition of all of the equity interests in Kildair Service Ltd. (&#8220;Kildair&#8221;) through the acquisition of the equity interests of Kildair&#8217;s parent, Sprague Canadian Properties LLC, for total consideration of $175.0 million, which included $10.0 million of our common units. Kildair owns a terminal in Sorel-Tracy, Quebec, on the St. Lawrence River where it maintains 3.3 million barrels of residual fuel, asphalt, and crude oil storage. Kildair&#8217;s primary businesses include marketing of residual fuel both locally and for export, marketing of asphalt including polymer modified grades, and crude-by-rail handling services. Kildair&#8217;s terminal has blending infrastructure allowing the ability to process a wide range of varying quality blend components. As this transaction represented a transfer of entities under common control, the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and related information presented herein have been recast to include the historical results of Kildair for all periods presented in which Kildair was controlled by Axel Johnson. 

In December 2014, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Castle Oil (&#8220;Castle&#8221;), including Castle&#8217;s Bronx terminal and its associated wholesale, commercial and retail fuel distribution business for $45.7 million in cash, an obligation to pay $5.0 million over a three year period (net present value of $4.6 million) and $5.3 million of our common units, plus payments for inventory and other current assets of $37.0 million. Castle&#8217;s Bronx terminal is a large deepwater petroleum products terminal located in New York City, with a total storage capacity of 907,000 barrels, handling distillates, residual fuel, asphalt and biodiesel. 

In October 2014, we purchased Metromedia Gas &#38; Power Inc.&#8217;s (&#8220;Metromedia Energy&#8221;) natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage business for $22.0 million, not including the purchase of natural gas inventory, utility security deposits, and other adjustments. Total consideration at closing was $32.8 million. Metromedia Energy marketed natural gas and brokered electricity to commercial, industrial and municipal consumers in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and was financed with borrowings under the Partnership&#8217;s credit facility. 

In July 2013, our Predecessor purchased an oil terminal in Bridgeport, Connecticut for $20.7 million. This deep water facility includes 13 storage tanks with 1.3 million barrels of storage capacity for gasoline and distillate products with 11 storage tanks and 1.1 million barrels currently in service. The terminal provides throughput services to third-parties for branded gasoline sales in the Connecticut market. 

Business Strategies 

Our plan is to increase distributable cash flow per unit by executing the following strategies: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Acquire additional terminals and marketing and distribution businesses that are accretive . We intend to grow our asset and customer base by acquiring additional marine and inland terminals (both refined products and materials handling) within and adjacent to the geographic markets we currently serve. We also intend to acquire additional refined products and natural gas marketing businesses that have demonstrated an ability to generate cash flow and that will enable us to leverage our existing investment in our business and customer service systems to further increase and stabilize our own cash flow. 

&#8226; 

Increase our business with existing customers. &#32;We intend to increase the net sales and margin we realize from customers we currently serve by expanding the range of products and services we provide and by developing additional ways to address our customers&#8217; needs for certainty of supply, reduced commodity price risk and high-quality customer service. 

&#8226; 

Limit our exposure to commodity price volatility and credit risk. &#32;We take title to the products we sell in our refined products and natural gas segments, while our materials handling business is operated predominantly under fixed-fee, multi-year contracts. We will continue to manage our exposure to commodity prices by seeking to maintain a balanced position in our purchases and sales through the use of derivatives and forward contracts. In addition to managing commodity price volatility, we will continue to manage our counterparty risk by maintaining a conservative credit management processes. 

&#8226; 

Maintain our operational excellence. &#32;We intend to maintain our long history of safe, cost-effective operations and environmental stewardship by applying new technologies, investing in the maintenance of our assets and providing training programs for our personnel. We have a Health, Safety and Environmental department primarily devoted to safety matters and reducing operational and environmental risks. We will work diligently to meet or exceed applicable safety and environmental regulations and we will continue to enhance our safety monitoring function as our business grows and operating conditions change. 

Refined Products 

Overview 

The products we sell in our refined products segment can be grouped into the following categories: distillates, gasoline and residual fuel oil and asphalt. In 2015 , our refined products segment accounted for 88% &#32;of our total net sales. Of our total volume sold in our refined products segment in 2015 , distillates accounted for 72% , gasoline accounted for 13% &#32;and residual fuel oil and asphalt accounted for 15% . 

Distillates . We sell four kinds of distillates: heating oil (both unbranded and our proprietary premium HeatForce &#174; heating oil brand), diesel fuel (both unbranded and our proprietary premium RoadForce &#174; diesel fuel brand), kerosene and jet fuel. In 2015 , heating oil accounted for 52% , diesel fuel accounted for 35% , and other distillates accounted for 13% &#32;of the total volume of distillates we sold. We have the capability at several of our facilities to blend biodiesel with distillates in order to sell heating oil and diesel fuel with wide varieties of biodiesel content. In 2015 , biofuel blends accounted for 14% &#32;of the distillate fuel volumes sold. Distillate volumes accounted for 72% , 67% , and 64% &#32;of our total refined products sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Gasoline . We also sell unbranded gasoline. Gasoline volumes accounted for 13% , 14% &#32;and 15% &#32;of our total refined products sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Residual Fuel Oil and Asphalt. &#32;We sell various sulfur grades of residual fuel oil, blended to meet customer requirements in our market areas. Residual fuel oil and asphalt volumes accounted for 15% , 19% &#32;and 21% &#32;of our total refined products sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Customers, Contracts and Pricing 

We sell heating oil, diesel fuel, kerosene, unbranded gasoline, jet fuel, residual fuel oil and asphalt to wholesalers, retailers and commercial customers. The majority of these sales are made free on board, or FOB, at the bulk terminal or inland storage facility we own and/or operate or at facilities with which we have storage and throughput arrangements. In a FOB sale, the price of products sold includes the cost of delivering such product to the FOB location and any further shipping expenses are borne by the purchaser. 

We sell heating oil, including HeatForce &#174; , to approximately 1,000 wholesale distributors and retailers. These sales are made through Sprague RealTime &#174; &#32;pricing platform, under rack agreements based upon our posted price, contracts with index-based pricing provisions, and fixed price forward contracts. 

We sell diesel fuel, including RoadForce &#174; &#32;premium diesel fuel, to approximately 625 &#32;wholesalers and transportation fuel distributors and unbranded gasoline at third-party locations, primarily to resellers. 

We sell residual fuel oil to more than 1,600 &#32;commercial and industrial accounts under rack agreements and contracts with index-based pricing provisions. 

We also sell heating oil, diesel fuel, unbranded gasoline and residual fuel oil to public sector entities through competitive bidding processes as well as distillate and residual fuel oil by truck and barge to marine customers. 

Our commercial customers include federal and state agencies, municipalities, regional transit authorities, large industrial companies, real estate management companies, and educational institutions. Most of these sales are made on a delivered basis, whereby we either deliver the product with our own trucks and barges or arrange with third-party haulers to make deliveries on our behalf. 

Our sales contracts to commercial customers generally are for terms of one to five years. We currently have contracts with the U.S. government as well as with numerous states, municipalities, agencies and educational institutions. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , no customer represented more than 10% of net sales for our refined products segment. 

Natural Gas 

Overview 

We sell natural gas and related delivery services to customers primarily located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , our natural gas segment accounted for 10% &#32;of our total net sales. We deliver natural gas to customers through utility interconnections of pipelines and manage interactions with utilities on behalf of our customers. We sell natural gas pursuant to fixed price, floating price and other structured pricing contracts. We utilize physical purchase instruments as well as financial and derivative instruments both over the counter and through exchanges such as the Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (&#8220;ICE&#8221;) and the New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX"), in order to manage our natural gas commodity price risk. 

In order to manage our supply commitments to our customers and provide operational flexibility and arbitrage opportunities, we enter into supply contracts, leases for pipeline transportation capacity, leases for storage space and other physical delivery services for various terms. We believe that entering into these types of arrangements provides us with potential opportunities to grow our existing customer relationships and to pursue additional relationships. 

Customers 

Our natural gas customers operate in the industrial and commercial sectors in the Northeast United States, with the highest concentration in New England and New York. We acquired the natural gas marketing business of Metromedia Energy &#32; in 2014 and SBE in 2016, as part of our strategy to target smaller to mid-size commercial and industrial customers. This strategy has led to a significant increase in the number of customers served. Examples of customers include industrial users of varying sizes (e.g., pulp and paper, chemicals, pharmaceutical and metals plants) to various commercial customers (e.g., hospitals, universities, apartment buildings and retail establishments). The industrial customers have a high concentration of process load to support their manufacturing requirements, with the largest uses by the commercial customers typically for heating, cooling, lighting, cooking and drying. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , no customer represented more than 10% of net sales for our natural gas segment. 

Contracts/Pricing 

We use various types of contracts for the sale and delivery of natural gas to our customers, with terms ranging from month-to-month to over two years. We provide a wide range of pricing options to our customers, including daily pricing and long-term fixed pricing. For example, we may offer a contract that permits the customer to lock in a basis or location differential relative to the Henry Hub delivery location and then fix the price at a later date based on the prevailing market pricing. There are various other alternatives such as &#8220;capped&#8221; pricing (essentially setting a maximum) or daily pricing based on a differential to a published market index. Due to the commodity price risk associated with uncertain customer usage patterns, we generally avoid transactions that require a single price for all volumes delivered, with the pricing of the non-contractual volumes based on prevailing market economics. 

Materials Handling 

Overview 

Materials handling consists of the movement of raw materials and finished goods through our waterfront terminals. We utilize our terminal network to offload, store and/or prepare for delivery a large number of liquid products, bulk and break bulk materials and provide heavy lift services and other handling services to many of the same customers that we supply with refined products. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , our materials handling segment accounted for 1% &#32;of our total net sales. 

We are capable of providing numerous types of materials handling services, including ship handling, crane operations, pile building, warehouse operations, scaling and, in some cases, transportation to the final customer. Because the products we handle are generally owned by our customers, we have virtually no working capital requirements, commercial risk or inventory risk. Our materials handling contracts are typically long-term and predominately fee-based. 

Major Types of Materials Handling and Services 

The type of materials handling and services we provide can be divided into three major categories: 

Liquid . Liquid products are moved to terminals via rail car and various types of ocean going vessels and offloaded into terminal tanks via pipelines on the dock of the facility. Examples of liquid materials handled include crude oil, refined products, asphalt and clay slurry. Liquid handling activities include securing the vessel, attaching product lines from ship pipes to dock product lines, supervising discharge into tanks, measuring tank quantities, storing product, loading product into authorized trucks or railcars and in some cases transporting the product. In some cases the products need to remain heated in storage to be able to flow at ambient temperatures. Kildair&#8217;s operations include a materials handling contract involving transloading and storage of crude oil. 

Bulk . Bulk materials are typically aggregate materials that are moved in large vessels configured with multiple holds that store products on ships with no packaging. Examples of bulk material include salt, petroleum coke, gypsum, and coal. These vessels are normally offloaded via cranes that either reside on the vessel or on the dock of the terminal. In a typical discharge the services performed include: securing the vessel to the dock, operating the vessel cranes, transferring products to trucks via large dock hoppers, transporting the materials to a holding pad, building materials up into large storage piles, covering the piles with protective tarps, storing the product, loading the product into trucks or railcars, scaling the loaded trucks and sometimes transporting the product to its final destination. 

Break bulk . Break bulk materials are shipped in less than bulk quantities normally with some type of secondary packaging. Examples of break bulk materials include one ton sacks of raw materials, pallets of stones, bales of raw wood pulp and rolls of paper. Another subcategory of break bulk materials is large construction project cargo such as windmill components, often referred to as heavy lift. Break bulk handling activities include securing vessels, unloading or loading vessels either with cranes or specialty fork trucks, transferring products into warehouses or onto pads for storage, reloading products onto trucks or railcars and sometimes transporting products to their final destinations. 

Customers 

Our materials handling operations can service multiple customer types during any single operation, including: ocean shippers, multiple logistics firms, trucking firms and the materials supplier or consumer. Materials we handle normally fall into three major categories. The first category involves raw materials or finished goods shipped by water into local markets to support local production, manufacturing or construction firms. Examples of these products include asphalt for road construction, gypsum rock for drywall manufacturing, road salt for local road treatment, petroleum coke or utility fuels for energy demand and clay slurry for finished paper treatment. The second category of materials we handle are materials manufactured locally for export via vessel to other countries. These materials include hardwood, wood pulp for paper manufacture in Asia or Europe and tallow for biodiesel production in Europe. The third category of materials we handle are both crude oil and refined products sourced either in Canada, U.S. or internationally for a range of use in local refineries and or for further export to the U.S. or elsewhere. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we had one customer who represented 21% &#32;of net sales for our materials handling segment, although no customer represented more than 1% of our total net sales. 

Contracts/Pricing 

The typical contract term for our materials handling services varies depending on the frequency and type of service. For bulk and liquid services, the commodity is normally a raw materials input for industrial production (wood pulp) or construction of roads (asphalt) or wallboard (gypsum rock). As such, the demand is more ratable and the customer is normally in need of guaranteed space within a terminal. These customers typically enter into term contracts that can range from one to 20 years depending on the relative importance of the material to their production and the amount of any capital infrastructure that we need to develop for such customers. As of December 31, 2015 , the weighted-average life of our materials handling contracts was nine years, with a weighted-average remaining term of three years, each based on adjusted gross margin as defined in Item 7 - "Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;How Management Evaluates Our Results of Operations&#8212;Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA.&#8221;, attributable to these contracts. Historically, our customers have paid for terminal improvements for specialty handling systems such as a clay slurry screening plant, while we will pay for more generic infrastructure improvements such as storage pads. 

For container and break bulk services, it is typical for the user of that material to contract on an individual shipment basis. For example, a typical pulp merchant may choose to sell its pulp domestically or to users in Europe or Asia depending on the highest delivered value it can yield. As such, its choice of delivery mode and terminal will be driven by the location of its final customer. Therefore, we normally maintain a published rate for most generic services, subject to change depending on market conditions. 

Other Operations 

Our other operations segment includes the marketing and distribution of coal that is conducted in our Portland, Maine terminal, commercial trucking activity in Kildair&#8217;s operations and the heating equipment service business acquired in connection with the Castle acquisition in 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , our other operations segment accounted for less than 1% &#32;of our total net sales. 

Commodity Risk Management 

Because we take title to the refined products and natural gas that we sell, we are exposed to commodity risk. Our materials handling business is a fee-based business and, accordingly, our operations in that business segment have only limited exposure to commodity risk. Commodity risk is the risk of market fluctuations in the price of commodities such as refined products and natural gas. We endeavor to limit commodity price risk in connection with our daily operations. Generally, as we purchase and/or store refined products, we reduce commodity risk through hedging by selling futures contracts on regulated exchanges or using other derivatives, and then close out the related hedge as we sell the product for physical delivery to third parties. Products are generally purchased and sold at spot prices, fixed prices or indexed prices. While we seek to use these transactions to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchased volumes and sales volumes through regulated exchanges or derivatives, we may experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time as a result of variances in daily sales and transportation and delivery schedules, as well as logistical issues associated with inclement weather conditions or infrastructure disruptions. Our general policy is to not hold refined products futures contracts or other derivative products and instruments for the sole purpose of speculating on price changes. While our policies are designed to limit market risk, some degree of exposure to unforeseen fluctuations in market conditions remains. 

Our operating results are sensitive to a number of commodity risk factors. Such factors include commodity location, grades of product, individual customer demand for grades or location of product, localized market price structures, availability of transportation facilities, daily delivery volumes that vary from expected quantities and timing and costs to deliver the commodity to the customer. The term &#8220;basis risk&#8221; is used to describe the inherent market price risk created when a commodity of certain grade or location is purchased, sold or exchanged as compared to a purchase, sale or exchange of that commodity at a different time or place, including, without limitation, transportation costs and timing differentials. We attempt to reduce our exposure to basis risk by grouping our purchase and sale activities by geographical region and commodity quality in order to stay balanced within such designated region. 

With respect to the pricing of commodities, we enter into derivative positions to limit or hedge the impact of market fluctuations on our purchase and forward fixed price sales of refined products. Any hedge ineffectiveness is reflected in our results of operations. 

With respect to refined products, we primarily use a combination of futures contracts, over-the-counter swaps and forward purchases and sales to hedge our price risk. For light oils (gasoline and distillates), we primarily utilize the actively traded futures contracts on the regulated NYMEX as the derivatives to hedge our positions. Heavy oils are typically hedged with fixed-for-floating price residual fuel oil swaps contracts, which are either balanced by offsetting positions or financially settled (meaning that these swaps do not include a delivery option). 

With respect to natural gas, we generally use fixed-for-floating price swaps contracts that trade on the ICE for hedging. As an alternative, we may use NYMEX natural gas futures for such purposes. In addition, we use natural gas basis swaps to hedge our basis risk. 

For both refined products and natural gas, if we trade in any derivatives that are not cleared on an exchange, we strive to enter into derivative agreements with counterparties that we believe have a strong credit profile and/or provide us with significant trade credit to limit counterparty risk and margin requirements. 

We monitor policies, processes and procedures designed to prevent unauthorized trading and to maintain substantial balance between purchases and sales or future delivery obligations. We can provide no assurance, however, that these steps will detect and/or prevent all violations of such risk management policies, processes and procedures, particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved. 

Storage and Distribution Services 

Marine terminals and inland storage facilities play a key role in the distribution of product to our customers. Our facilities are equipped to provide terminalling, storage and distribution of both solid and liquid products to serve our refined products and materials handling businesses. Each facility has capabilities that are unique to the local markets served. A majority of facilities additionally have demonstrated flexibility in their ability to handle liquid, dry bulk and break bulk products at the same terminal and in most cases across the same dock. This capability has offered us valuable flexibility to fully utilize each asset to meet a variety of fuel demands and third-party cargo handling demands as customer requirements have changed over the years. 

The marine terminals and inland storage facilities from which we distribute product are supplied by ship, barge, truck, pipeline or rail. The inland storage facilities, which we use exclusively to store distillates, are supplied with product delivered by truck from marine and other bulk terminals. Our customers receive product from our network of marine terminals and inland storage facilities via truck, barge, rail or pipeline. 

Our marine terminals consist of multiple storage tanks and automated truck loading equipment. These automated systems monitor terminal access, volumetric allocations, credit control and carrier certification through the identification of customers. In addition, some of the marine and inland terminals at which we market are equipped with truck loading racks capable of providing automated blending and additive packages that meet our customers&#8217; specific requirements. Many of our marine and inland terminals operate 24 hours per day. 

Throughput arrangements allow storage of product at terminals owned by others. These arrangements permit our customers to load product at third-party terminals while we pay the owners of these terminals fees for services rendered in connection with the receipt, storage and handling of such product. Payments we make to the terminal owners may be fixed or based upon the volume of product that is delivered and sold at the terminal. 

Exchange agreements allow our customers to take delivery of product at a terminal or facility that is not owned or leased by us. An exchange is a contractual agreement pursuant to which the parties exchange product at their respective terminals or facilities. For example, we (or our customers) receive product that is owned by the other party from such party&#8217;s facility or terminal and we deliver the same volume of product to such party (or to such party&#8217;s customers) out of one of the terminals in our terminal network. Generally, both parties to an exchange transaction pay a handling fee (similar to a throughput fee) and often one party also pays a location differential that covers any excess transportation costs incurred by the other party in supplying product to the location at which the first party receives product. Other differentials that may occur in exchanges (and result in additional payments) include product value differentials.

We own, operate, and/or control a network of 19 refined products and material handling terminals and storage facilities located along the coast of the Northeast United States from New York to Maine and in Quebec, Canada that have a combined storage capacity of 14.2 million barrels for refined products and other liquid materials, as well as 2.0 million &#32;square feet of materials handling capacity. We also have an aggregate of 2.0 million barrels of additional storage capacity attributable to 45 &#32;storage tanks not currently in service. These tanks are not necessary for the operation of our business at current levels. In the event that such additional capacity were desired, additional time and capital would be required to bring any of such storage tanks into service. Furthermore, we have access to approximately 60 &#32;third-party terminals in the Northeast United States through which we sell or distribute refined products pursuant to rack, exchange and throughput agreements. 

We operate or control ten terminals that are capable of handling both liquid petroleum products and providing third-party materials handling services. Five terminals handle liquid petroleum products exclusively and four terminals are dedicated to materials handling services. Inside warehouse capacity at our owned and/or operated terminals totaled 305,000 &#32;square feet with 1.6 million &#32;square feet of outside laydown space available.

Competition 

We encounter varying degrees of competition in the marketing of our refined products based on product type and geographic location. In our Northeast United States market, we compete in various product lines and for a range of customer types. The principal methods of competition in our refined products operations are pricing, service offerings to customers, credit support and certainty of supply. Our competitors include terminal companies, major integrated oil companies and their marketing affiliates and independent marketers of varying sizes, financial resources and experience. We believe that our being one of the largest independent wholesale distributors of refined products in the Northeast United States (based on aggregate terminal capacity), our ownership of various marine-based terminals and our reputation for reliability and strong customer service provide us with a competitive advantage in marketing refined products in the areas in which we operate. 

Competitors of our natural gas sales operations generally include natural gas suppliers and distributors of varying sizes, financial resources and experience, including producers, pipeline companies, utilities and independent marketers. The principal methods of competition in our natural gas operations are in obtaining supply, pricing optionality for customers and effective support services, such as scheduling and risk management. We believe that our sizeable market presence and strong customer service and offerings provide us with a competitive advantage in marketing natural gas in the areas in which we operate. 

In our materials handling operations, we primarily compete with public and private port operators. Although customer decisions are substantially based on location, additional points of competition include types of services provided and pricing. We believe that our ability to provide materials handling services at a number of our refined products terminals and our demonstrated ability to handle a wide range of products provides us a competitive advantage in competing for products-related handling services in the areas in which we operate. 

Seasonality 

Demand for natural gas and some refined products, specifically heating oil and residual fuel oil for space heating purposes, is generally higher during the period of November through March than during the period of April through October. Therefore, our results of operations for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally stronger than for the second and third calendar quarters. For example, over the 36-month period ended December 31, 2015 , we generated an average of 73% of our total heating oil and residual fuel oil net sales during the months of November through March. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, our General Partner employed over 590 &#32;full-time employees who supported our operations, 70 &#32;of whom were covered by five collective bargaining agreements. One of these agreements, covering six employees, expires on March 31, 2016. Our Canadian subsidiary had 106 &#32;employees as of December 31, 2015, 43 &#32;of whom were covered by one collective bargaining agreement which expires March 19, 2016.
