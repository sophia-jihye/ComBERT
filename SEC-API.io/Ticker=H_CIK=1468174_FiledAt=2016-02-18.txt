 Item 1. Business. 

Our History 

Hyatt was founded by Jay Pritzker in 1957 when he purchased the Hyatt House motel adjacent to the Los Angeles International Airport. In 2004 substantially all of the hospitality assets owned by Pritzker family business interests, including Hyatt Corporation and Hyatt International Corporation, were consolidated under a single entity whose name was subsequently changed to Global Hyatt Corporation. On June 30, 2009, Global Hyatt Corporation changed its name to Hyatt Hotels Corporation. Hyatt Hotels Corporation is a global hospitality company with widely recognized, industry leading brands. We completed our initial public offering of our Class A common stock on November 10, 2009. 

Overview 

Hyatt Hotels Corporation is a global hospitality company with widely recognized, industry leading brands and a tradition of innovation developed over our more than fifty-year history. We develop, own, operate, manage, franchise, license or provide services to a portfolio of properties, consisting of full service hotels, select service hotels, resorts and other properties, including timeshare, fractional and other forms of residential and vacation properties. As of December 31, 2015 , our worldwide hotel portfolio consisted of 599 &#32;hotels ( 159,336 &#32;rooms). See Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Overview" for a categorized breakdown of our portfolio. 

Our full service hotels and resorts operate under six established brands: Park Hyatt, Grand Hyatt, Andaz, Hyatt Regency, Hyatt Centric and Hyatt, with Hyatt Centric having launched in 2015. Our two select service brands are Hyatt Place and Hyatt House, an extended stay brand. In 2013, we introduced Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara all inclusive resort brands, which marked our entry into the all inclusive resort segment. We also manage, provide services to or license our trademarks with respect to residential ownership units that are often adjacent to a Hyatt-branded full service hotel. We consult with third parties in the design and development of such mixed-use projects. We license our trademarks with respect to vacation ownership units, which are part of the Hyatt Residence Club. In 2014, we sold our vacation ownership business to an affiliate of Interval Leisure Group ("ILG") and entered into a long-term license agreement. 

Our colleagues, whom we refer to as members of the Hyatt family, are more than 100,000 &#32;individuals working at our corporate and regional offices and our managed, franchised and owned properties in 52 &#32;countries around the world. Substantially all of our hotel general managers are trained professionals in the hospitality industry with extensive hospitality experience in their local markets and host countries. The general managers of our managed properties are empowered to operate their properties on an independent basis using their market knowledge, management experience and understanding of our brands. Our colleagues and hotel general managers are supported by our regional management teams located in cities around the world and our executive management team, headquartered in Chicago. 

We primarily derive our revenues from hotel operations, management and franchise fees and other revenues from managed properties. For the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and December 31, 2014 , revenues totaled $4.3 billion &#32;and $4.4 billion , respectively, net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation totaled $124 million &#32;and $344 million , respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA totaled $727 million &#32;and $728 million , respectively. See Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Key Business Metrics Evaluated by Management&#8212;Adjusted EBITDA" for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, why we present it, and for a reconciliation of our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation for the periods presented. 

Corporate Realignment 

On October 1, 2012 we implemented a realignment of our corporate and regional operations to enhance organizational effectiveness and adaptability. The changes were designed to facilitate innovation and further advance Hyatt toward its goal of becoming the most preferred hospitality brand for our colleagues, guests, owners, operators, community members and shareholders. The organizational evolution was designed to position Hyatt to adapt quickly and effectively to guest and hotel owner needs during the expansion and growth we anticipate across all of our brands in multiple markets over the next several years. 

As part of the realignment, we established three operating segments: Americas management and franchising; Southeast Asia, China, Australia, South Korea and Japan ("ASPAC") management and franchising; and Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Southwest Asia ("EAME/SW Asia") management. The operating segments, together with our owned and leased hotels, form our four reportable segments. The results of our vacation ownership business both during our period of ownership and from the ongoing license agreement after the sale of this business in the fourth quarter of 2014, combined with the Hyatt co- 

branded credit card and unallocated corporate overhead, continue to be reported within corporate and other. See Note 18 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information on our segments. 

Additionally, as part of our realignment, we created two new functions, the Real Estate and Capital Strategy Group ("Capital Strategy Group") and the Global Operations Center ("GOC"). The Capital Strategy Group, whose costs are included as part of corporate expenses, is responsible for implementing Hyatt's overall capital strategy, managing its hotel asset base and providing support to Hyatt's development professionals around the world. The GOC, whose costs are allocated to our management and franchising businesses, is charged with ensuring that Hyatt's operating segments function according to company-wide principles and standards and enabling ongoing transformation and collaboration to ensure that we optimize our structure and resources. 

In furtherance of the realignment implemented in 2012, changes in 2014 included the expansion of the Capital Strategy Group responsibilities to include development and oversight of our overall franchising strategy. We also created the position of the Global President of Operations, who, together with the Group Presidents for each of Hyatt&#8217;s three lodging operating segments described above, is responsible for the successful operation of Hyatt&#8217;s hotels globally. 

Our Purpose, Goal and Values 

Our Purpose 

To care for people so they can be their best. 

Our Goal 

To become the most preferred hospitality brand&#8212;loved and respected by colleagues, guests, owners, operators, community members and shareholders. 

Our Values 

Respect, integrity, humility, empathy, creativity and fun are our shared core values. 

Our purpose, goal and values are brought to life by our colleagues, whom we refer to as the Hyatt family. We believe that our colleagues embody our purpose of caring for people, including each other, our guests and ultimately our owners. This commitment to genuine service and care is what differentiates us and drives guest preference. The management teams at each of our managed properties lead by example, and we provide them with the appropriate autonomy to make operational decisions in the best interest of the hotel and brand. We believe the managers of our franchised properties are experienced operators with high standards who have demonstrated commitment to our values and our approach to caring for guests to enhance guest satisfaction. High levels of guest satisfaction lead to increased guest preference for our brands, which we believe results in a strengthened revenue base over the long term. We also believe that engaged colleagues will enhance efficient operation of our properties, resulting in improved financial results for our property owners. Sustained adherence to these principles is a basis for our brand reputation and is one of the principal factors behind the decisions by our diverse group of hotel owners and developers to invest in the Hyatt portfolio of properties around the world. We work with existing and prospective hotel owners and developers to increase our presence around the world, which we expect will lead to guest satisfaction, brand preference and new channels for professional growth for our colleagues. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We have significant competitive strengths that support our goal of being the most preferred brand for our colleagues, guests and owners. 

World Class Brands. We believe that our widely recognized, industry leading brands provide us with a competitive advantage in attracting and driving preference for our colleagues, guests and owners. We have consistently received top rankings, awards and accolades for service and guest experience from independent publications and surveys, including Cond&#233; Nast Traveler, Travel and Leisure, Forbes and AAA. Our brand recognition and strength is key to our ability to drive preference among our colleagues, guests and owners. 

Global Platform with Compelling Growth Potential. Our existing global presence is widely distributed, and our hotels operate in 20 of the 25 most populous urban centers around the globe. We believe that our existing hotels provide us with a strong platform from which to selectively pursue new growth opportunities in markets where our brands are under-represented. Our dedicated global development executives in offices around the world apply their experience, judgment and knowledge to ensure that the Hyatt portfolio of properties enhances preference for our brands. An important aspect of our compelling growth potential is our strong brand presence in higher growth markets such as India, China, the Middle East and Brazil. The combination of our existing locations and brands, 

experienced development team, established third-party relationships and significant access to capital provides us with a strong foundation for future growth and long-term value creation. 

Deep Culture and Experienced Management Teams. Hyatt has a strong culture rooted in values that have supported our past success and form the foundation for our future. The members of the Hyatt family are united by shared values, a single purpose and a common goal. Our colleagues at Hyatt properties are led by an experienced group of general managers. For example, the general managers at our full service managed hotels have an average tenure of more than 22 years at Hyatt. Regional management teams located around the world support our hotel general managers by providing resources, mentorship and coaching, owner support and other assistance. Senior operating management has an average of approximately 30 years of experience in the industry. Our experienced executive management team sets overall policies for our company, supports our regional teams and our colleagues around the world, provides strategic direction and leads our global growth initiatives. 

Strong Capital Base and Disciplined Financial Approach. Our approach is to maintain appropriate levels of financial leverage through industry cycles and economic downturns. As of December 31, 2015 , we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $503 million &#32;and available borrowing capacity of $1.5 billion . We believe that as a result of our balance sheet strength, we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of strategic opportunities to develop or acquire properties and brands. We adhere to a formal investment process in evaluating such opportunities with input from various groups within our global organization. 

Diverse Exposure to Hotel Management, Franchising, Ownership and Development. We believe that our experience as a multi-brand manager, franchisor, owner and developer of hotels makes us one of the best positioned hospitality companies in the world. Our mix of managed, franchised and owned hotels provides a broad and diverse base of revenues, profits and cash flows and gives us flexibility to evaluate growth opportunities across these three lines of business. 

High Quality Owned Hotels Located in Desirable Markets. As of December 31, 2015 , our portfolio of properties consisted of luxury and upper-upscale full service hotels and resorts, upscale select service hotels and all inclusive resorts in key markets and totaled 33 &#32;owned properties and 35 &#32;managed or franchised properties that are owned or leased by unconsolidated hospitality ventures. Our owned full service hotels are located primarily in key markets, including major business centers and leisure destinations with strong growth potential, such as Chicago, London, Mexico City, New York, Paris, San Francisco, Seoul and Zurich. Our hospitality ventures include 50% ownership interests in properties in Mumbai and S&#227;o Paulo. A number of our owned hotels and hospitality venture properties are unique assets with high brand recognition and a strong position in their local markets. In 2014, we opened Park Hyatt New York, the flagship hotel of the globally recognized Park Hyatt brand, giving the brand representation in an additional key market. In 2013, we acquired Hyatt Regency Orlando, adding to our portfolio a high quality hotel located adjacent to one of the largest convention facilities in the United States. As a significant owner of hotel assets, we believe we are well-positioned when demand strengthens, as we expect earnings growth from owned properties to outpace revenue growth at managed properties during periods of increasing demand and room rates due to the operating leverage inherent in owned properties. This benefit can be achieved through increased earnings from our owned assets and through value realized from selected asset sales. 

Our Business Strategy 

Our strategy for reaching our goal to become the most preferred hospitality brand is based on differentiating Hyatt through powerful brands and innovation and generating long-term, sustainable growth for the company that will create shareholder value and career development opportunities for colleagues. We implement our strategy through a focus on four strategic priorities: 

Cultivate the Best People and Evolve the Culture 

Cultivating the best people and evolving the culture focuses on attracting, developing, rewarding and retaining individuals who distinguish Hyatt from our competitors and provide a unique experience to our guests. We recognize that our people and our culture are our greatest assets. Our goal is to develop a strong pipeline of diverse and talented colleagues and to provide them with opportunities to fulfill their personal potential and development while helping to make Hyatt successful. 

Our brands are defined, in large part, by the commitment to genuine service and care that our colleagues deliver to our guests. We believe that while a great product is necessary for success, a service model that promotes genuine care for our guests and that is focused on their particular needs is the key to a sustainable long-term advantage. Therefore, we strive to involve our colleagues in deciding how we care for our guests and identifying what we can do to improve guest satisfaction. We rely on our hotel general managers to lead by example and foster colleague engagement. We believe that 

colleague engagement results in higher levels of customer satisfaction and improves the performance of our properties. To assist in this process, we aim to ensure that talented management teams are in place worldwide and to reward those teams that achieve higher levels of colleague engagement, guest satisfaction and hotel financial performance. 

Our reputation is a reflection of how we conduct ourselves and our business in the communities in which we live and work. One of our principal tools to enhance Hyatt's reputation is Hyatt Thrive, our corporate responsibility program. Through Hyatt Thrive initiatives we volunteer in our communities, support organizations that work in our communities, and work to reduce our waste and carbon footprint &#8211; in short, to make the communities in which we operate places where we want to live, where guests want to visit and where our owners want to invest. 

Build and Deliver Brand-Led Experiences 

In support of our goal to become the most preferred hospitality brand and to foster quality growth, we have focused on creating a meaningful portfolio of brands that deliver unique experiences. Our objective is to differentiate our brands both from one another, and from our competitors. We have developed a personality and identity for each brand that results in a distinct look and reflects experiences and attributes unique to that particular brand. 

Successful innovation has been a hallmark of Hyatt since its founding, with a commitment to impactful architectural design in both the large-scale convention and smaller leisure markets. We continuously probe deeper and uncover new opportunities for enhancing the guest experience in each of our brands. We have a long track record of creative approaches to food and beverage at our hotels throughout the world, and we have created profitable and sought-after venues that create and enhance demand for our hotel properties. 

Our Hyatt Gold Passport guest loyalty program is designed to attract new guests and to demonstrate our loyalty to our existing guests. In 2015 , Hyatt Gold Passport won two Freddie Awards, best elite travel program in the Americas and best elite travel program in the Middle East/ Asia/ Oceania. The Hyatt Credit Card, a co-branded Visa credit card between Hyatt and Chase Card Services, continued to show strong growth in card member acquisitions and member engagement. 

Operate with Excellence 

A key component of our strategy is to maximize revenues and manage costs at our managed hotel properties. We strive to optimize revenues by focusing on revenue management and establishing and increasing guest loyalty to our brands. We work to expand Hyatt's share of room revenue by continuously striving to provide genuine guest service and delivering value to our guests. Our existing customer base is diverse with different needs and preferences. We aim to provide differentiated service and product offerings targeted at each customer segment within each of our brands, including meeting planners and convention guests, leisure guests and business travelers, in order to satisfy our customers' specific needs. 

We manage costs by setting performance goals for our hotel management teams, and granting our general managers operational autonomy. We support these cost management efforts by providing our general managers with tools and analytics from our regional and corporate offices and by compensating our hotel management teams based on property performance. In addition to managing hotel level costs, we strive to keep corporate costs aligned with growth through efficient resource allocation, which we expect will generate savings supporting our ability to fund additional growth and further invest in our brands. 

Grow With Intent 

We are focused on creating long-term shareholder value, and on where and how we invest to expand our presence in key locations. We believe that the scale of our presence around the world is small relative to the recognition of our brands and our excellent reputation for service and, therefore, we have a unique opportunity to grow. 

o 

Increase Market Presence. We focus our expansion efforts on under-penetrated markets where we already have an established presence and on locations where our guests are traveling but where we do not have a presence. We intend to expand our presence by increasing the number of hotels in the Hyatt portfolio, primarily by entering into new management and franchise agreements. We believe our intense focus on each customer group that we serve and our understanding of how we can serve them in new locations will result in quality growth. Over the past few years, we have made significant progress in expanding our presence through development of new hotels and conversion of existing hotels. For example, in New York City, we have expanded our presence from one property at the time of our IPO in 2009 to eight properties as of December 31, 2015. Expansion in dynamic markets like China and India is central to our growth strategy as representation in key cities and resort destinations provides the Company with the opportunity to drive preference for our brands as we serve a broader base of guests in these high growth markets. As of 

December 31, 2015 , there were approximately 105 hotels open or under development in China in markets such as Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen. In India, the total number of hotels open or under development was approximately 40 properties as of December 31, 2015 . In addition to China and India, we have also announced further expansion plans into diverse international markets including Australia, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Republic of Georgia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Thailand and Uruguay. 

o 

Expand Select Service Presence . We continue to expand Hyatt Place and Hyatt House, which we believe will support our overall growth and enhance the performance of all of our brands. We intend to grow our select service presence through third-party construction of new franchised properties, conversion and renovation of existing non-Hyatt properties, and in certain cases, participation in the development of new managed properties. We believe that the opportunity for properties that provide a select offering of services at a lower price point than full service hotels is particularly compelling in certain markets, including India, China and the Middle East, where there is a large and growing middle class along with a meaningful number of local business travelers. As of December 31, 2015, we had 19 Hyatt Place hotels operating outside of the United States in 11 countries, throughout Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America. In addition to these hotels, we have announced new management agreements for select service properties currently under development in Brazil, Canada, China, Guatemala, India, Mexico, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 

o 

Increase Focus on Franchising. We continue to increase our franchised hotel presence, primarily in the United States. By increasing our focus on franchising, we believe that we will gain access to capital from developers and property owners that specifically target franchise business opportunities. We have an internal team dedicated to supporting our franchise owners and to driving the expansion of our franchised hotel presence. We plan to expand existing relationships and develop new relationships with franchisees who demonstrate an ability to provide excellent customer service and maintain our brand standards. In support of our strategy, we recently sold several individual full service hotels and portfolios of select service hotels subject to long-term franchise agreements with the purchasers. 

o 

Utilize our Capital and Asset Base for Targeted Growth. The combination of our significant liquidity and strong capital position coupled with our large, high quality asset base provides a unique platform to support our growth strategy. We take a comprehensive approach to our efforts to recycle hotel real estate assets and to manage capital deployment in furtherance of our expansion plans. Capital deployment will continue to be done with an objective to maximize long-term shareholder value and we will assess and balance liquidity, value and strategic importance in each instance. We also will continue to commit capital to fund the renovation of certain assets in our owned portfolio. While we will selectively dispose of hotel properties, we expect to maintain significant ownership of hotel properties over time given our focus and expertise as an owner. During 2014 and 2015, we sold several individual full service hotels and portfolios of select service hotels. Asset sales are consistent with the Company&#8217;s asset recycling strategy&#8212;selling certain hotels, maintaining presence in markets by entering into new management or franchise agreements, and re-investing sale proceeds into new hotels and other growth opportunities, including investments in hospitality ventures. 

o 

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances. We expect to continue to evaluate potential acquisitions of other brands or hospitality management or franchising companies as a part of our efforts to expand our presence. These acquisitions may include hotel real estate. We expect to focus on acquisitions that complement our ability to serve our existing customer base and enhance customer preference by providing a greater selection of locations, properties and services. Furthermore, we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties to strengthen our brand presence.

Hyatt Residence Club members can choose to occupy their vacation home, exchange time among 16 &#32;Hyatt Residence Club locations, trade their time for Hyatt Gold Passport points or travel within the Hyatt system. Alternatively, members can exchange their intervals for stays at other properties participating within Interval International&#8217;s program, which has over 2,900 resorts in its exchange network worldwide. 

Residential Ownership Units 

Residential ownership units refer to residential units that we manage, or to which we provide services or license our trademarks, such as serviced apartments and Hyatt-branded residential units. Many locations are near or adjacent to full service hotels that are members of the Hyatt portfolio of properties, while others are in unique leisure locations. Studio units feature kitchenettes, while one, two and three bedroom units contain fully equipped kitchens, dining areas and living rooms. Residents in some locations are able to utilize various nearby Hyatt hotel services. 

Our Commitment to Corporate Responsibility 

Hyatt&#8217;s global corporate responsibility platform, Hyatt Thrive, is an integral part of our business. We recognize that when our people, communities and planet thrive, so does our business. The platform is focused on environmental stewardship, strengthening our community impact through volunteerism, philanthropy and disaster relief and ensuring that responsible business practices govern our operations. By setting goals, measuring progress, and harnessing the power of our more than 100,000 colleagues around the world, we strive to make a tangible impact within and beyond the walls of our hotels. And as a result, we believe our communities are places where our colleagues want to work, our guests want to visit, our neighbors want to live and hotel owners want to invest. 

During 2015, we announced a partnership with Khan Academy, a non-profit organization that is dedicated to providing free access to world-class education online. This partnership will assist us in bringing learning programs to all our colleagues around the world, their families and their communities. 

Management Agreements 

We manage hotels and residential properties worldwide pursuant to management agreements. 

Fees 

Our management agreements typically provide for a two-tiered fee structure that compensates us both for the volume of business we generate for the property as well as for the profitability of hotel operations. In these two-tier fee structures, our base compensation is a base fee that is usually an agreed upon percentage of gross revenues from hotel operations. In addition, we are incentivized to improve hotel profitability through an incentive fee that is typically calculated as a percentage of a hotel profitability measure, such as gross operating profit, adjusted profit or the amount by which gross operating profit or adjusted profit exceeds a specified threshold. Outside of the United States our fees are often more dependent on hotel profitability measures either through a single management fee structure where the entire fee is based on a profitability measure, or because our two-tier fee structure is more heavily weighted toward the incentive fee than the base fee. 

Terms and Renewals 

The average remaining term of our management agreements with third-party owners and unconsolidated hospitality ventures for full service hotels and select service hotels (other than those currently under development) is approximately as follows: 

&#160; 

Assuming no renewal options are exercised by either party: 

&#160; 

Including exercise of extension options that are in Hyatt's sole discretion and assuming in certain cases that financial performance tests have been met:

Some of our management agreements grant early termination rights to hotel owners upon the occurrence of a stated event, such as the sale of the hotel or our failure to meet a specified performance test (any such event a &#8220;termination event&#8221;). In the case of a termination event, some of our management agreements grant hotel owners the right to terminate the management agreement and convert the hotel to a Hyatt franchise. Generally, termination rights under performance tests are based upon the property's individual performance or its performance when compared to a specified set of competitive hotels branded by other hotel operators, or both. These termination rights are usually triggered if we do not meet the performance tests over multiple years. We generally have the option to cure performance failures by paying an amount equal to the shortfall, but in some cases our cure rights may be limited and the result of our failure to meet a performance test may be the termination of our management agreement. 

Many of our management agreements are subordinated to mortgages or other secured indebtedness of the owners. In the United States, most lenders have agreed to recognize our right to continue to manage the hotels under the terms set forth in the management agreements if the lenders take possession of the hotel property through foreclosure or similar means. 

Franchise Agreements 

Our franchise agreements grant our franchisees the limited right to use our name, marks and system in the operation of franchised Hyatt Regency, Hyatt Centric, Hyatt, Hyatt Place, Hyatt House, Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara properties. We do not participate in the management of our franchised hotels; however, franchisees are required to operate franchised hotels consistent with our brand standards. We approve the plans for, and the location of, franchised hotels and review the operation of these hotels to ensure that our standards are maintained. 

Fees 

In general, our franchisees pay us an initial application fee and ongoing royalty fees, the amount of which depends on whether the franchised property is a select service hotel or full service hotel. We franchise full service hotels under the Hyatt Regency, Hyatt Centric and Hyatt brands, and all inclusive resorts under the Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara brands. We franchise 

select service hotels under the Hyatt Place and Hyatt House brands. Application fees are typically $60,000 for our Hyatt Place hotels and our Hyatt House hotels and the greater of $100,000 or $300 per guest room for our full service hotels and all inclusive resorts. Select service franchisees pay continuing franchise fees calculated as a percentage of gross room revenues, which typically are 3% in the first year of operations, 4% in the second year and 5% through the remainder of the term. Our Hyatt Regency and Hyatt franchisees typically pay us franchise fees calculated as 6% of gross room revenues and 3% of gross food and beverage revenues. Our Hyatt Centric franchisees typically pay us franchise fees calculated as 5% of gross room revenues. In some circumstances, we have negotiated other fee arrangements. Our all inclusive franchisees typically pay us franchise fees calculated as 2.75% of gross revenues. 

In addition to our franchise fees, we charge full service hotel and all inclusive resort franchisees for certain services arranged and provided by us. These activities include centralized reservation functions, certain sales functions, information technology, national advertising, marketing and promotional services, as well as various revenue management services. We also charge select service franchisees for marketing, central reservations and technology services. 

Terms and Renewals 

The standard term of our franchise agreements is typically 20 years, with one 10 year renewal option exercisable by the franchisee, assuming the franchisee has complied with franchise agreement requirements and standards. Certain of our franchise agreements have renewal options at Hyatt's option. We have the right to terminate franchise agreements upon specified events of default, including non-payment of fees and non-compliance with brand standards. In the event of early termination for any reason, our franchise agreements set forth liquidated damages that our franchisees must pay to us upon termination. The bankruptcy of a franchisee or lender foreclosure could result in the termination of the franchise agreement. The average remaining base term of our franchise agreements for our select service and full service hotels (other than those currently under development) is approximately 17 years, assuming no renewal options are exercised by either party. Including exercise of extension options in Hyatt&#8217;s discretion, the average remaining term of our franchise agreements for our select service hotels and full service hotels (other than those currently under development) is approximately 19 years. 

Business Segment, Revenues and Geographical Information 

For information regarding our four reportable business segments, revenues and geographical information, see Note 18 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. 

Sales, Marketing and Reservations 

Sales 

We deploy a global sales team as well as regional sales teams in our Americas, ASPAC and EAME/SW Asia segments. The global team is responsible for our largest and most significant accounts doing business in all three regions. The regional teams are responsible for large accounts that typically do business within one region but at multiple hotels within the region. The global and regional sales teams coordinate efforts with the hotel sales teams. The in-house sales colleagues are focused on local and regional business opportunities, as well as securing the business generated from our key global and regional accounts. 

Our corporate sales organizations are focused on growing market share with key accounts, identifying new business opportunities and maximizing our local customer base. Our key accounts consist of: major corporations; national, state and regional associations; specialty market accounts (social, government, military, educational, religious and fraternal); travel organizations; and a broad and diverse group of individual consumers. Our global and regional sales teams target multiple brands to key customer accounts within these groups. No one customer is material to our business. Our global and regional teams consist of over 200 colleagues at global and regional sales offices around the world, who are focused on group business, business and leisure traveler accounts and travel agencies. 

Sales colleagues at our regional offices and at many of our full service hotels use Envision, our proprietary sales tool, to manage the group rooms forecast, maintain an inventory of definite and tentative group rooms booked each day, streamline the process of checking guest room availability and rate quotes, and determine meeting room availability. 

We seek to maximize revenues in each hotel through a team of revenue management professionals. The goal of revenue management is to secure the right customers, on the right date, at the right price. Business opportunities are reviewed and agreed upon by the hotel's management team. 

Marketing 

Our marketing strategy is designed to maintain and build brand loyalty, value and awareness while meeting the specific business needs of hotel operations. Building and differentiating each of our brands is critical to increasing Hyatt's brand 

preference. We are focused on targeting the distinct guest segments that each of our brands serves and supporting the needs of the hotels by thorough analysis and application of data and analytics. Hyatt Gold Passport and Hyatt.com are also key components of building loyalty and driving revenue. Hyatt Gold Passport is a loyalty program with a focus on driving guest satisfaction, recognition and differential services for our most loyal guests. Hyatt.com is our primary online distribution channel providing customers with an efficient source of information about our hotels and an effective booking experience. With a combined focus on increasing brand awareness, building a community of loyalists and enhancing digital engagement, our marketing is aimed at Hyatt becoming the most preferred hospitality brand. 

Reservations 

We have a central reservation system that provides a comprehensive view of inventory, while allowing for local management of rates based on demand. Through this system, we are able to allow bookings by hotels directly, via telephone through our call centers, by travel agents and online through Hyatt.com. 

We have seven global contact centers that service our global guest base 24 hours per day, seven days per week and provide reservation services in over 20 languages. While we continue to provide full reservation services via telephone through our global contact centers, we have made significant investments in internet booking capabilities on Hyatt.com web and mobile platforms. 

In addition, some of the rooms at hotels and resorts we manage or franchise are booked through internet travel intermediaries, partners or online travel service providers. We also engage third-party intermediaries who collect fees by charging our hotels and resorts a commission on room revenues, including travel agencies and meeting and event management companies. 

Hyatt Gold Passport 

We operate Hyatt Gold Passport, a guest loyalty program that generates substantial repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel nights and other rewards. 

Hyatt Gold Passport members earn points based on their spending at our properties or in connection with spending on the Hyatt Credit Card. Hyatt Gold Passport points can be redeemed at all properties across our brands and can also be converted into airline miles with numerous participating airlines and redeemed with other third parties. 

Hyatt Gold Passport is funded through a contribution from eligible revenues generated from Hyatt Gold Passport members. These funds are applied to reimburse hotels for room nights when members redeem Hyatt Gold Passport points and to pay for administrative expenses and marketing initiatives to support the program. 

As of December 31, 2015 , Hyatt Gold Passport had over 20 million members, and during 2015 , Hyatt Gold Passport members represented 35% of total room nights systemwide. 

Competition 

There is intense competition in all areas of the hospitality industry. Competition exists for hotel guests, management and franchise agreements, and sales of vacation ownership properties and branded residential properties. Our principal competitors are other operators of full service, select service, all inclusive and extended stay properties, including other major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands. We also compete against small chains and independent and local owners and operators. Increasingly, we also face competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry. Additional sources of competition include large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model, such as Alibaba, search engines such as Google, and peer-to-peer inventory sources that allow travelers to book stays on websites that facilitate the short-term rental of homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms, such as Airbnb and HomeAway. 

We compete for guests based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, location, customer satisfaction, room rates, quality of service, amenities, quality of accommodations, security and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points. 

We compete for management agreements based primarily on the value and quality of our management services, our brand name recognition and reputation, our ability and willingness to invest our capital in third-party owned or hospitality venture projects, the level of our management fees and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brand name. We compete for franchise agreements based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, the room rate that can be realized and total revenues we can deliver to the properties. Other competitive factors for management and franchise agreements include relationships with property owners and investors, including institutional owners 

of multiple properties, marketing support, reservation and e-commerce system capacity and efficiency, and the ability to make investments that may be necessary to obtain management and franchise agreements. 

The number of branded lodging operators with a global reach and depth of product and offerings similar to us is limited. We believe that our strong customer base, prominent brand recognition, strategic property locations and global development team enable us to compete effectively. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;Because we operate in a highly competitive industry, our revenues, profits or market share could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively, and new distribution channels, alternatives to traditional hotels and industry consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business." 

Seasonality 

The hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. The periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property, depending principally upon location and the customer base served. Based upon historical results, our properties in the Americas typically generate the highest revenues in the second quarter and the lowest in the first quarter. In both ASPAC and in EAME/SW Asia, the highest revenues typically are generated in the fourth quarter with the next highest revenues generated in the second quarter. 

Cyclicality 

The hospitality industry is cyclical and generally follows, on a lagged basis, the overall economy. There is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms, in occupancy levels and in rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles. Variability of results through some of the cycles in the past has been more severe due to changes in the supply of hotel rooms in given markets or in given categories of hotels. The combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners, managers and franchisors of hotel properties. The costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable. Because of this, in an environment of declining revenues the rate of decline in earnings will be higher than the rate of decline in revenues. Conversely, in an environment of increasing demand and room rates, the rate of increase in earnings is typically higher than the rate of increase in revenues. 

Intellectual Property 

In the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos are very important in the sales and marketing of our hotels, residential and vacation ownership properties and services. We have a significant number of trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos and pending registrations, and significant resources are expended each year on surveillance, registration and protection of our trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos, which we believe have become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and care. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;Any failure to protect our trademarks and intellectual property could reduce the value of our brand names and harm our business." 

Government Regulation 

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local government laws and regulations, including those relating to the preparation and sale of food and beverages, building and zoning requirements, data privacy and general business license and permit requirements, in the various jurisdictions in which we manage, franchise, license and own properties. Our ability to develop new hotel properties and to remodel, refurbish or add to existing properties is also dependent on obtaining permits from local authorities. We are also subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, hiring and firing, non-discrimination for disabilities and other individual characteristics, work permits and benefit offerings. Federal, state and provincial laws and regulations require certain registration, disclosure statements, compliance with specific standards of conduct and other practices with respect to the franchising of hotels. Additionally, the vacation ownership properties we operated prior to disposition in the fourth quarter of 2014 are subject to local, state and federal requirements regarding the licensing of sales agents, compliance of marketing materials and numerous other requirements regarding the sale and management of vacation ownership properties. Compliance with these various laws and regulations can affect the revenues and profits of properties managed, franchised, licensed or owned and of the vacation ownership business and could adversely affect our operations. We believe that our businesses are conducted in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 

We manage and own hotels with casino gaming operations as part of or adjacent to the hotels. However, with the exception of the Hyatt Regency Aruba Resort Spa and Casino, third parties manage and operate the casinos. We hold and maintain the casino gaming license and manage the casino located at the Hyatt Regency Aruba Resort Spa and Casino and employ third-party compliance consultants and service providers. As a result, our business operations at the Hyatt Regency 

Aruba Resort Spa and Casino are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Departamento pa Asuntonan di Casino (D.A.C.), the regulatory agency responsible for gaming licenses and operations in Aruba. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 45,000 &#32;employees at our corporate offices, regional offices, owned and managed hotels and residential properties. Approximately 27% &#32;of those employees were either represented by a labor union or had terms of employment that were determined under a labor agreement. Some of our more than 100,000 &#32;colleagues are employed by certain third-party owners and franchisees of our hotels and are not included in the 45,000 &#32;figure above because we do not directly employ them. We believe relations with our employees and colleagues are good. 

Environmental Matters 

In connection with our ownership and management of hotels and development of other real properties, we are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under some of these laws, a current or former owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of investigating or remediating hazardous or toxic substances or wastes on, under or in such real property, as well as third-party sites where the owner or operator sent wastes for disposal. Such laws may impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew, or was at fault in connection with, the presence or release of such hazardous substances or wastes. Although we are not aware of any current material obligations for investigating or remediating hazardous substances or wastes at our owned properties, the future discovery of substances or wastes at any of our owned properties, or the failure to remediate such contaminated property properly, could adversely affect our ability to develop or sell such real estate, or to borrow using such real estate as collateral. In addition, the costs of investigating or remediating contamination, at our properties or at properties where we sent substances or wastes for disposal, may be substantial. 

We are also subject to various requirements, including those contained in environmental permits required for our operations, governing air emissions, effluent discharges, the use, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and health and safety. From time to time, we may be required to manage, abate or remove mold, lead or asbestos-containing materials at our properties. We believe that our properties and operations are in compliance, in all material respects, with all foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and ordinances. However, additional operating costs and capital expenditures could be incurred if additional or more stringent requirements are enacted in the future. 

Insurance 

Properties that the Company owns outright or through hospitality ventures, manages, franchises and licenses are insured under different insurance programs depending on whether the property participates in our insurance programs or in the insurance programs of the owner (including hospitality ventures), franchisee or licensee. We maintain insurance coverage for hotels owned by the Company under our insurance programs for liability, property, workers compensation and other risks with respect to our business. Our liability insurance provides coverage for most claims, including terrorism, resulting from our operations, goods and services and automobiles. Our property insurance provides coverage for all risks to our properties including fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism. Property insurance also includes business interruption coverage. Our workers compensation insurance provides coverage for employee injuries in the course and scope of employment. Hotels owned by hospitality ventures or hotels managed by the Company are permitted to participate in our insurance programs by mutual agreement with our hospitality venture partners or third-party hotel owners. The majority of hotels owned by hospitality ventures and managed hotels owned by third parties participate in our insurance programs. Our hospitality venture agreements and management agreements require hotels owned by hospitality ventures and managed hotels owned by third parties that do not participate in our insurance programs to be insured at coverage levels generally consistent with the coverage levels under our insurance programs, including liability, property, business interruption, workers compensation and other insurance. We are typically covered under these insurance policies to the extent necessary and reasonable. Our franchise and license agreements require our franchisees and licensees to maintain liability, property, business interruption, workers compensation and other insurance at our franchised or licensed properties. We are typically covered under these insurance policies to the extent necessary and reasonable. We believe the Company's insurance policies, as well as those maintained by third-party owners, including hospitality ventures, are adequate for foreseeable losses and on terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary with solvent insurance carriers. We also self-insure some of our risks generally through the use of deductibles and retentions. We believe these deductibles and retentions are reasonable and customary for our industry and our size. We use a U.S. based and licensed captive insurance company that is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hyatt to generally insure our deductibles and retentions. 

Stockholder Agreements 

The following is a summary of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement, the Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement and the Global Hyatt Corporation 2007 Stockholders' Agreement (the "2007 Stockholders' Agreement"). The following descriptions of these agreements do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by, the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement, Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement and 2007 Stockholders' Agreement, copies of which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and are incorporated by reference herein. For additional information regarding these agreements, please also refer to Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Share Ownership and Other Stockholder Matters." 

Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement 

The trustees of the U.S. situs trusts for the benefit of certain lineal descendants of Nicholas J. Pritzker, deceased, that own, directly or indirectly, shares of our common stock, and the adult beneficiaries of such trusts, including Mr. Thomas J. Pritzker, our executive chairman, and Mr. Jason Pritzker, one of our directors, have entered into the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement pursuant to which they have agreed to, among other things, certain voting agreements and limitations on the sale of shares of our common stock. As of January 31, 2016, Pritzker family business interests own, directly or indirectly, 84,541,406 shares, or 62.3% , of our total outstanding common stock and control approximately 75.3% &#32;of our total voting power. Specifically, such parties have agreed that until the date upon which more than 75% of the Company's fully diluted shares of common stock is owned by persons other than Pritzker family members and spouses (including any U.S. or non-U.S. situs trusts for the current or future, direct or indirect, vested or contingent, benefit of Pritzker family members and spouses), all Pritzkers (and their successors in interest, if applicable), but not the transferees by sale (other than Pritzkers who purchase directly from other Pritzkers), will vote all of their voting securities consistent with the recommendations of our board of directors with respect to all matters assuming agreement as to any such matter by a majority of a minimum of three independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) or, in the case of transactions involving us and an affiliate, assuming agreement of all of such minimum of three independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker). All Pritzkers have agreed to cast and submit by proxy to us their votes in a manner consistent with the foregoing voting agreement at least five business days prior to the scheduled date of any annual or special meeting of stockholders. 

In addition, such parties have agreed that until the date upon which more than 75% of the Company's fully diluted shares of common stock is owned by persons other than Pritzker family members and spouses (including any U.S. or non-U.S. situs trusts for the current or future, direct or indirect, vested or contingent, benefit of any Pritzker family members and spouses), all Pritzker family members and spouses (including U.S. and non-U.S. situs trusts for the current or future, direct or indirect, vested or contingent, benefit of any Pritzker family members and spouses or affiliates of any thereof) in a "beneficiary group" (including trusts only to the extent of the then current benefit of members of such beneficiary group) may sell up to 25% of their aggregate holdings of our common stock, measured as of November 4, 2009, the date of effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-161068) relating to our initial public offering of our Class A common stock, in each 12-month period following the date of effectiveness of such registration statement (without carry-overs), and shall not sell more than such amount during any such period. Upon the unanimous affirmative vote of our independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker), such 25% limitation may, with respect to each such 12 month period, be increased to a higher percentage or waived entirely. Sales of our common stock, including Class A common stock and Class B common stock, between and among Pritzkers is permitted without regard to the sale restrictions described above and such sales are not counted against the 25% sale limitation. 

All shares of our common stock owned by each beneficiary group (including trusts only to the extent of the then current benefit of members of such beneficiary group) are freely pledgeable to an institutional lender and such institutional lender will not be subject to the sale restrictions described above upon default and foreclosure. 

The Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement may be amended, modified, supplemented or restated by the written agreement of the successors to Mr. Thomas J. Pritzker, Mr. Marshall E. Eisenberg and Mr. Karl J. Breyer, solely in their capacity as co-trustees of the Pritzker family U.S. situs trusts, 75% of the adult beneficiaries named below and a majority of the other adult beneficiaries party to the agreement. Each of Thomas J. Pritzker, Nicholas J. Pritzker, Jennifer N. Pritzker, John A. Pritzker, Linda Pritzker, Karen L. Pritzker, Penny Pritzker, Daniel F. Pritzker, Anthony N. Pritzker, Gigi Pritzker Pucker and Jay Robert Pritzker, and their respective lineal descendants and current spouse, if relevant, make up a "beneficiary group." 

Disputes that relate to the subject matter of the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement are subject to arbitration pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The exclusive requirement to arbitrate under the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement shall not apply with respect to the manner in which Hyatt's operations are conducted to the extent the parties (in their capacities as stockholders) and non-Pritzker public stockholders are affected comparably; provided, however, that a party may participate in and benefit from any shareholder litigation initiated by a non-party to the agreement. A party to the agreement may not solicit others to initiate or be a named plaintiff in such litigation (i) unless two thirds of the independent 

directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) of a board of directors having at least three independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) do not vote in favor of the matter that is the subject of the litigation or (ii) in the case of affiliated transactions reviewed by our board of directors, unless at least one independent director (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) did not approve the transaction. 

Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement 

The trustees of the non-U.S. situs trusts for the benefit of certain lineal descendants of Nicholas J. Pritzker, deceased, that own, directly or indirectly, shares of our common stock, and the adult beneficiaries of such trusts, including Mr. Thomas J. Pritzker and Mr. Jason Pritzker, have entered into the Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement pursuant to which they have agreed to, among other things, certain voting agreements and limitations on the sale of shares of our common stock.

Pritzker, Gigi Pritzker Pucker and Jay Robert Pritzker, and their respective lineal descendants and current spouse, if relevant, make up a "beneficiary group." 

Disputes that relate to the subject matter of the Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement are subject to arbitration pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The exclusive requirement to arbitrate under the Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement shall not apply with respect to the manner in which Hyatt's operations are conducted to the extent the parties (in their capacities as stockholders) and non-Pritzker public stockholders are affected comparably; provided, however, that a party may participate in and benefit from any shareholder litigation initiated by a non-party to the agreement. A party to the agreement may not solicit others to initiate or be a named plaintiff in such litigation (i) unless two thirds of the independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) of a board of directors having at least three independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) do not vote in favor of the matter that is the subject of the litigation or (ii) in the case of affiliated transactions reviewed by our board of directors, unless at least one independent director (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) did not approve the transaction. 

2007 Stockholders' Agreement 

In connection with the issuance and sale of 100,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to GS Sunray Holdings, L.L.C. ("GSSH") and GS Sunray Holdings Parallel, L.L.C. ("GSSHP" and collectively with GSSH, the "Goldman Sachs Funds"), affiliates of Goldman, Sachs &#38; Co., and the execution of a Subscription Agreement in August 2007, we entered into the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement with Madrone GHC, LLC and affiliates (collectively, "Madrone"), the Goldman Sachs Funds and an additional investor that provides for certain rights and obligations of these stockholders, including the following: 

Transfer Restrictions 

Other than with respect to the 6,118,275 shares of common stock received by such stockholders in the May 2009 private placement transaction (which, upon the filing of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation on November 4, 2009, were reclassified into an equal number of shares of Class B common stock), these stockholders were previously restricted from transferring any shares of our common stock held by them, except to us, or with the prior written consent of our board of directors, to their affiliates, in limited amounts over specified time periods and as otherwise permitted pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The transfer restrictions set forth in the 2007 Stockholders&#8217; Agreement, other than those set forth below, expired at 11:59 p.m. (Central time) on May 11, 2015, which is the day after the date that is the five and one-half year anniversary of November 10, 2009 (the closing date of our initial public offering). However, all shares held by such stockholders, including those received in the May 2009 private placement transaction, remain subject to the rights of first refusal and "drag along" rights described below. 

No stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement may transfer (1) the legal or beneficial ownership of any common stock held by such stockholder unless such acquiring person's ownership of common stock is not reasonably likely to jeopardize any licensing from a governmental authority, as determined by our board of directors in its reasonable discretion, (2) any common stock to an aggregator (meaning a person who is required to file a Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act disclosing an interest other than for investment), (3) any common stock to a competitor of ours engaged in one or more of the hospitality, lodging and/or gaming industries or (4) any common stock that would cause a stockholder to violate any provision of the agreement. Such restrictions are qualified by the "actual knowledge" of the transferring stockholder in the case of transfers pursuant to an underwritten public offering or a broad distribution sale. 

Right of First Refusal 

In the event that the number of shares of common stock proposed to be transferred by a stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement and its affiliates together with any shares of common stock then proposed to be transferred by the other stockholders party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement and their affiliates exceeds 2% of the then outstanding shares of common stock, then prior to consummating the sale of common stock to a third-party purchaser, such stockholder or stockholders shall offer to transfer the common stock to us at the applicable market value (as defined in the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement). If we do not accept the offer within a specified period of time, such stockholder or stockholders may transfer the shares of common stock to the third-party purchaser as long as such transfer occurs within the time periods specified in the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement and on terms and conditions no more favorable in the aggregate than those offered to us. 

"Drag-Along" Right 

In connection with a "change of control" (as defined in the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement) transaction, we have the right to require each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement to participate in such change of control transaction on the same terms, conditions and price per share of common stock as those applicable to the other holders of our common stock. In addition, upon our request, the stockholders party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement have agreed to vote in favor of such change of control transaction or similar transaction, and we have the right to require each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement to vote for, consent to and raise no objection to any such transaction. 

"Tag-Along" Right 

Subject to the fiduciary duties of our board of directors, we have agreed that we will not agree to consummate a change of control transaction with respect to which the stockholders party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement are not given the right to participate on the same terms, conditions and price per share of common stock as those applicable to the other holders of our common stock. 

Preemptive Rights 

Each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement has the right to purchase such stockholder's pro rata share of any new shares of common stock, or any other equity securities, that we may propose to sell and issue on comparable terms by making an election within the time periods specified in the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement, subject to certain excluded securities issuances described in the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement, including shares issued pursuant to equity compensation plans adopted by our board of directors and the issuance of shares of our common stock in a public offering. If not all stockholders elect to purchase their full preemptive allocation of new securities, then we will notify the fully-participating stockholders and offer them the right to purchase the unsubscribed new securities. 

Voting Agreement 

Until the date that Mr. Thomas J. Pritzker is no longer our chairman, each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement has agreed to vote all of their shares of common stock consistent with the recommendations of a majority of our board of directors with respect to all matters. As of January 31, 2016, the stockholders party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement own in the aggregate 25,112,086 shares of Class B common stock, or approximately 18.5% &#32;of the outstanding shares of our common stock and approximately 22.4% &#32;of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock. 

Access to Information 

For so long as GSSHP owns any shares of common stock, we have agreed that GS Capital Partners VI Parallel, L.P. or its representatives may examine our books and records and visit and inspect our facilities and may reasonably request information at reasonable time and intervals concerning the general status of our financial condition and operations. Additionally, on reasonable prior notice, GS Capital Partners VI Parallel, L.P. or its representatives may discuss our business operations, properties and financial and other conditions with our management, independent accountants and investment bankers. In no event shall we be required to provide access to any information that we reasonably believe would constitute attorney/client privileged communications or would violate any securities laws. 

Standstill 

Under the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement, each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement agreed that, subject to certain limited exceptions, so long as such stockholder owns shares of common stock, neither such stockholder nor any of its related persons will in any manner, directly or indirectly: 

&#8226; 

effect or seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect, or announce any intention to effect or cause or participate in or in any way assist, facilitate or encourage any other person to effect or seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect or participate in, (a) any acquisition of any of our or our subsidiaries' securities (or beneficial ownership thereof) (except through the proper exercise of preemptive rights granted under the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement), or rights or options to acquire any of our or our subsidiaries' securities (or beneficial ownership thereof), or any of our or our subsidiaries' or affiliates' assets, indebtedness or businesses, (b) any tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination involving us or any of our subsidiaries or affiliates or any assets constituting a significant portion of our consolidated assets, (c) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other extraordinary transaction with respect to us or any of our subsidiaries or affiliates, or (d) any "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are used in the proxy rules under the Exchange Act) or written consents with respect to any of our or our affiliates' voting securities. For this purpose, the term "affiliates" means our affiliates primarily engaged in the hospitality, lodging and/or gaming industries; 

&#8226; 

form, join or in any way participate in a "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) with respect to us where such group seeks to acquire any of our equity securities; 

&#8226; 

otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek representation on or to control or influence our or our subsidiaries' management, board of directors or policies; 

&#8226; 

take any action which would or would reasonably be expected to force us to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in the first bullet point above; 

&#8226; 

own more than 12% of the issued and outstanding common stock, unless such ownership arises as a result of any action not taken by or on behalf of such stockholder or a related person of such stockholder; or 

&#8226; 

request that we or any of our representatives, directly or indirectly, amend or waive any of the foregoing provisions. 

Each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement has also agreed that, if at any time during the period such stockholder is subject to the foregoing provisions, such stockholder is approached by any third party concerning its participation in any transaction or proposed transaction involving the acquisition of all or any portion of the assets, 

indebtedness or securities of, or any business of, ours or any of our subsidiaries, such stockholder will promptly inform us of the nature of such transaction and the parties involved. 

Termination 

The 2007 Stockholders' Agreement terminates (1) with respect to any individual stockholder, on the first date when such stockholder no longer holds any shares of common stock and (2) in its entirety, upon the first to occur of all of our equity securities being owned by a single person or the agreement in writing by us and each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement.
