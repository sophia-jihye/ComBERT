 

1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 

DCP Midstream Partners, LP, with its consolidated subsidiaries, or us, we, our or the Partnership, is engaged in the business of gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting, storing and selling natural gas; producing, fractionating, transporting, storing and selling NGLs and recovering and selling condensate; and transporting, storing and selling propane in wholesale markets. 

We are a Delaware limited partnership that was formed in August 2005. Our partnership includes our Natural Gas Services, NGL Logistics and Wholesale Propane Logistics segments. For additional information regarding these segments, see Note 18 &#32;- Business Segments. 

Our operations and activities are managed by our general partner, DCP Midstream GP, LP, which in turn is managed by its general partner, DCP Midstream GP, LLC, which we refer to as the General Partner, and is 100% &#32;owned by DCP Midstream, LLC. DCP Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively referred to as DCP Midstream, LLC, is owned 50% &#32;by Phillips 66 and 50% &#32;by Spectra Energy Corp and its affiliates, or Spectra Energy. DCP Midstream, LLC directs our business operations through its ownership and control of the General Partner. DCP Midstream, LLC&#8217;s employees provide administrative support to us and operate most of our assets. DCP Midstream, LLC owns approximately 21.4% &#32;of us, including limited partner and general partner interests. 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Partnership and all majority-owned subsidiaries where we have the ability to exercise control. Investments in greater than 20% &#32;owned affiliates that are not variable interest entities and where we do not have the ability to exercise control, and investments in less than 20% &#32;owned affiliates where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method. 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Transactions between us and other DCP Midstream, LLC operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements as transactions between affiliates. 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Use of Estimates &#32;- Conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes. Although these estimates are based on management&#8217;s best available knowledge of current and expected future events, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents - We consider investments in highly liquid financial instruments purchased with an original stated maturity of 90 days or less and temporary investments of cash in short-term money market securities to be cash equivalents. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts &#32;- Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non-collectability of accounts receivable generally based upon the number of days past due, past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. 

Inventories - Inventories, which consist primarily of NGLs and natural gas, are recorded at the lower of weighted-average cost or market value. Transportation costs are included in inventory. 

Accounting for Risk Management Activities and Financial Instruments &#32;- Non-trading energy commodity derivatives are designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or future cash flow (cash flow hedge), a hedge of a recognized asset, liability or firm commitment (fair value hedge), or normal purchases or normal sales. The remaining non-trading derivatives, which are related to asset-based activities for which the normal purchase or normal sale exception is not elected, are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets as unrealized gains or unrealized losses in derivative instruments, with changes in the fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. For each derivative, the accounting method and presentation of gains and losses or revenue and expense in the consolidated statements of operations are as follows:

&#32;______________ 

(a) 

Hedge method - An accounting method whereby the change in the fair value of the asset or liability is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as unrealized gains or unrealized losses on derivative instruments. For cash flow hedges, there is no recognition in the consolidated statements of operations for the effective portion until the service is provided or the associated delivery impacts earnings. For fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the asset or liability, as well as the offsetting changes in value of the hedged item, are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the same category as the related hedged item. 

(b) 

Accrual method - An accounting method whereby there is no recognition in the consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of operations for changes in fair value of a contract until the service is provided or the associated delivery impacts earnings. 

(c) 

Mark-to-market method - An accounting method whereby the change in the fair value of the asset or liability is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in gains and losses from commodity derivative activity during the current period. 

Cash Flow and Fair Value Hedges &#32;- For derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge, we maintain formal documentation of the hedge. In addition, we formally assess both at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis, whether the hedge contract is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. All components of each derivative gain or loss are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness, unless otherwise noted. 

The fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as unrealized gains or unrealized losses on derivative instruments. The change in fair value of the effective portion of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in partners&#8217; equity in accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, and the ineffective portion is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. During the period in which the hedged transaction impacts earnings, amounts in AOCI associated with the hedged transaction are reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations in the same line item as the item being hedged. Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge, or when it is probable that the hedged transaction will not occur. When hedge accounting is discontinued because the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge, the derivative is subject to the mark-to-market accounting method prospectively. The derivative continues to be carried on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value; however, subsequent changes in its fair value are recognized in current period earnings. Gains and losses related to discontinued hedges that were previously accumulated in AOCI will remain in AOCI until the hedged transaction impacts earnings, unless it is probable that the hedged transaction will not occur, in which case, the gains and losses that were previously deferred in AOCI will be immediately recognized in current period earnings. 

The fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge is recorded for balance sheet purposes as unrealized gains or unrealized losses on derivative instruments. We recognize the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item in earnings in the current period. All derivatives designated and accounted for as fair value hedges are classified in the same category as the item being hedged in the results of operations. 

Valuation &#32;- When available, quoted market prices or prices obtained through external sources are used to determine a contract&#8217;s fair value. For contracts with a delivery location or duration for which quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on pricing models developed primarily from historical relationships with quoted market prices and the expected relationship with quoted market prices. 

Values are adjusted to reflect the credit risk inherent in the transaction as well as the potential impact of liquidating open positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable time period under current conditions. Changes in market prices and management estimates directly affect the estimated fair value of these contracts. Accordingly, it is reasonably possible that such estimates may change in the near term.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 - (Continued) 

Property, Plant and Equipment &#32;- Property, plant and equipment are recorded at historical cost. The cost of maintenance and repairs, which are not significant improvements, are expensed when incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 

Capitalized Interest &#32; - We capitalize interest during construction of major projects. Interest is calculated on the monthly outstanding capital balance and ceases in the month that the asset is placed into service. We also capitalize interest on our equity method investments which are devoting substantially all efforts to establishing a new business and have not yet begun planned principal operations. Capitalization ceases when the investee commences planned principal operations. The rates used to calculate capitalized interest are the weighted-average cost of debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps. 

Asset Retirement Obligations &#32;- Our asset retirement obligations relate primarily to the retirement of various gathering pipelines and processing facilities, obligations related to right-of-way easement agreements, and contractual leases for land use. We adjust our asset retirement obligation each quarter for any liabilities incurred or settled during the period, accretion expense and any revisions made to the estimated cash flows. 

Asset retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets are recorded at fair value in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made, and added to the carrying amount of the associated asset. This additional carrying amount is then depreciated over the life of the asset. The liability is determined using a credit-adjusted risk free interest rate, and accretes due to the passage of time based on the time value of money until the obligation is settled. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets &#32;- Goodwill is the cost of an acquisition less the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business. We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at the reporting unit level during the third quarter, and update the test during interim periods when we believe events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of a reporting unit. We primarily use a discounted cash flow analysis, supplemented by a market approach analysis, to perform the assessment. Key assumptions in the analysis include the use of an appropriate discount rate, terminal year multiples, and estimated future cash flows including an estimate of operating and general and administrative costs. In estimating cash flows, we incorporate current market information, as well as historical and other factors, into our forecasted commodity prices. A prolonged period of lower commodity prices may adversely affect our estimate of future operating results, which could result in future goodwill and intangible assets impairment due to the potential impact on our operations and cash flows. 

Intangible assets consist of customer contracts, including commodity purchase, transportation and processing contracts, and related relationships. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of expected future benefit. Intangible assets are removed from the gross carrying amount and the total of accumulated amortization in the period in which they become fully amortized. 

Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates &#32;- We use the equity method to account for investments in greater than 20% owned affiliates that are not variable interest entities and where we do not have the ability to exercise control, and investments in less than 20% owned affiliates where we have the ability to exercise significant influence. 

We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such investments may have experienced a decline in value. When there is evidence of loss in value that is other than temporary, we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether impairment has occurred. We assess the fair value of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third party comparable sales and discounted cash flow models. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss. 

Long-Lived Assets &#32;- We periodically evaluate whether the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, has been impaired when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. This evaluation is based on undiscounted cash flow projections. The carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. We consider various factors when determining if these assets should be evaluated for impairment, including but not limited to: 

&#8226; 

significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate; 

&#8226; 

a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses, or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset; 

&#8226; 

an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset; 

DCP MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 - (Continued) 

&#8226; 

significant adverse changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or in its physical condition; 

&#8226; 

a significant adverse change in the market value of an asset; or 

&#8226; 

a current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life. 

If the carrying value is not recoverable, the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset&#8217;s carrying value over its fair value. We assess the fair value of long-lived assets using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third party comparable sales and discounted cash flow models. Significant changes in market conditions resulting from events such as the condition of an asset or a change in management&#8217;s intent to utilize the asset would generally require management to reassess the cash flows related to the long-lived assets. A prolonged period of lower commodity prices may adversely affect our estimate of future operating results, which could result in future impairment due to the potential impact on our operations and cash flows. 

Unamortized Debt Discount and Expense &#32;- Discounts and expenses incurred with the issuance of long-term debt are amortized over the term of the debt using the effective interest method. The discounts and unamortized expenses are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets within the carrying amount of long-term debt. 

Noncontrolling Interest &#32;- Noncontrolling interest represents any third party or affiliate interest in non-wholly owned entities that we consolidate. For financial reporting purposes, the assets and liabilities of these entities are consolidated with those of our own, with any third party or affiliate interest in our consolidated balance sheet amounts shown as noncontrolling interest in equity. Distributions to and contributions from noncontrolling interests represent cash payments to and cash contributions from, respectively, such third party and affiliate investors. 

Revenue Recognition &#32;- We generate the majority of our revenues from gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting, storing and selling of natural gas, and producing, fractionating, transporting, storing and selling NGLs and recovering and selling condensate. Once natural gas is produced from wells, producers then seek to deliver the natural gas and its components to end-use markets. We realize revenues either by selling the residue natural gas, NGLs and condensate, or by receiving fees. We also generate revenue from transporting, storing and selling propane. 

We obtain access to commodities and provide our midstream services principally under contracts that contain a combination of one or more of the following arrangements: 

&#8226; 

Fee-based arrangements - &#32;Under fee-based arrangements, we receive a fee or fees for one or more of the following services: gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting or storing natural gas; and fractionating, storing and transporting NGLs. Our fee-based arrangements include natural gas arrangements pursuant to which we obtain natural gas at the wellhead or other receipt points, at an index related price at the delivery point less a specified amount, generally the same as the transportation fees we would otherwise charge for transportation of natural gas from the wellhead location to the delivery point. The revenues we earn are directly related to the volume of natural gas or NGLs that flows through our systems and are not directly dependent on commodity prices. However, to the extent a sustained decline in commodity prices results in a decline in volumes, our revenues from these arrangements would be reduced. 

&#8226; 

Percent-of-proceeds/liquids arrangements &#32;- Under percent-of-proceeds arrangements, we generally purchase natural gas from producers at the wellhead, or other receipt points, gather the wellhead natural gas through our gathering system, treat and process the natural gas, and then sell the resulting residue natural gas, NGLs and condensate based on index prices from published index market prices. We remit to the producers either an agreed-upon percentage of the actual proceeds that we receive from our sales of the residue natural gas, NGLs and condensate, or an agreed-upon percentage of the proceeds based on index related prices for the natural gas, NGLs and condensate, regardless of the actual amount of the sales proceeds we receive. We keep the difference between the proceeds received and the amount remitted back to the producer. Under percent-of-liquids arrangements, we do not keep any amounts related to residue natural gas proceeds and only keep amounts related to the difference between the proceeds received and the amount remitted back to the producer related to NGLs and condensate. Certain of these arrangements may also result in the producer retaining title to all or a portion of the residue natural gas and/or the NGLs, in lieu of us returning sales proceeds to the producer. Additionally, these arrangements may include fee-based components. Our revenues under percent-of-proceeds arrangements relate directly with the price of natural gas, NGLs and condensate. Our revenues under percent-of-liquids arrangements relate directly with the price of NGLs and condensate.

Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 - (Continued) 

&#8226; 

Propane sales arrangements - Under propane sales arrangements, we generally purchase propane from natural gas processing plants and fractionation facilities, and crude oil refineries. We sell propane on a wholesale basis to propane distributors, who in turn resell to their customers. Our sales of propane are not contingent upon the resale of propane by propane distributors to their customers. 

Our marketing of natural gas and NGLs consists of physical purchases and sales, as well as positions in derivative instruments. 

We recognize revenues for sales and services under the four revenue recognition criteria, as follows: 

&#8226; 

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists &#32;- Our customary practice is to enter into a written contract. 

&#8226; 

Delivery &#32;- Delivery is deemed to have occurred at the time custody is transferred, or in the case of fee-based arrangements, when the services are rendered. To the extent we retain product as inventory, delivery occurs when the inventory is subsequently sold and custody is transferred to the third party purchaser. 

&#8226; 

The fee is fixed or determinable &#32;- We negotiate the fee for our services at the outset of our fee-based arrangements. In these arrangements, the fees are nonrefundable. For other arrangements, the amount of revenue, based on contractual terms, is determinable when the sale of the applicable product has been completed upon delivery and transfer of custody. 

&#8226; 

Collectability is reasonably assured &#32;- Collectability is evaluated on a customer-by-customer basis. New and existing customers are subject to a credit review process, which evaluates the customers&#8217; financial position (for example, credit metrics, liquidity and credit rating) and their ability to pay. If collectability is not considered probable at the outset of an arrangement in accordance with our credit review process, revenue is not recognized until the cash is collected. 

We generally report revenues gross in the consolidated statements of operations, &#32; as we typically act as the principal in these transactions, take custody to the product, and incur the risks and rewards of ownership. We recognize revenues for non-trading commodity derivative activity net in the consolidated statements of operations as gains and losses from commodity derivative activity . These activities include mark-to-market gains and losses on energy trading contracts and the settlement of financial and physical energy trading contracts. 

Quantities of natural gas or NGLs over-delivered or under-delivered related to imbalance agreements with customers, producers or pipelines are recorded monthly as accounts receivable or accounts payable using current market prices or the weighted-average prices of natural gas or NGLs at the plant or system. These balances are settled with deliveries of natural gas or NGLs, or with cash. 

Significant Customers &#32;- There were no third party customers that accounted for more than 10% &#32;of total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . We had significant transactions with affiliates. 

Environmental Expenditures &#32;- Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate, depending upon the future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not generate current or future revenue are expensed. Liabilities for these expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis when environmental assessments and/or clean-ups are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. There were no environmental liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheet as other current liabilities at December 31, 2015 and $1 million &#32;as of December 31, 2014, and other long-term liabilities were $1 million &#32;at both December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

Income Taxes &#32;- We are structured as a master limited partnership which is a pass-through entity for federal income tax purposes. Our income tax expense includes certain jurisdictions, including state, local, franchise and margin taxes of the master limited partnership and subsidiaries. We follow the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities. Our taxable income or loss, which may vary substantially from the net income or loss reported in the consolidated statements of operations, is proportionately included in the federal returns of each partner. 

Net Income or Loss per Limited Partner Unit &#32;- Basic and diluted net income or loss per limited partner unit, or LPU, is calculated by dividing net income or loss allocable to limited partners, by the weighted-average number of outstanding LPUs during the period. Diluted net income or loss per limited partner unit is computed based on the weighted average number of units plus the effect of dilutive potential units outstanding during the period using the two-class method.

3. New Accounting Pronouncements 

Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2015-16 &#8220;Business Combinations (Topic 805),&#8221; or ASU 2015-16 - In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, which requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. This ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with the option to early adopt for financial statements that have not been issued. We are currently evaluating the potential impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

FASB ASU, 2015-11 &#8220;Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,&#8221; or ASU 2015-11 - In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, which requires an entity to measure in scope inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The amendments apply to inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. This ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with the option to early adopt as of the beginning of an annual or interim period. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

FASB ASU 2015-06 &#8220;Earnings Per Share (Topic 260): Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown Transactions,&#8221; or ASU 2015-06 - In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-06, which specifies that for purposes of calculating historical earnings per unit under the two-class method, the earnings or losses of a transferred business before the date of a dropdown transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner. In that circumstance, the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners, which is typically the earnings per unit measure presented in the financial statements, would not change as a result of the dropdown transaction. This ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is required to be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this ASU will have no impact on our consolidated results of operations as we have not historically changed previously reported earnings per limited partner unit as a result of dropdown transactions. 

FASB ASU 2015-03 &#8220;Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Cost,&#8221; or ASU 2015-03 - In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability. The company adopted ASU 2015-03 on December 31, 2015 which required retrospective application to the 2014 consolidated balance sheet. As a result of the adoption, $14 million &#32;of debt issuance costs was recorded as a deduction from long-term debt as of December 31, 2015, and $17 million &#32;was reclassified from other long-term assets to long-term debt as of December 31, 2014, respectively. 

FASB ASU 2015-02 &#8220;Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,&#8221; or ASU 2015-02 - In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, which changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and we are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this ASU on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 

FASB ASU 2014-09 &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),&#8221; or ASU 2014-09 - In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 605 &#8220;Revenue Recognition.&#8221; This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with the option to adopt as early as December 15, 2016. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this ASU on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 

4. Acquisitions 

On January 1, 2015, we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of Enterprise Products Partners L.P., or Enterprise, to acquire a 15% &#32;ownership interest in Panola Pipeline Company, LLC, or Panola. At closing, we paid $1 million &#32;for our interest in the joint venture. The anticipated total consideration of approximately $26 million &#32;includes our proportionate share in construction costs for an expansion of the existing Panola NGL pipeline. The Panola NGL pipeline originates in Carthage, Texas and extends approximately 180 &#32;miles to Mont Belvieu, Texas. The expansion will extend the Panola NGL pipeline for approximately 60 &#32;miles and increase capacity from approximately 50 &#32;MBbls/d to 100 &#32;MBbls/d. We along with, affiliates of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, and MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P. each own a 15% &#32;interest in Panola. Enterprise owns a

55% &#32;interest in Panola and is constructing the expansion and will operate the pipeline. In accordance with the Panola joint venture agreement, earnings began to accrue on February 1, 2016.

5 . Agreements and Transactions with Affiliates 

DCP Midstream, LLC 

Services Agreement and Other General and Administrative Charges 

We have entered into a services agreement, as amended, or the Services Agreement, with DCP Midstream, LLC. Under the Services Agreement, we are required to reimburse DCP Midstream, LLC for salaries of operating personnel and employee benefits, as well as capital expenditures, maintenance and repair costs, taxes and other direct costs incurred by DCP Midstream, LLC on our behalf. We also pay DCP Midstream, LLC an annual fee under the Services Agreement for centralized corporate functions performed by DCP Midstream, LLC on our behalf, including legal, accounting, cash management, insurance administration and claims processing, risk management, health, safety and environmental, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, taxes and engineering. Except with respect to the annual fee, there is no limit on the reimbursements we make to DCP Midstream, LLC under the Services Agreement for other expenses and expenditures incurred or payments made on our behalf. In the event we acquire assets or our business otherwise expands, the annual fee under the Services Agreement is subject to adjustment based on the nature and extent of general and administrative services performed by DCP Midstream, LLC, as well as an annual adjustment based on changes to the Consumer Price Index. &#32; 

On February 23, 2015, the annual fee payable under the Services Agreement was increased to $71 million , following approval of the increase by the special committee of the board of directors of the General Partner. Our growth, both from organic growth and acquisitions, has resulted in the Partnership becoming a much larger portion of the business of DCP Midstream, LLC. Additionally, our expansion into downstream logistics has required DCP Midstream, LLC to expand its capabilities and provide us with a broader range of services than what was previously provided. As a result, DCP Midstream, LLC initiated a comprehensive review of its costs and the methodology for allocating general and administrative services. The result of this review reflects the level and cost of general and administrative services provided to us by DCP Midstream, LLC as the operator of our assets. The annual fee was effective starting January 1, 2015. 

The following is a summary of the fees we incurred under the Services Agreement, as well as other fees paid to DCP Midstream, LLC:

Other Agreements and Transactions with DCP Midstream, LLC 

As a result of assets contributed to us by DCP Midstream, LLC, we have previously entered into derivative transactions directly with DCP Midstream, LLC whereby DCP Midstream, LLC was the counterparty. In March 2015, DCP Midstream, LLC novated those fixed price derivatives and our counterparty is now one of the financial institutions associated with our credit facility. Accordingly, the counterparties to the majority of our commodity swap contracts are investment-grade rated financial institutions. 

In conjunction with our acquisition of the O'Connor, Lucerne 1, and Lucerne 2 plants, we entered into long-term fee-based processing agreements with DCP Midstream, LLC pursuant to which DCP Midstream, LLC agreed to pay us (i) a fixed demand charge on a portion of the plants' capacities, and (ii) a throughput fee on all volumes processed for DCP Midstream, LLC at the plants. &#32;We report revenues associated with these activities in the consolidated statements of operations as transportation, processing and other to affiliates. Under these agreements in our DJ Basin system we received fees of $71 million , $45 million &#32;and $6 million &#32;during the years ended &#32; December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 respectively.

DCP MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 - (Continued) 

Depreciation expense was $110 million , $101 million &#32;and $87 million &#32;for the years ended &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

During the years ended &#32; December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we discontinued certain construction projects and wrote off approximately $9 million , $3 million , $8 million , respectively, in construction work in progress to other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 

Asset Retirement Obligations &#32;- As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we had asset retirement obligations of $29 million &#32;and $27 million , respectively, included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Accretion expense was $2 million , $2 million , and $1 million &#32;for the years ended &#32; December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

We identified various assets as having an indeterminate life, for which there is no requirement to establish a fair value for future retirement obligations associated with such assets. These assets include certain pipelines, gathering systems and processing facilities. A liability for these asset retirement obligations will be recorded only if and when a future retirement obligation with a determinable life is identified. These assets have an indeterminate life because they are owned and will operate for an indeterminate future period when properly maintained. Additionally, if the portion of an owned plant containing asbestos were to be modified or dismantled, we would be legally required to remove the asbestos. We currently have no plans to take actions that would require the removal of the asbestos in these assets. Accordingly, the fair value of the asset retirement obligation related to this asbestos cannot be estimated and no obligation has been recorded. 

8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

Goodwill is the cost of an acquisition less the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business. We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill in the third quarter, and update the test during interim periods when we believe events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of a reporting unit. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, we determined that continued weak commodity prices caused a change in circumstances warranting an interim impairment test. 

Using the fair value approaches described within the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we determined that the estimated fair value of our Collbran, Michigan and Southeast Texas reporting units, all of which are included in our Natural Gas Services reporting segment, was less than the carrying amount, primarily due to changes in assumptions related to commodity prices and discount rate. 

We then allocated the estimated fair value of the reporting unit among all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in a hypothetical purchase price allocation. During the second quarter of 2015, we recognized a goodwill impairment based on our best estimate of the impairment resulting from the performance of the hypothetical purchase price allocation which totaled $49 million &#32;from our Collbran, Michigan, and Southeast Texas reporting units. We completed the hypothetical purchase price allocation in the third quarter of 2015 and after completing the analysis, there was no remaining fair value to assign to the goodwill of the Collbran reporting unit. As a result, we recorded an additional impairment of $33 million &#32;in the third quarter of 2015. 

We performed our annual goodwill assessment during the quarter ended September 30, 2015. We concluded that the fair value of goodwill of our remaining reporting units exceeded their carrying value, and the entire amount of goodwill disclosed on the condensed consolidated balance sheet associated with these remaining reporting units is recoverable, therefore, no other goodwill impairments were identified or recorded for the remaining reporting units as a result of our annual goodwill assessment. 

Our impairment determinations involved significant assumptions and judgments, as discussed within the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Differing assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to additional goodwill impairment charges, which would be recognized in the period in which the carrying value exceeds fair value. Adverse changes in our business or the overall operating environment such as declines in gas production volumes, loss of significant customers or a further or sustained decrease in commodity prices may adversely affect our estimate of future operating results, which could result in future goodwill impairment charges for other reporting units due to the potential impact on our operations and cash flows.

10. Fair Value Measurement 

Determination of Fair Value 

Below is a general description of our valuation methodologies for derivative financial assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value. Fair values are generally based upon quoted market prices or prices obtained through external sources, where available. If listed market prices or quotes are not available, we determine fair value based upon a market quote, adjusted by other market-based or independently sourced market data such as historical commodity volatilities, crude oil future yield curves, and/or counterparty specific considerations. These adjustments result in a fair value for each asset or liability under an &#8220;exit price&#8221; methodology, in line with how we believe a marketplace participant would value that asset or liability. Fair values are adjusted to reflect the credit risk inherent in the transaction as well as the potential impact of liquidating open positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable time period under current conditions. These adjustments may include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality, the effect of our own creditworthiness, the time value of money and/or the liquidity of the market. 

&#8226; 

Counterparty credit valuation adjustments are necessary when the market price of an instrument is not indicative of the fair value as a result of the credit quality of the counterparty. Generally, market quotes assume that all counterparties have near zero, or low, default rates and have equal credit quality. Therefore, an adjustment may be necessary to reflect the credit quality of a specific counterparty to determine the fair value of the instrument. We record counterparty credit valuation adjustments on all derivatives that are in a net asset position as of the measurement date in accordance with our established counterparty credit policy, which takes into account any collateral margin that a counterparty may have posted with us as well as any letters of credit that they have provided. 

&#8226; 

Entity valuation adjustments are necessary to reflect the effect of our own credit quality on the fair value of our net liability positions with each counterparty. This adjustment takes into account any credit enhancements, such as collateral margin we may have posted with a counterparty, as well as any letters of credit that we have provided. The methodology to determine this adjustment is consistent with how we evaluate counterparty credit risk, taking into account our own credit rating, current credit spreads, as well as any change in such spreads since the last measurement date. 

DCP MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 - (Continued) 

&#8226; 

Liquidity valuation adjustments are necessary when we are not able to observe a recent market price for financial instruments that trade in less active markets for the fair value to reflect the cost of exiting the position. Exchange traded contracts are valued at market value without making any additional valuation adjustments and, therefore, no liquidity reserve is applied. For contracts other than exchange traded instruments, we mark our positions to the midpoint of the bid/ask spread, and record a liquidity reserve based upon our total net position. We believe that such practice results in the most reliable fair value measurement as viewed by a market participant. 

We manage our derivative instruments on a portfolio basis and the valuation adjustments described above are calculated on this basis. We believe that the portfolio level approach represents the highest and best use for these assets as there are benefits inherent in naturally offsetting positions within the portfolio at any given time, and this approach is consistent with how a market participant would view and value the assets and liabilities. Although we take a portfolio approach to managing these assets/liabilities, in order to reflect the fair value of any one individual contract within the portfolio, we allocate all valuation adjustments down to the contract level, to the extent deemed necessary, based upon either the notional contract volume, or the contract value, whichever is more applicable. 

&#160; 

The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While we believe that our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, we recognize that the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. We review our fair value policies on a regular basis taking into consideration changes in the marketplace and, if necessary, will adjust our policies accordingly. See Note 12 &#32;- Risk Management and Hedging Activities. 

Valuation Hierarchy 

Our fair value measurements are grouped into a three-level valuation hierarchy. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows. 

&#8226; 

Level 1 &#8212; inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical &#32;assets or liabilities in active markets. 

&#8226; 

Level 2 &#8212; inputs include quoted prices for similar &#32;assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

&#8226; 

Level 3 &#8212; inputs are unobservable and considered significant to the fair value measurement. 

A financial instrument&#8217;s categorization within the hierarchy is based upon the level of judgment involved in the most significant input in the determination of the instrument&#8217;s fair value. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the hierarchy. 

Commodity Derivative Assets and Liabilities 

We enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments, which may include over-the-counter, or OTC, instruments, such as natural gas, crude oil or NGL contracts. 

Within our Natural Gas Services segment, we typically use OTC derivative contracts in order to mitigate a portion of our exposure to natural gas, NGL and condensate price changes. We also may enter into natural gas derivatives to lock in margin around our storage and transportation assets. These instruments are generally classified as Level 2. Depending upon market conditions and our strategy, we may enter into OTC derivative positions with a significant time horizon to maturity, and market prices for these OTC derivatives may only be readily observable for a portion of the duration of the instrument. In order to calculate the fair value of these instruments, readily observable market information is utilized to the extent that it is available; however, in the event that readily observable market data is not available, we may interpolate or extrapolate based upon observable data. In instances where we utilize an interpolated or extrapolated value, and it is considered significant to the valuation of the contract as a whole, we would classify the instrument within Level 3. 

DCP MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 - (Continued) 

Within our Wholesale Propane Logistics segment, we may enter into a variety of financial instruments to either secure sales or purchase prices, or capture a variety of market opportunities. Since financial instruments for NGLs tend to be counterparty and location specific, we primarily use the OTC derivative instrument markets, which are not as active and liquid as exchange traded instruments. Market quotes for such contracts may only be available for short dated positions (up to six months), and an active market itself may not exist beyond such time horizon. Contracts entered into with a relatively short time horizon for which prices are readily observable in the OTC market are generally classified within Level 2. Contracts with a longer time horizon, for which we internally generate a forward curve to value such instruments, are generally classified within Level 3. The internally generated curve may utilize a variety of assumptions including, but not limited to, data obtained from third party pricing services, historical and future expected relationship of NGL prices to crude oil prices, the knowledge of expected supply sources coming on line, expected weather trends within certain regions of the United States, and the future expected demand for NGLs. 

Each instrument is assigned to a level within the hierarchy at the end of each financial quarter depending upon the extent to which the valuation inputs are observable. Generally, an instrument will move toward a level within the hierarchy that requires a lower degree of judgment as the time to maturity approaches, and as the markets in which the asset trades will likely become more liquid and prices more readily available in the market, thus reducing the need to rely upon our internally developed assumptions. However, the level of a given instrument may change, in either direction, depending upon market conditions and the availability of market observable data. 

&#160; 

Interest Rate Derivative Assets and Liabilities 

We may use interest rate swap agreements as part of our overall capital strategy. These instruments would effectively exchange a portion of our existing floating rate debt for fixed-rate debt. Historically, our swaps have been generally priced based upon a London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, instrument with similar duration, adjusted by the credit spread between our company and the LIBOR instrument. Given that a portion of the swap value is derived from the credit spread, which may be observed by comparing similar assets in the market, these instruments are classified within Level 2. Default risk on either side of the swap transaction is also considered in the valuation. We record counterparty credit and entity valuation adjustments in the valuation of our interest rate swaps; however, these reserves are not considered to be a significant input to the overall valuation. 

Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities 

We utilize fair value to perform impairment tests as required on our property, plant and equipment; goodwill; and long-lived intangible assets. Assets and liabilities acquired in third party business combinations are recorded at their fair value as of the date of acquisition. The inputs used to determine such fair value are primarily based upon internally developed cash flow models and would generally be classified within Level 3 in the event that we were required to measure and record such assets at fair value within our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we use fair value to determine the inception value of our asset retirement obligations. The inputs used to determine such fair value are primarily based upon costs incurred historically for similar work, as well as estimates from independent third parties for costs that would be incurred to restore leased property to the contractually stipulated condition, and would generally be classified within Level 3. 

For the year ended &#32; December 31, 2015 , we recognized goodwill impairment of $82 million &#32;in our consolidated statements of operations. Our impairment determinations involved significant assumptions and judgments. Differing assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations. As such, the fair value measurements utilized within these models are classified as non-recurring Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy because they are not observable from objective sources.

Changes in Levels 1 and 2 Fair Value Measurements 

The determination to classify a financial instrument within Level 1 or Level 2 is based upon the availability of quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in active markets. Depending upon the information readily observable in the market, and/or the use of identical or similar quoted prices, which are significant to the overall valuation, the classification of any individual financial instrument may differ from one measurement date to the next. To qualify as a transfer, the asset or liability must have existed in the previous reporting period and moved into a different level during the current period. In the event that there is a movement between the classification of an instrument as Level 1 or 2, the transfer would be reflected in a table as Transfers into or out of Level 1 and Level 2. During the years ended &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , there were no transfers into or out of Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Changes in Level 3 Fair Value Measurements 

The tables below illustrate a rollforward of the amounts included in our consolidated balance sheets for derivative financial instruments that we have classified within Level 3. Since financial instruments classified as Level 3 typically include a combination of observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) and unobservable components, the gains and losses in the table below may include changes in fair value due in part to observable market factors, or changes to our assumptions on the unobservable components. Depending upon the information readily observable in the market, and/or the use of unobservable inputs, which are significant to the overall valuation, the classification of any individual financial instrument may differ from one measurement date to the next. The significant unobservable inputs used in determining fair value include adjustments by other market-based or independently sourced market data such as historical commodity volatilities, crude oil future yield curves, and/or counterparty specific considerations. In the event that there is a movement to/from the classification of an instrument as Level 3, we would reflect such items in the table below within the &#8220;Transfers into/out of Level 3&#8221; captions. 

We manage our overall risk at the portfolio level and in the execution of our strategy, we may use a combination of financial instruments, which may be classified within any level. Since Level 1 and Level 2 risk management instruments are not included in the rollforward below, the gains or losses in the table do not reflect the effect of our total risk management activities.

Quantitative Information and Fair Value Sensitivities Related to Level 3 Unobservable Inputs 

We utilize the market approach to measure the fair value of our commodity contracts. The significant unobservable inputs used in this approach to fair value are longer dated price quotes. Our sensitivity to these longer dated forward curve prices are presented in the table below. Significant changes in any of those inputs in isolation would result in significantly different fair value measurements, depending on our short or long position in contracts.

Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

Valuation of a contract&#8217;s fair value is validated by an internal group independent of the marketing group. While common industry practices are used to develop valuation techniques, changes in pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values and income recognition. When available, quoted market prices or prices obtained through external sources are used to determine a contract&#8217;s fair value. For contracts with a delivery location or duration for which quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on pricing models developed primarily from historical and expected relationship with quoted market prices. 

Values are adjusted to reflect the credit risk inherent in the transaction as well as the potential impact of liquidating open positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable time period under current conditions. Changes in market prices and management estimates directly affect the estimated fair value of these contracts. Accordingly, it is reasonably possible that such estimates may change in the near term.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 - (Continued) 

The fair value of our interest rate swaps, if any, and commodity non-trading derivatives is based on prices supported by quoted market prices and other external sources and prices based on models and other valuation methods. The &#8220;prices supported by quoted market prices and other external sources&#8221; category includes our interest rate swaps, if any, our NGL and crude oil swaps and our NYMEX positions in natural gas. In addition, this category includes our forward positions in natural gas for which our forward price curves are obtained from a third party pricing service and then validated through an internal process which includes the use of independent broker quotes. This category also includes our forward positions in NGLs at points for which OTC broker quotes for similar assets or liabilities are available for the full term of the instrument. This category also includes &#8220;strip&#8221; transactions whose pricing inputs are directly or indirectly observable from external sources and then modeled to daily or monthly prices as appropriate. The &#8220;prices based on models and other valuation methods&#8221; category includes the value of transactions for which inputs to the fair value of the instrument are unobservable in the marketplace and are considered significant to the overall fair value of the instrument. The fair value of these instruments may be based upon an internally developed price curve, which was constructed as a result of the long dated nature of the transaction or the illiquidity of the specific market point. 

We have determined fair value amounts using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. 

The fair value of accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings are not materially different from their carrying amounts because of the short-term nature of these instruments or the stated rates approximating market rates. Derivative instruments are carried at fair value. 

&#32;We determine the fair value of our fixed-rate Senior Notes based on quotes obtained from bond dealers. We determine the fair value of borrowings under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement based upon the discounted present value of expected future cash flows, taking into account the difference between the contractual borrowing spread and the spread for similar credit facilities available in the marketplace. We classify the fair values of our outstanding debt balances within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the carrying value and fair value of our long-term fixed-rate Senior Notes, including current maturities, and our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement were as follows:

Amended and Restated Credit Agreement 

On May 1, 2014, we entered into a $1.25 billion &#32;amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit agreement that matures on May 1, 2019 , or the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is used for working capital requirements and other general partnership purposes including acquisitions. 

&#32;Our cost of borrowing under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is determined by a ratings-based pricing grid. Indebtedness under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement bears interest at either: (1) LIBOR, plus an applicable margin of 1.275% &#32;based on our current credit rating; or (2) (a) the base rate which shall be the higher of Wells Fargo Bank N.A.&#8217;s prime rate, the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.50% &#32;or the LIBOR Market Index rate, plus 1% , plus (b) an applicable margin of 0.275% &#32;based on our current credit rating. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement incurs an annual facility fee of 0.225% &#32;based on our current credit rating. This fee is paid on drawn and undrawn portions of the $1.25 billion &#32;Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had unused borrowing capacity of $874 million , net of letters of credit, under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, all of which was available for working capital and other general partnership purposes. Our borrowing capacity may be limited by financial covenants set forth in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Except in the case of a default, amounts borrowed under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement will not become due prior to the May 1, 2019 &#32;maturity date. 

The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a leverage ratio (the ratio of our consolidated indebtedness to our consolidated EBITDA, in each case as is defined by the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) of not more than 5.0 &#32;to 1.0 , and following the consummation of qualifying acquisitions, not more than 5.5 &#32;to 1.0 , on a temporary basis for three consecutive quarters, including the quarter in which such acquisition is consummated.

12 . Risk Management and Hedging Activities 

Our day-to-day operations expose us to a variety of risks including but not limited to changes in the prices of commodities that we buy or sell, changes in interest rates, and the creditworthiness of each of our counterparties. We manage certain of these exposures with either physical or financial transactions. We have established a comprehensive risk management policy and a risk management committee, or the Risk Management Committee, to monitor and manage market risks associated with commodity prices and counterparty credit. The Risk Management Committee is composed of senior executives who receive regular briefings on positions and exposures, credit exposures and overall risk management in the context of market activities. The Risk Management Committee is responsible for the overall management of credit risk and commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits. The following describes each of the risks that we manage. 

Commodity Price Risk 

Cash Flow Protection Activities &#32;&#8212; We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of natural gas, NGLs and condensate as a result of our gathering, processing, sales and storage activities. For gathering, processing and storage services, we may receive cash or commodities as payment for these services, depending on the contract type. We enter into derivative financial instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk of weakening natural gas, NGL and condensate prices associated with our gathering, processing and sales activities, thereby stabilizing our cash flows. We have mitigated a portion of our expected commodity price risk associated with our gathering, processing and sales activities through 2017 with commodity derivative instruments, with the majority of our positions settling through the first quarter of 2016 . Our commodity derivative instruments used for our hedging program are a combination of direct NGL product, crude oil, and natural gas hedges. Due to the limited liquidity and tenor of the NGL derivative market, we have used crude oil swaps and costless collars to mitigate a portion of our commodity price exposure to NGLs. Historically, prices of NGLs have generally been related to crude oil prices; however, there are periods of time when NGL pricing may be at a greater discount to crude oil, resulting in additional exposure to NGL commodity prices. The relationship of NGLs to crude oil continues to be lower than historical relationships; however, a significant amount of our NGL hedges through the first quarter of 2016 are direct product hedges. When our crude oil swaps become short-term in nature, we have periodically converted certain crude oil derivatives to NGL derivatives by entering into offsetting crude oil swaps while adding NGL swaps. Our crude oil and NGL transactions are primarily accomplished through the use of forward contracts that effectively exchange our floating price risk for a fixed price. We also utilize crude oil costless collars that minimize our floating price risk by establishing a fixed price floor and a fixed price ceiling. However, the type of instrument that we use to mitigate a portion of our risk may vary depending upon our risk management objective. These transactions are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and the change in fair value is reflected within our consolidated statements of operations as a gain or a loss on commodity derivative activity. 

&#160; 

Our Wholesale Propane Logistics segment is generally designed with the intent to establish stable margins by entering into supply arrangements that specify prices based on established floating price indices and by entering into sales agreements that provide for floating prices that are tied to our variable supply costs plus a margin. To the extent possible, we match the pricing of our supply portfolio to our sales portfolio in order to lock in value and reduce our overall commodity price risk. However, to the extent that we carry propane inventories or our sales and supply arrangements are not aligned, we are exposed 

DCP MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 - (Continued) 

to market variables and commodity price risk. We manage the commodity price risk of our supply portfolio and sales portfolio with both physical and financial transactions, including fixed price sales. While the majority of our sales and purchases in this segment are index-based, occasionally, we may enter into fixed price sales agreements in the event that a propane distributor desires to purchase propane from us on a fixed price basis. In such cases, we may manage this risk with derivatives that allow us to swap our fixed price risk to market index prices that are matched to our market index supply costs. In addition, we may use financial derivatives to manage the value of our propane inventories. These transactions are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and any change in fair value is reflected in the current period within our consolidated statements of operations as a gain or loss on commodity derivative activity. 

Our portfolio of commodity derivative activity is primarily accounted for using the mark-to-market method of accounting, whereby changes in fair value are recorded directly to the consolidated statements of operations; however, depending upon our risk profile and objectives, in certain limited cases, we may execute transactions that qualify for the hedge method of accounting. 

As a result of assets contributed to us by DCP Midstream, LLC, we have previously entered into derivative transactions directly with DCP Midstream, LLC whereby DCP Midstream, LLC was the counterparty. In March 2015, DCP Midstream, LLC novated those fixed price derivatives and our counterparty is now one of the financial institutions associated with our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Accordingly, the counterparties to the majority of our commodity swap contracts are investment-grade rated financial institutions. 

Natural Gas Storage and Pipeline Asset Based Commodity Derivative Program &#32;&#8212; Our natural gas storage and pipeline assets are exposed to certain risks including changes in commodity prices. We manage commodity price risk related to our natural gas storage and pipeline assets through our commodity derivative program. The commercial activities related to our natural gas storage and pipeline assets primarily consist of the purchase and sale of gas and associated time spreads and basis spreads. 

A time spread transaction is executed by establishing a long gas position at one point in time and establishing an equal short gas position at a different point in time. Time spread transactions allow us to lock in a margin supported by the injection, withdrawal, and storage capacity of our natural gas storage assets. We may execute basis spread transactions to mitigate the risk of sale and purchase price differentials across our system. A basis spread transaction allows us to lock in a margin on our physical purchases and sales of gas, including injections and withdrawals from storage. We typically use swaps to execute these transactions, which are not designated as hedging instruments and are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the current period consolidated statements of operations. While gas held in our storage locations is recorded at the lower of average cost or market, the derivative instruments that are used to manage our storage facilities are recorded at fair value and any changes in fair value are currently recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. Even though we may have economically hedged our exposure and locked in a future margin, the use of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting for our physical inventory and the use of mark-to-market accounting for our derivative instruments may subject our earnings to market volatility. 

Commodity Cash Flow Hedges &#32;&#8212; In order for storage facilities to remain operational, a minimum level of base gas must be maintained in each storage cavern, which is capitalized on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of property, plant and equipment, net. During construction or expansion of our storage caverns, we may execute a series of derivative financial instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with the forecasted purchase of natural gas when we bring the storage caverns to operation. These derivative financial instruments may be designated as cash flow hedges. While the cash paid upon settlement of these hedges economically fixes the cash required to purchase the base gas, the deferred losses or gains would remain in accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, until the cavern is emptied and the base gas is sold. The balance in AOCI of our previously settled base gas cash flow hedges was in a loss position of $6 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . 

Interest Rate Risk 

We enter into debt arrangements that have either fixed or floating rates, therefore we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. We periodically use interest rate swaps to convert our floating rate debt to fixed-rate debt or to convert our fixed-rate debt to floating rate debt. Our primary goals include: (1) maintaining an appropriate ratio of fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt; (2) reducing volatility of earnings resulting from interest rate fluctuations; and (3) locking in attractive interest rates. 

In conjunction with the issuance of our 4.95% &#32;Senior Notes in March 2012, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to market rate fluctuations prior to issuance. These derivative financial instruments

Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 - (Continued) 

were designated as cash flow hedges. While the cash paid upon settlement of these hedges economically fixed the rate we would pay on a portion of our 4.95% &#32;Senior Notes, the deferred loss in AOCI will be amortized into interest expense through the maturity of the notes in 2022. The balance in AOCI of these cash flow hedges was in a loss position of $3 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . 

Contingent Credit Features 

Each of the above risks is managed through the execution of individual contracts with a variety of counterparties. Certain of our derivative contracts may contain credit-risk related contingent provisions that may require us to take certain actions in certain circumstances. 

We have International Swaps and Derivatives Association, or ISDA, contracts which are standardized master legal arrangements that establish key terms and conditions which govern certain derivative transactions. These ISDA contracts contain standard credit-risk related contingent provisions. Some of the provisions we are subject to are outlined below. 

&#8226; 

If we were to have an effective event of default under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that occurs and is continuing, our ISDA counterparties may have the right to request early termination and net settlement of any outstanding derivative liability positions. 

&#8226; 

Our ISDA counterparties generally have collateral thresholds of zero, requiring us to fully collateralize any commodity contracts in a net liability position, when our credit rating is below investment grade. 

&#8226; 

Additionally, in some cases, our ISDA contracts contain cross-default provisions that could constitute a credit-risk related contingent feature. These provisions apply if we default in making timely payments under other credit arrangements and the amount of the default is above certain predefined thresholds, which are significantly high and are generally consistent with the terms of our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2015 , we were not a party to any agreements that would trigger the cross-default provisions. 

Our commodity derivative contracts that are not governed by ISDA contracts do not have any credit-risk related contingent features. 

Depending upon the movement of commodity prices and interest rates, each of our individual contracts with counterparties to our commodity derivative instruments or to our interest rate swap instruments are in either a net asset or net liability position. As of December 31, 2015 , all of our individual commodity derivative contracts that contain credit-risk related contingent features were in a net asset position. If we were required to net settle our position with an individual counterparty, due to a credit-risk related event, our ISDA contracts may permit us to net all outstanding contracts with that counterparty, whether in a net asset or net liability position, as well as any cash collateral already posted. As of December 31, 2015 , we were not required to post additional collateral or offset net liability contracts with contracts in a net asset position because all of our commodity derivative contracts that contain credit-risk related contingent features were in a net asset position. 

Offsetting 

Certain of our derivative instruments are subject to a master netting or similar arrangement, whereby we may elect to settle multiple positions with an individual counterparty through a single net payment. Each of our individual derivative instruments are presented on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets, regardless of our ability to net settle our positions. Instruments that are governed by agreements that include net settle provisions allow final settlement, when presented with a termination event, of outstanding amounts by extinguishing the mutual debts owed between the parties in exchange for a net amount due. We have trade receivables and payables associated with derivative instruments, subject to master netting or similar agreements, which are not included in the table below. The following summarizes the gross and net amounts of our derivative instruments:

13 . Partnership Equity and Distributions 

In April 2015, we filed a new shelf registration statement with the SEC, that became effective upon filing, in order to replace an existing shelf registration statement that was set to expire. As with the prior shelf registration statement, the new shelf registration statement also allows us to issue an unlimited amount of common units and debt securities. We have issued no common units or debt securities under this registration statement. &#32; 

During the year ended &#32; December 31, 2015 , we issued 788,033 &#32;common units pursuant to our 2014 equity distribution agreement and received proceeds of $31 million , net of commissions and offering costs of less than $1 million , which were used to finance growth opportunities and for general partnership purposes. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately $349 million &#32;of common units remained available for sale pursuant to our 2014 equity distribution agreement. 

In June 2014, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC with a maximum offering price of $500 million , which became effective on July 11, 2014. The shelf registration statement allows us to issue additional common units. In September 2014, we entered into an equity distribution agreement, or the 2014 equity distribution agreement, with a group of financial institutions as sales agents. The 2014 equity distribution agreement provides for the offer and sale from time to time, through our sales agents, of common units having an aggregate offering amount of up to $500 million . During the year ended December 31, 2014, we issued 2,256,066 &#32;of our common units pursuant to the 2014 equity distribution agreement and received proceeds of $119 million , net of commissions and accrued offering costs of $1 million , which were used to finance growth opportunities and for general partnership purposes. 

In March 2014, we issued 14,375,000 &#32;common units to the public at $48.90 &#32;per unit. We received proceeds of $677 million , net of offering costs. 

In March 2014, we issued 4,497,158 &#32;common units to DCP Midstream, LLC as partial consideration for the March 2014 Transactions. 

In August 2013, we issued 9,000,000 &#32;common units to the public at $50.04 &#32;per unit. We received proceeds of $434 million , net of offering costs. 

In June 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, or the June 2013 shelf registration statement, with the SEC with a maximum offering price of $300 million , which became effective on June 27, 2013. The June 2013 shelf registration statement allowed us to issue additional common units. In November 2013, we entered into an equity distribution agreement related to the June 2013 shelf registration statement, or the 2013 equity distribution agreement, with a group of financial institutions as sales agents. The 2013 equity distribution agreement provided for the offer and sale from time to time, through our sales agents, of common units having an aggregate offering amount of up to $300 million . During the year ended December 31, 2014, we issued 3,769,635 &#32;common units pursuant to the 2013 equity distribution agreement and received proceeds of $206 million , which is net of commissions and offering costs of $2 million . During the year ended December 31, 2013, we issued 1,839,430 &#32;of our common units pursuant to the 2013 equity distribution agreement and received proceeds of $87 million , net of commissions and offering costs of $1 million . The proceeds were used to finance growth opportunities and for general partnership purposes. In connection with our entry into the 2014 equity distribution agreement, we terminated the 2013 equity distribution agreement in September 2014. In October 2014, we de-registered the common units that remained unsold under the 2013 equity distribution agreement at the time of its termination. 

In March 2013, we issued 2,789,739 &#32;common units to DCP Midstream, LLC as partial consideration for 46.67% &#32;interest in the Eagle Ford system. 

In March 2013, we issued 12,650,000 &#32;common units to the public at $40.63 &#32;per unit. We received proceeds of $494 million , net of offering costs. 

Definition of Available Cash &#8212; Our partnership agreement requires that, within 45 &#32;days after the end of each quarter, we distribute all of our Available Cash, as defined in the partnership agreement, to unitholders of record on the applicable record date, as determined by our general partner. Available Cash, for any quarter, consists of all cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of that quarter: 

&#8226; 

less the amount of cash reserves established by the general partner to: 

&#8226; provide for the proper conduct of our business; 

&#8226; comply with applicable law, any of our debt instruments or other agreements; and 

DCP MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 - (Continued) 

&#8226; 

provide funds for distributions to the unitholders and to our general partner for any one or more of the next four quarters; 

&#8226; 

plus, if our general partner so determines, all or a portion of cash and cash equivalents on hand on the date of determination of Available Cash for the quarter. 

General Partner Interest and Incentive Distribution Rights &#32;- &#32;The general partner is entitled to a percentage of all quarterly distributions equal to its general partner interest of approximately 0.3% &#32;and limited partner interest of approximately 1.7% &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . The general partner has the right, but not the obligation, to contribute a proportionate amount of capital to us to maintain its current general partner interest. 

The incentive distribution rights held by the general partner entitle it to receive an increasing share of Available Cash when pre-defined distribution targets are achieved. Currently, our distribution to our general partner related to its incentive distribution rights is at the highest level. The general partner&#8217;s incentive distribution rights were not reduced as a result of our common unit issuances, and will not be reduced if we issue additional units in the future and the general partner does not contribute a proportionate amount of capital to us to maintain its current general partner interest. Please read the Distributions of Available Cash &#32;sections below for more details about the distribution targets and their impact on the general partner&#8217;s incentive distribution rights. 

Distributions of Available Cash - Our partnership agreement, after adjustment for the general partner&#8217;s relative ownership level, requires that we make distributions of Available Cash from operating surplus for any quarter in the following manner: 

&#8226; 

first, &#32;to all unitholders and the general partner, in accordance with their pro rata interest, until each unitholder receives a total of $0.4025 &#32;per unit for that quarter; 

&#8226; 

second, 13% &#32;to the general partner, plus the general partner&#8217;s pro rata interest, and the remainder to all unitholders pro rata until each unitholder receives a total of $0.4375 &#32;per unit for that quarter; 

&#8226;

14. Equity-Based Compensation 

On November 28, 2005, the board of directors of our General Partner adopted a Long-Term Incentive Plan, or the 2005 LTIP, for employees, consultants and directors of our General Partner and its affiliates who perform services for us. The 2005 LTIP provides for the grant of limited partner units, or LPUs, phantom units, unit options and substitute awards, and, with respect to unit options and phantom units, the grant of dividend equivalent rights, or DERs. The 2005 LTIP phantom units consist of a notional unit based on the value of the Partnership's common units. Subject to adjustment for certain events, an 

DCP MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 - (Continued) 

aggregate of 850,000 &#32;LPUs may be issued and delivered pursuant to awards under the 2005 LTIP. Awards that are canceled or forfeited, or are withheld to satisfy the General Partner&#8217;s tax withholding obligations, are available for delivery pursuant to other awards. On February 15, 2012, the board of directors of our General Partner adopted a 2012 LTIP for employees, consultants and directors of our General Partner and its affiliates who perform services for us. The 2012 LTIP provides for the grant of phantom units and DERs. The 2012 LTIP phantom units consist of a notional unit based on the value of common units or shares of Phillips 66 and Spectra Energy. The LTIPs were administered by the compensation committee of the General Partner&#8217;s board of directors through 2012, and by the General Partner&#8217;s board of directors beginning in 2013. Awards are issued under both LTIPs and all awards are subject to cliff vesting. 

Since we have the intent and ability to settle certain awards within our control in units, we classify them as equity awards based on their fair value. The fair value of our equity awards is determined based on the closing price of our common units at the grant date. Compensation expense on equity awards is recognized ratably over each vesting period. We account for other awards which are subject to settlement in cash, including DERs, as liability awards. Compensation expense on these awards is recognized ratably over each vesting period, and will be re-measured each reporting period for all awards outstanding until the units are vested. The fair value of all liability awards is determined based on the closing price of our common units at each measurement date. 

We recognized less than $1 million , $1 million &#32;and $2 million &#32;in compensation expense related to our LTIP awards for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. As of December 31, 2015 , we have less than $1 million &#32;of unrecognized compensation expense related to LTIP awards. 

15. Net Income or Loss per Limited Partner Unit 

Our net income or loss is allocated to the general partner and the limited partners in accordance with their respective ownership percentages, after allocating Available Cash generated during the period in accordance with our partnership agreement. 

Securities that meet the definition of a participating security are required to be considered for inclusion in the computation of basic earnings per unit using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, earnings per unit is calculated as if all of the earnings for the period were distributed under the terms of the partnership agreement, regardless of whether the general partner has discretion over the amount of distributions to be made in any particular period, whether those earnings would actually be distributed during a particular period from an economic or practical perspective, or whether the general partner has other legal or contractual limitations on its ability to pay distributions that would prevent it from distributing all of the earnings for a particular period. 

These required disclosures do not impact our overall net income or loss or other financial results; however, in periods in which aggregate net income exceeds our Available Cash it will have the impact of reducing net income per LPU. 

Basic and diluted net income or loss per limited partner unit, or LPU, is calculated by dividing net income or loss allocable to limited partners, by the weighted-average number of outstanding LPUs during the period. Diluted net income or loss per LPU is computed based on the weighted average number of units plus the effect of dilutive potential units outstanding during the period using the two-class method. Dilutive potential units include outstanding awards under our Long-Term Incentive Plan. The dilutive effect of unit-based awards was 7,038 , 10,574 &#32;and 19,179 &#32;equivalent units during the years ended &#32; December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;respectively. 

16. Income Taxes 

We are structured as a master limited partnership with sufficient qualifying income, which is a pass-through entity for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we had no federal income tax expense for the years ended &#32; December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

The State of Texas imposes a margin tax that is assessed at 0.75% , 0.95% , and 0.975% , of taxable margin apportioned to Texas for the years ended &#32; December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 .

We had net long-term deferred tax liabilities of $8 million &#32;and $13 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. These state deferred tax liabilities relate to our Texas operations and are primarily associated with depreciation related to property, plant and equipment. 

Our effective tax rate differs from statutory rates, primarily due to being structured as a master limited partnership, which is a pass-through entity for federal income tax purposes, while being treated as a taxable entity in certain states. 

17 . Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 

Litigation &#32;&#8212; We are not a party to any significant legal proceedings, but are a party to various administrative and regulatory proceedings and commercial disputes that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business. Management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of the foregoing matters, taken as a whole, and after consideration of amounts accrued, insurance coverage or other indemnification arrangements, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flow. 

Insurance &#8212; We have renewed our insurance policies for the 2015-2016 insurance year. We contract with third party insurers for: (1) automobile liability insurance for all owned, non-owned and hired vehicles; (2) general liability insurance; (3) excess liability insurance above the established primary limits for general liability and automobile liability insurance; and (4) property insurance, which covers replacement value of real and personal property and includes business interruption/extra expense. These renewals have not resulted in any material change to the premiums we are contracted to pay. We are jointly insured with DCP Midstream, LLC for a portion of the insurance covering our directors and officers for acts related to our business activities. All coverage is subject to certain limits and deductibles, the terms and conditions of which management believes are common for companies that are of similar size to us and with similar types of operations. 

The insurance on Discovery, as placed by Williams Field Service Group LLC, for the 2015-2016 insurance year includes general and excess liability, onshore property damage, including named windstorm and business interruption, and offshore non-wind property and business interruption insurance. We believe offshore named windstorm property and business interruption insurance that is available comes at uneconomic premium levels, high deductibles and low coverage limits. As such, Discovery continues to elect not to purchase offshore named windstorm property and business interruption insurance coverage for the 2015-2016 insurance year. 

Environmental &#32;&#8212; The operation of pipelines, plants and other facilities for gathering, transporting, processing, treating, or storing natural gas, NGLs and other products is subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment. As an owner or operator of these facilities, we must comply with laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels that relate to air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste management and disposal, and other environmental matters. The cost of planning, designing, constructing and operating pipelines, plants, and other facilities incorporates compliance with environmental laws and regulations and safety standards. In addition, there is increasing focus, from city, state and federal regulatory officials and through litigation, on hydraulic fracturing and the real or perceived environmental impacts of this technique, which indirectly presents some risk to our available supply of natural gas. Failure to comply with these various health, safety and environmental laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and potentially criminal enforcement measures, including citizen suits, which can include the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, and the issuance of injunctions or restrictions on operation. Management believes that, based on currently known information, compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. &#32; 

Indemnification &#32;&#8212; DCP Midstream, LLC has indemnified us for certain potential environmental claims, losses and expenses associated with the operation of the assets of certain of our predecessors.

18 . Business Segments 

Our operations are located in the United States and are organized into three &#32;reporting segments: Natural Gas Services; NGL Logistics; and Wholesale Propane Logistics. Our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews financial information about our operating segments, which are aggregated into the reporting units presented, in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. 

Natural Gas Services &#32;&#8212; Our Natural Gas Services segment provides services that include gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting and storing natural gas, and fractionating NGLs. The segment consists of our Eagle Ford system, East Texas system, Southeast Texas system, Michigan system, Northern Louisiana system, Southern Oklahoma system, Wyoming system, DJ Basin system, 75% &#32;interest in the Piceance system and 40% &#32;interest in Discovery. 

NGL Logistics &#32;&#8212; Our NGL Logistics segment provides services that include transportation, storage and fractionation of NGLs. The segment consists of our storage facility in Michigan, the DJ Basin fractionators, 12.5% &#32;interest in the Mont Belvieu Enterprise fractionator, 20% &#32;interest in the Mont Belvieu 1 fractionator, 10% &#32;interest in the Texas Express intrastate pipeline, 15% &#32;interest in the Panola intrastate pipeline, 33.33% &#32;interests in the Southern Hills, Sand Hills and Front Range pipelines, the Black Lake and Wattenberg interstate pipelines and the Seabreeze and Wilbreeze intrastate pipelines. 

Wholesale Propane Logistics &#32;&#8212; Our Wholesale Propane Logistics segment provides services that include the receipt of propane and other liquefied petroleum gases by pipeline, rail or ship to our terminals that store and deliver the product to distributors. The segment consists of 6 rail terminals, one marine terminal, one pipeline terminal and access to several open-access pipeline terminals. 

These segments are monitored separately by management for performance against our internal forecast and are consistent with internal financial reporting. These segments have been identified based on the differing products and services, regulatory environment and the expertise required for these operations. Gross margin is a performance measure utilized by management to monitor the operations of each segment. 

The following tables set forth our segment information: &#160;

(a) 

Gross margin consists of total operating revenues, including commodity derivative activity, less purchases of natural gas, propane and NGLs. Gross margin is viewed as a non-GAAP measure under the rules of the SEC, but is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary performance measure used by management as it represents the results of product sales versus product purchases. As an indicator of our operating performance, gross margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or cash flow as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our gross margin may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because other entities may not calculate gross margin in the same manner. 

(b) 

Non-cash commodity derivative mark-to-market is included in gross margin, along with cash settlements for our commodity derivative contracts. 

(c) 

The segment information for the years ended &#32; December 31, 2014 &#32;includes the results of our Lucerne 1 plant. This transfer of net assets between entities under common control was accounted for as if the transfer occurred at the beginning of the period to furnish comparative information, similar to the pooling method. 

(d) 

Other long-term assets not allocable to segments consist of unrealized gains on derivative instruments, corporate leasehold improvements and other long-term assets.
