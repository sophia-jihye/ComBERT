BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES 

General 

&#160; 

Cheniere, a Delaware corporation, was organized in 1983 and is a Houston-based energy company primarily engaged in LNG-related businesses. We own and operate the Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Louisiana through our ownership interest in and management agreements with Cheniere Partners, which is a publicly traded limited partnership that we created in 2007. We own 100% of the general partner interest in Cheniere Partners and 80.1% of Cheniere Holdings, which is a publicly traded limited liability company formed in 2013 that owns a 55.9% limited partner interest in Cheniere Partners. We are currently developing and constructing two natural gas liquefaction and export facilities. 

&#160; 

The Sabine Pass LNG terminal is located on the Sabine-Neches Waterway less than four miles from the Gulf Coast. The Sabine Pass LNG terminal has operational regasification facilities owned by Cheniere Partners&#8217; wholly owned subsidiary, SPLNG, that include existing infrastructure of five LNG storage tanks with capacity of approximately 16.9 Bcfe, two docks that can accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters and vaporizers with regasification capacity of approximately 4.0 Bcf/d. Cheniere Partners is developing and constructing natural gas liquefaction facilities (the &#8220;SPL Project&#8221;) &#32;at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal adjacent to the existing regasification facilities through a wholly owned subsidiary, SPL. Cheniere Partners is constructing five Trains and developing a sixth Train, each of which is expected to have a nominal production capacity of approximately 4.5 mtpa of LNG. Cheniere Partners also owns a 94-mile pipeline that interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG terminal with a number of large interstate pipelines (the &#8220;Creole Trail Pipeline&#8221;) &#32;through a wholly owned subsidiary, CTPL. 

We are developing and constructing a second natural gas liquefaction and export facility at the Corpus Christi LNG terminal, which is on nearly 2,000 &#32;acres of land that we own or control near Corpus Christi, Texas, and a pipeline facility (the &#8220;CCL Project&#8221;) &#32;through wholly owned subsidiaries CCL and CCP, respectively. The CCL Project &#32;is being developed for up to three Trains, with expected aggregate nominal production capacity of approximately 13.5 mtpa &#32;of LNG, three LNG storage tanks with capacity of approximately 10.1 Bcfe &#32;and two docks that can accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters. The CCL Project &#32;is being developed in stages. The first stage (&#8220;Stage 1&#8221;) &#32;includes Trains 1 and 2, two LNG storage tanks, one complete marine berth and a second partial berth and all of the CCL Project &#8217;s necessary infrastructure facilities. The second stage (&#8220;Stage 2&#8221;) &#32;includes Train 3, one LNG storage tank and the completion of the second partial berth. The CCL Project &#32;also includes a 23-mile, 48-inch natural gas supply pipeline that will interconnect the Corpus Christi LNG terminal with several interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines (the &#8220;Corpus Christi Pipeline&#8221;) . 

The CCL Stage III entities, wholly owned subsidiaries of Cheniere separate from the CCH Group, are also developing two additional Trains and one LNG storage tank at the Corpus Christi LNG terminal adjacent to the CCL Project , along with a second natural gas pipeline. 

Cheniere Marketing is engaged in the LNG and natural gas marketing business and is developing a portfolio of long-term, short-term and spot SPAs. Cheniere Marketing has entered into SPAs with SPL and CCL to purchase LNG produced by the SPL Project &#32;and the CCL Project . 

We are also in various stages of developing other projects which, among other things, will require acceptable commercial and financing arrangements before we make a final investment decision (&#8220;FID&#8221;) . 

LNG is natural gas that, through a refrigeration process, has been cooled to a liquid state, which occupies a volume that is approximately 1/600th of its gaseous state. The liquefaction of natural gas into LNG allows it to be shipped economically from areas of the world where natural gas is abundant and inexpensive to produce to other areas where natural gas demand and infrastructure exist to justify economically the use of LNG. LNG is transported using large oceangoing LNG tankers specifically constructed for this purpose. LNG regasification facilities offload LNG from LNG tankers, store the LNG prior to processing, heat the LNG to return it to a gaseous state and deliver the resulting natural gas into pipelines for transportation to market. 

Although results are consolidated for financial reporting, Cheniere, Cheniere Holdings, Cheniere Partners, SPL, SPLNG, CTPL and the CCH Group operate with independent capital structures. The following diagram depicts our abbreviated capital structure as of December 31, 2015 : 

&#32; 

Our Business Strategy

LNG Terminal Business 

&#160; 

We began developing our LNG terminal business in 1999 and were among the first companies to secure sites and commence development of new LNG terminals in North America. We are currently focusing our development efforts on two LNG terminal projects currently under construction: the Sabine Pass LNG terminal in western Cameron Parish, Louisiana, less than four miles from the Gulf Coast on the Sabine-Neches Waterway; and the Corpus Christi LNG terminal near Corpus Christi, Texas. Through Cheniere Partners, we have constructed and are operating regasification facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and are developing and constructing the SPL Project . We own 100% of the general partner interest in Cheniere Partners and 80.1% of Cheniere Holdings, which owns a 55.9% limited partner interest in Cheniere Partners. We currently own a 100% interest in the CCL Project . 

&#160; 

Sabine Pass LNG Terminal 

Regasification Facilities 

&#160; 

The Sabine Pass LNG terminal has operational regasification capacity of approximately 4.0 Bcf/d &#32;and aggregate LNG storage capacity of approximately 16.9 Bcfe . Approximately 2.0 Bcf/d &#32;of the regasification capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal has been reserved under two long-term third-party TUA s, under which SPLNG&#8217;s customers are required to pay fixed monthly fees, whether or not they use the LNG terminal. Each of Total Gas &#38; Power North America, Inc. (&#8220;Total&#8221;) &#32;and Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (&#8220;Chevron&#8221;) &#32;has reserved approximately 1.0 Bcf/d &#32;of regasification capacity and is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to SPLNG aggregating approximately $125 million annually for 20 years that commenced in 2009. Total S.A. has guaranteed Total &#8217;s obligations under its TUA &#32;up to $2.5 billion, subject to certain exceptions, and Chevron Corporation has guaranteed Chevron &#8217;s obligations under its TUA &#32;up to 80% of the fees payable by Chevron . 

The remaining approximately 2.0 Bcf/d of capacity has been reserved under a TUA by SPL. SPL is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to SPLNG aggregating approximately $250 million annually, continuing until at least 20 years after SPL delivers its first commercial cargo at the SPL Project . SPL entered into a partial TUA assignment agreement with Total , whereby SPL will progressively gain access to Total &#8217;s capacity and other services provided under Total &#8217;s TUA with SPLNG. This agreement will provide SPL with additional berthing and storage capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal that may be used to accommodate the development of Trains 5 and 6, provide increased flexibility in managing LNG cargo loading and unloading activity starting with the commencement of commercial operations of Train 3 and permit SPL to more flexibly manage its LNG storage capacity with the commencement of Train 1. Notwithstanding any arrangements between Total &#32;and SPL, payments required to be made by Total &#32;to SPLNG will continue to be made by Total &#32;to SPLNG in accordance with its TUA. 

Under each of these TUAs, SPLNG is entitled to retain 2% of the LNG delivered to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal. 

Liquefaction Facilities 

The SPL Project &#32;is being developed and constructed at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal adjacent to the existing regasification facilities. We have received authorization from the FERC to site, construct and operate Trains 1 through 6. We commenced construction of Trains 1 and 2 and the related new facilities needed to treat, liquefy, store and export natural gas in August 2012. Construction of Trains 3 and 4 and the related facilities commenced in May 2013. In June 2015, we commenced construction of Train 5 and the related facilities. 

The DOE &#32;has authorized the export of up to a combined total of the equivalent of 16 mtpa &#32;(approximately 803 Bcf/yr ) of domestically produced LNG by vessel from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to FTA countries &#32;for a 30-year term and to non-FTA countries &#32;for a 20-year term. The DOE &#32;further issued an order authorizing SPL to export up to the equivalent of approximately 203 Bcf/yr &#32;of domestically produced LNG from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to FTA countries &#32;for a 25-year period. SPL&#8217;s application for authorization to export that same 203 Bcf/yr &#32;of domestically produced LNG from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to non-FTA countries &#32;is currently pending at the DOE . Additionally, the DOE &#32;issued orders authorizing SPL to export up to a combined total of 503.3 Bcf/yr &#32;of domestically produced LNG from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to FTA countries &#32;and non-FTA countries &#32;for a 20-year term. A party to the proceeding requested a rehearing of the non-FTA order pertaining to the 503.3 Bcf/yr , and the DOE &#32;has not yet issued a final ruling on the rehearing request. In each case, the terms of these authorizations begin on the earlier of the date of first export thereunder or the date specified in the particular order, which ranges from 5 to 10 years from the date the order was issued. Furthermore, the DOE issued an order authorizing SPL to export up to 600 Bcf in total of domestically produced LNG by vessel from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to FTA countries and non-FTA countries over a two-year period commencing on January 15, 2016. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the overall project completion percentages for Trains 1 and 2 and Trains 3 and 4 of the SPL Project &#32;were approximately 97.4% &#32;and 79.5% , respectively.

Competition 

SPLNG currently does not experience competition for its terminal capacity because the entire approximately 4.0 Bcf/d of regasification capacity that is available at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal has been fully contracted. If and when SPLNG has to replace any TUAs, it will compete with other then-existing LNG terminals for customers. 

The SPL Project &#32;currently does not experience competition with respect to Trains 1 through 5. SPL has entered into six fixed price, 20-year SPAs with third parties that will utilize substantially all of the liquefaction capacity available from these Trains. The CCL Project &#32;currently does not experience competition with respect to Trains 1 and 2. CCL has entered into seven fixed price, 20-year SPAs with six third parties that will utilize a substantial majority of the liquefaction capacity available from these Trains. 

Each customer will be required to pay an escalating fixed fee for its annual contract quantity even if it elects not to purchase any LNG from us. 

If and when SPL or CCL need to replace any existing SPA or enter into new SPAs, they will compete on the basis of price per contracted volume of LNG with each other and other natural gas liquefaction projects throughout the world. Revenues associated with any incremental volumes, including those under the SPAs with Cheniere Marketing discussed above, will also be subject to market-based price competition. Many of the companies with which we compete are major energy corporations with longer operating histories, more development experience, greater name recognition, greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater access to markets than us. 

Governmental Regulation 

&#160; 

Our LNG terminals are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state and local statutes, rules, regulations and laws. These laws require that we engage in consultations with appropriate federal and state agencies and that we obtain and maintain applicable permits and other authorizations. This regulatory requirement increases our cost of operations and construction, and failure to comply with such laws could result in substantial penalties. 

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 

T he design, construction and operation of our liquefaction facilities and the export of LNG and the transportation of natural gas through the Creole Trail Pipeline &#32;and the Corpus Christi Pipeline &#32;are highly regulated activities. In order to site and construct our LNG terminals, we received and are required to maintain authorizations from the FERC under Section 3 of the NGA. The FERC&#8217;s approval under Section 3 of the NGA, as well as several other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits, are required in order to site, construct and operate our liquefaction facilities. 

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the &#8220;EPAct&#8221;) &#32;amended Section 3 of the NGA to establish or clarify the FERC &#8217;s exclusive authority to approve or deny an application for the siting, construction, expansion or operation of LNG terminals, although except as specifically provided in the EPAct , nothing in the EPAct &#32;is intended to affect otherwise applicable law related to any other federal agency&#8217;s authorities or responsibilities related to LNG terminals. The FERC &#32;issued final orders in April and July 2012 approving our application for an order under Section 3 of the NGA authorizing the siting, construction and operation of Trains 1 through 4 of the SPL Project . Subsequently, the FERC &#32;issued written approval to commence site preparation work for Trains 1 through 4. In October 2012, we applied to amend the FERC &#32;approval to reflect certain modifications to the SPL Project , and in August 2013, the FERC &#32;issued an order approving the modifications. In October 2013, we applied to further amend the FERC &#32;approval, requesting authorization to increase the total LNG production capacity of Trains 1 through 4 from the currently authorized 803 Bcf/yr to 1,006 Bcf/yr so as to more accurately reflect the estimated maximum LNG production capacity. In February 2014, the FERC &#32;issued an order approving the October 2013 application (the &#8220;February 2014 Order&#8221;) . A party to the proceeding requested a rehearing of the February 2014 Order, and in September 2014, the FERC denied rehearing. The party petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the February 2014 Order &#32;and the FERC Order Denying Rehearing, and that appeal is still pending. In September 2013, we filed an application with the FERC for authorization to add Trains 5 and 6 to the SPL Project , which was granted by the FERC in April 2015. 

In order to construct, own, operate and maintain the Creole Trail Pipeline , CTPL received a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the FERC under Section 7 of the NGA. The FERC&#8217;s approval under Section 7 of the NGA, as well as several other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits, may be required prior to making any modifications to the Creole Trail Pipeline &#32;as it is a regulated, interstate natural gas pipeline. The FERC also approved CTPL&#8217;s application for authorization to construct, own, operate and maintain certain new facilities in order to enable bi-directional natural gas flow on the Creole Trail Pipeline &#32;system to allow for the delivery of up to 1,530,000 Dthd of feed gas to the SPL Project . In November 2013, CTPL received approval from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (&#8220;LDEQ&#8221;) &#32;for the proposed modifications and, with subsequent final FERC clearance, construction was completed in 2015. 

In December 2014, the FERC issued an order granting CCL authorization under Section 3 of the NGA to site, construct and operate Stages 1 and 2 of the CCL Project &#32;and granting CCP a certificate of public convenience and necessity under Section 7(c) of the NGA to construct and operate the Corpus Christi Pipeline &#32; (the &#8220;December 2014 Order&#8221;) . A party to the proceeding requested a rehearing of the December 2014 Order , and in May 2015, the FERC denied rehearing. The party petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the December 2014 Order &#32;and the FERC Order Denying Rehearing, and that appeal is still pending. 

Several other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits will be required prior to construction and operation of our liquefaction projects. In addition, the FERC authorization requires us to obtain certain additional FERC approvals as construction progresses. To date, we have been able to obtain these approvals as needed and the need for these approvals has not materially affected our construction progress. Throughout the life of our LNG terminals, we will be subject to regular reporting requirements to the FERC, the U.S. Department of Transportation and applicable state regulatory agencies regarding the operation and maintenance of our facilities. 

In addition to the siting and construction authority with respect to the LNG terminals under the NGA, the FERC has authority to approve, and if necessary, set &#8220;just and reasonable rates&#8221; for the transportation or sale of natural gas in interstate commerce. In addition, under the NGA, our pipelines are not permitted to unduly discriminate or grant undue preference as to rates or the terms and conditions of service. The FERC has the authority to grant certificates allowing construction and operation of facilities used in interstate gas transportation and authorizing the provision of services. Under the NGA, the FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction generally extends to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, to the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale for ultimate consumption for domestic, commercial, industrial or any other use and to natural gas companies engaged in such transportation or sale. However, the FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction does not extend to the production, gathering or local distribution of natural gas. 

In general, the FERC&#8217;s authority to regulate interstate natural gas pipelines and the services that they provide includes: 

&#8226; 

rates and charges for natural gas transportation and related services; 

&#8226; 

the certification and construction of new facilities; 

&#8226; 

the extension and abandonment of services and facilities; 

&#8226; 

the maintenance of accounts and records; 

&#8226; 

the acquisition and disposition of facilities; 

&#8226; 

the initiation and discontinuation of services; and 

&#8226; 

various other matters. 

The FERC&#8217;s Standards of Conduct apply to interstate pipelines that conduct transmission transactions with an affiliate that engages in marketing functions. Interstate pipelines must treat all transmission customers on a not unduly discriminatory basis. The general principles of the Standards of Conduct are: (1) independent functioning, which requires transmission function employees to function independently of marketing function employees; (2) no-conduit rule, which prohibits passing transmission function information to marketing function employees; and (3) transparency, which imposes posting requirements to detect undue preference. CTPL has established the required policies and procedures to comply with the FERC&#8217;s Standards of Conduct and is subject to audit by the FERC to review compliance, policies and its training programs. 

In 2002, the FERC concluded that it would apply light-handed regulation over the rates, terms and conditions agreed to by parties for LNG terminalling services, such that LNG terminal owners would not be required to provide open-access service at non-discriminatory rates or maintain a tariff or rate schedule on file with the FERC, as distinguished from the requirements applied to our FERC-regulated natural gas pipelines. The EPAct &#32;codified the FERC&#8217;s policy, but those provisions expired on January 1, 2015. Nonetheless, we see no indication that the FERC intends to modify its longstanding policy of light-handed regulation of LNG terminals. 

DOE Export License 

The DOE has authorized the export of up to a combined total of the equivalent of 16 mtpa (approximately 803 Bcf/yr) of domestically produced LNG by vessel from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to FTA countries for a 30-year term and to non-FTA countries for a 20-year term. The DOE further issued an order authorizing SPL to export up to the equivalent of approximately 203 Bcf/yr of domestically produced LNG from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to FTA countries for a 25-year period. SPL&#8217;s application for authorization to export that same 203 Bcf/yr of domestically produced LNG from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to non-FTA countries is currently pending at the DOE. Additionally, the DOE issued orders authorizing SPL to export up to a combined total of 503.3 Bcf/yr of domestically produced LNG from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to FTA countries and non-FTA countries for a 20-year term. A party to the proceeding requested a rehearing of the non-FTA order pertaining to the 503.3 Bcf/yr, and the DOE has not yet issued a final ruling on the rehearing request. Furthermore, the DOE issued an order authorizing SPL 

to export up to 600 Bcf in total of domestically produced LNG by vessel from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to FTA countries and non-FTA countries over a two-year period commencing on January 15, 2016. 

&#160; 

The DOE has authorized the export of up to a combined total of the equivalent of 15 mtpa (approximately 767 Bcf/yr) of domestically produced LNG by vessel from the CCL Project to FTA countries for a 25-year term and to non-FTA countries for a 20-year term. A party to the proceeding requested a rehearing of the non-FTA order, and the DOE has not yet issued a final ruling on the rehearing request. Additionally, the DOE has authorized the export of up to a combined total of the equivalent of 514 Bcf/yr of domestically produced LNG by vessel from the two additional Trains being developed adjacent to the CCL Project to FTA countries for a 20-year term. The application for authorization to export that same 514 Bcf/yr of domestically produced LNG by vessel to non-FTA countries is currently pending at the DOE. 

In each case, other than as otherwise specified, the terms of these authorizations begin on the earlier of the date of first export thereunder or the date specified in the particular order, which ranges from 5 to 10 years from the date the order was issued. 

Exports of natural gas to FTA countries are &#8220;deemed to be consistent with the public interest&#8221; and authorization to export LNG to FTA countries shall be granted by the DOE without &#8220;modification or delay.&#8221; FTA countries which import LNG now or will do so by 2016 include Chile, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea and the Dominican Republic. Exports of natural gas to non-FTA countries are considered by the DOE in the context of a comment period whereby interveners are provided the opportunity to assert that such authorization would not be consistent with the public interest. 

Pipelines 

The Creole Trail Pipeline &#32;and the Corpus Christi Pipeline &#32;are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;), under the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration (&#8220;PHMSA&#8221;), pursuant to which the PHMSA has established requirements relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of pipeline facilities. 

The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, as amended (&#8220;PSIA&#8221;), which is administered by the PHMSA Office of Pipeline Safety, governs the areas of testing, education, training and communication. The PSIA requires pipeline companies to perform extensive integrity tests on natural gas transportation pipelines that exist in high population density areas designated as &#8220;high consequence areas.&#8221; Pipeline companies are required to perform the integrity tests on a seven-year cycle. The risk ratings are based on numerous factors, including the population density in the geographic regions served by a particular pipeline, as well as the age and condition of the pipeline and its protective coating. Testing consists of hydrostatic testing, internal electronic testing, or direct assessment of the piping. In addition to the pipeline integrity tests, pipeline companies must implement a qualification program to make certain that employees are properly trained. Pipeline operators also must develop integrity management programs for gas transportation pipelines, which requires pipeline operators to perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity; identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area; improve data collection, integration and analysis; repair and remediate the pipeline, as necessary; and implement preventive and mitigation actions. 

In 2010, the PHMSA issued a final rule (known as &#8220;Control Room Management/Human Factors Rule&#8221;) requiring pipeline operators to write and institute certain control room procedures that address human factors and fatigue management. In August 2011, the PHMSA issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking addressing whether changes are needed to the regulations governing the safety of gas transmission pipelines. Specifically, PHMSA is considering whether integrity management requirements should be changed, including whether the definition of &#8220;high consequence area&#8221; should be revised and whether additional restrictions should be placed on the use of specific pipeline assessment methods. The PHMSA is also considering whether to revise requirements for non-integrity management issues, such as mainline valves, corrosion control issues and the safety of gathering lines. This advanced notice of proposed rulemaking is still pending at the PHMSA. 

In March 2015, the PHMSA issued a final rule amending the pipeline safety regulations to update and clarify certain regulatory requirements, including who can perform post-construction inspections on transmission pipelines. In May 2015, the PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to amend gas pipeline safety regulations regarding plastic piping systems used in gas services, including the installation of plastic pipe used for gas transmission lines. In July 2015, the PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to add a specific timeframe for operators&#8217; notification of accidents or incidents, as well as amending the safety regulations regarding operator qualification requirements by expanding the requirements to include new construction and certain previously excluded operation and maintenance tasks, requiring a program effectiveness review and adding new recordkeeping requirements. These notices of proposed rulemaking are still pending at the PHMSA. 

Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (&#8220;NGPSA&#8221;) 

Louisiana and Texas administer federal pipeline safety standards under the NGPSA, which requires certain pipelines to comply with safety standards in constructing and operating the pipelines and subjects the pipelines to regular inspections. Failure to comply with the NGPSA may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies. 

Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Jobs Creation Act of 2011 

The Creole Trail Pipeline &#32;and Corpus Christi Pipeline &#32;are also subject to the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Jobs Creation Act of 2011, which regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas transmission facilities. Under the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, PHMSA has civil penalty authority up to $200,000 per day (increased from the prior $100,000), with a maximum of $2 million for any related series of violations (increased from the prior $1 million). 

Other Governmental Permits, Approvals and Authorizations 

The construction and operation of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and the CCL Project are subject to additional federal permits, orders, approvals and consultations required by other federal agencies, including the DOE, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (&#8220;USACE&#8221;), U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Services, U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Environmental Protection Agency (the &#8220;EPA&#8221;) and U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 

Three significant permits are the USACE Section 404 of the Clean Water Act/Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act Permit (the &#8220;Section 10/404 Permit&#8221;), the Clean Air Act Title V (&#8220;Title V&#8221;) Operating Permit and the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (&#8220;PSD&#8221;) Permit, the latter two permits being issued by the LDEQ &#32;for the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (&#8220;TCEQ&#8221;) for the CCL Project. 

The application for revision of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal&#8217;s Section 10/404 Permit to authorize construction of Train 1 through Train 4 was submitted in January 2011. The process included a public comment period which commenced in March 2011 and closed in April 2011. The revised Section 10/404 Permit was received from the USACE in March 2012. An application for a further revision to the Section 10/404 Permit, to address wetlands impacted by the construction of Trains 5 and 6, was received from the USACE in June 2015. The USACE acted in the capacity as a cooperating agency in the FERC&#8217;s NEPA review process. In addition, a Section 10/404 permit application is pending with respect to the expansion of the Creole Trail Pipeline . These permits will require us to provide mitigation to compensate for the wetlands impacted by the respective projects. The application to amend the Sabine Pass LNG terminal&#8217;s existing Title V and PSD permits to authorize construction of Train 1 through Train 4 was initially submitted in December 2010 and revised in March 2011. The process included a public comment period from June 2011 to August 2011 and a public hearing in August 2011. The final revised Title V and PSD permits were issued by the LDEQ &#32;in December 2011. Although these permits are final, a petition with the EPA has been filed pursuant to the Clean Air Act requesting that the EPA object to the Title V permit. The EPA has not ruled on this petition. In June 2012, Cheniere Partners applied to the LDEQ &#32;for a further amendment to the Title V and PSD permits to reflect proposed modifications to the SPL Project &#32;that were filed with the FERC in October 2012. The LDEQ &#32;issued the amended PSD and Title V permits in March 2013. These permits are final. In September 2013, Cheniere Partners applied to the LDEQ &#32;for another amendment to its PSD and Title V permits seeking approval to, among other things, construct and operate Trains 5 and 6. The LDEQ issued the amended PSD and Title V permits in June 2015. These permits are final. 

An application for an amendment to CCL&#8217;s Section 10/404 Permit to authorize construction of the CCL Project was submitted in August 2012. The process included a public comment period which commenced in May 2013 and closed in June 2013. The permit was issued by the USACE in July 2014 and subsequently modified in October 2014. CCL applied for new PSD and Title V permits with the TCEQ in August 2012. The TCEQ issued the PSD permit for criteria pollutants in September 2014, the PSD permit for greenhouse gases (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) in February 2015, and the Title V permit in July 2015. 

CTPL was issued new Title V and PSD permits for the proposed modifications to the Creole Trail Pipeline &#32;system by the LDEQ &#32;in November 2013. 

In August 2012, Cheniere Corpus Christi Pipeline applied to the TCEQ for new PSD and Title V permits for the proposed compressor station at Sinton, Texas (the &#8220;Sinton Compressor Station&#8221;). The PSD permit for criteria pollutants at the Sinton Compressor Station was issued by the TCEQ in December 2013; and in November 2014, the TCEQ approved an alteration to the permit to reflect that the Sinton Compressor Station is now considered a minor source, and voided the PSD permit number. The Title V permit was received in May 2015. 

In August 2014, the Sabine Pass LNG terminal&#8217;s existing wastewater discharge permit was modified by LDEQ &#32;to authorize the discharge of wastewaters from the liquefaction facilities, including wastewaters generated with respect to the anticipated operations of Trains 5 and 6. CCL was issued a waste water discharge permit in January 2014 authorizing discharges from the liquefaction facilities. The permit was issued in January 2014. 

The Sabine Pass LNG terminal and the Corpus Christi LNG terminal are subject to DOT safety regulations and standards for the transportation and storage of LNG and regulations of the U.S. Coast Guard relating to maritime safety and facility security. 

Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

Our LNG terminals are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources. These environmental laws and regulations may impose substantial penalties for noncompliance and substantial liabilities for pollution. Many of these laws and regulations restrict or prohibit the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment and can lead to substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties for non-compliance. 

&#160; 

Clean Air Act (&#8220;CAA&#8221;) 

&#160; 

Our LNG terminals are subject to the federal CAA and comparable state and local laws. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures over the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining permits and approvals addressing air emission-related issues. We do not believe, however, that our operations, or the construction and operations of our liquefaction facilities, will be materially and adversely affected by any such requirements. 

&#160; 

In &#32;2009, the EPA promulgated and finalized the Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule for multiple sections of the economy. This rule requires mandatory reporting of GHG emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources as well as all fugitive emissions throughout LNG terminals. From time to time, Congress has considered proposed legislation directed at reducing GHG emissions, and the EPA has defined GHG emissions thresholds for requiring certain permits for new and existing industrial sources. In addition, many states have already taken regulatory action to monitor and/or reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories or regional GHG cap and trade programs. It is not possible at this time to predict how future regulations or legislation may address GHG emissions and impact our business. However, future regulations and laws could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, operating results &#32;and cash flows. 

Coastal Zone Management Act (&#8220;CZMA&#8221;) 

&#160; 

Our LNG terminals are subject to the review and possible requirements of the CZMA throughout the construction of facilities located within the coastal zone. The CZMA is administered by the states (in Louisiana, by the Department of Natural Resources, and in Texas, by the General Land Office). This program is implemented to ensure that impacts to coastal areas are consistent with the intent of the CZMA to manage the coastal areas. 

Clean Water Act (&#8220;CWA&#8221;) 

&#160; 

Our LNG terminals are subject to the federal CWA and analogous state and local laws. The CWA imposes strict controls on the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters of the United States, including discharges of wastewater and storm water runoff and fill/discharges into waters of the United States. Permits must be obtained prior to discharging pollutants into state and federal waters. The CWA is administered by the EPA, the USACE and by the states (in Louisiana, by the LDEQ , and in Texas, by the TCEQ). 

&#160; 

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) 

&#160; 

The federal RCRA and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. In the event such wastes are generated in connection with our facilities, we will be subject to regulatory requirements affecting the handling, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of such wastes 

&#160; 

Endangered Species Act 

Our LNG terminals may be restricted by requirements under the Endangered Species Act, which seeks to protect endangered or threatened animal, fish and plant species and designated habitats. 

LNG and Natural Gas Marketing Business 

&#160; 

Cheniere Marketing is engaged in the LNG and natural gas marketing business and is developing a portfolio of long-term, short-term and spot LNG SPAs. Cheniere Marketing has purchased, transported and unloaded commercial LNG cargoes into the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and other LNG terminals worldwide and has used trading strategies intended to maximize margins on these cargoes. Cheniere Marketing has secured the following rights and obligations to support its business: 

&#8226; 

pursuant to an SPA &#32;with SPL, the right to purchase, at Cheniere Marketing&#8217;s option, any LNG produced by SPL in excess of that required for other customers; 

&#8226; 

pursuant to SPA s with CCL, the right to purchase, at Cheniere Marketing&#8217;s option, any LNG produced by CCL not required for other customers; and 

&#8226; 

a portfolio of LNG vessel time charters. 

In addition, as of December 31, 2015, Cheniere Marketing has sold approximately 560 million MMBtu of LNG to be delivered to multiple investment grade counterparties between 2016 and 2023, with delivery obligations conditioned on the performance of the SPL Project &#32;and the CCL Project. The cargoes have been sold with a portfolio of delivery points, either on a Free on Board basis, delivered to the counterparty at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, or a Delivered at Terminal (&#8220;DAT&#8221;) &#32;basis, delivered to the counterparty&#8217;s LNG receiving terminal. Cheniere Marketing has chartered LNG vessels to be utilized in DAT &#32;transactions. In addition, Cheniere Marketing has entered into a long-term agreement to sell LNG cargoes on a DAT &#32;basis. The agreement is conditioned upon the buyer achieving certain milestones, including reaching an FID &#32;related to certain projects and obtaining related financing. 

LNG and Natural Gas Marketing Competition &#160; 

In purchasing LNG, we compete for supplies of LNG with: 

&#8226; 

large, multinational and national companies with longer operating histories, more development experience, greater name recognition, larger staffs and substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources; 

&#8226; 

oil and gas producers who sell or control LNG derived from their international oil and gas properties; and 

&#8226; 

purchasers located in other countries where prevailing market prices can be substantially different from those in the United States. 

In marketing LNG and natural gas, we compete for sales of LNG and natural gas with a variety of competitors, including: 

&#8226; 

major integrated marketers who have large amounts of capital to support their marketing operations and offer a full-range of services and market numerous products other than natural gas; 

&#8226; 

producer marketers who sell their own natural gas production or the production of their affiliated natural gas production company; 

&#8226; 

small geographically focused marketers who focus on marketing natural gas for the geographic area in which their affiliated distributor operates; and 

&#8226; 

aggregators who gather small volumes of natural gas from various sources, combine them and sell the larger volumes for more favorable prices and terms than would be possible selling the smaller volumes separately. 

LNG and Natural Gas Marketing Governmental Regulation 

In 1992 and 1993, the FERC concluded that sellers of short-term or long-term natural gas supplies would not have market power over the sale for resale of natural gas. The FERC established light-handed regulation over sales for resale of natural gas and adopted regulations granting blanket certificates to allow entities selling natural gas to make interstate sales for resale at negotiated rates. In 2003, the FERC amended the blanket marketing certificates to require that all sellers adhere to a code of conduct with respect to natural gas sales. The code of conduct addresses such matters as natural gas withholding, manipulation of market prices, communication of accurate information and record retention. 

&#160; 

The FERC&#8217;s Standards of Conduct apply to interstate pipelines that conduct transmission transactions with an affiliate that engages in marketing functions. Interstate pipelines must treat all transmission customers on a not unduly discriminatory basis. The general principles of the Standards of Conduct are: (1) independent functioning, which requires transmission function employees to function independently of marketing function employees; (2) no-conduit rule, which prohibits passing transmission function information to marketing function employees; and (3) transparency, which imposes posting requirements to detect undue preference. 

The EPAct &#32;amended the NGA to prohibit market manipulation, and increased civil and criminal penalties for any violations of the NGA and any rules, regulations or orders of the FERC, up to $1.0 million per day per violation. In accordance with the EPAct , the FERC issued a final rule making it unlawful for any entity, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or transportation service subject to the FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction, to defraud, make an untrue statement of a material fact or omit a material fact or engage in any practice, act or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any entity. 

The prices at which we sell natural gas are not regulated, insofar as the interstate market is concerned and, for the most part, are not subject to state regulation. We are permitted to make sales of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce pursuant to a blanket marketing certificate automatically granted by the FERC. Our sales of natural gas will be affected by the availability, terms and cost of pipeline transportation. As noted above, the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. 

Commodity &#32;Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;) 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) provides for federal regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The regulatory regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act is designed primarily to (1) regulate certain participants in the swaps markets, including entities falling within the categories of &#8220;Swap Dealer&#8221; and &#8220;Major Swap Participant,&#8221; (2) require clearing and exchange trading of certain classes of swaps as designated by the CFTC, (3) increase swap market transparency through robust reporting and recordkeeping requirements, (4) reduce financial risks in the derivatives market by imposing margin or collateral requirements on both cleared and, in certain cases, uncleared swaps, (5) establish position limits on certain swaps and futures products, and (6) otherwise enhance the rulemaking and enforcement authority of the CFTC and the SEC regarding the derivatives markets. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC, the SEC and other regulators have been promulgating rules and regulations implementing the regulatory provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, although neither the CFTC nor the SEC has yet adopted or implemented all of the rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the CFTC and its staff regularly issue rule amendments and guidance, policy statements and letters interpreting or taking no-action positions, including time-limited no action positions, regarding the derivatives provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules of the CFTC under these provisions. 

A provision of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC, in order to diminish or prevent excessive speculation in commodity markets, to adopt rules imposing new position limits on futures contracts, options contracts and economically equivalent physical commodity swaps traded on registered swap trading platforms and on over-the-counter swaps that perform a significant price discovery function with respect to certain markets. In that regard, the CFTC has proposed position limits rules that would modify and expand the applicability of position limits on the amounts of certain core futures contracts and economically equivalent futures contracts, options contracts and swaps for or linked to certain physical commodities, including Henry Hub natural gas, that market participants may hold, subject to limited exemptions for certain bona fide hedging and other types of transactions. It is uncertain at this time when and in what form the CFTC&#8217;s proposed new position limits rules may become final and effective. 

Pursuant to rules adopted by the CFTC, six classes of over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) interest rate and credit default swaps must be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization and executed on an exchange or swap execution facility. The CFTC has not yet proposed to designate any other classes of swaps, including swaps relating to physical commodities, for mandatory clearing, 

but could do so in the future. Although we expect to qualify for the &#8220;end-user exception&#8221; from the mandatory clearing and exchange-trading requirements applicable to any swaps that we enter into to hedge our commercial risks, the mandatory clearing and exchange-trading requirements may apply to other market participants, including our counterparties (who may be registered as Swap Dealers), with respect to other swaps, and the application of such rules may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. 

As required by provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC and federal banking regulators have adopted rules to require Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants, including those that are regulated financial institutions, to collect initial and variation margin with respect to uncleared swaps from their counterparties that are financial end users, registered swap dealers or major swap participants. These rules do not require collection of margin from commercial end users who qualify for the end user exception from the mandatory clearing requirement or certain other counterparties. We expect to qualify as such a commercial end user with respect to the swaps that we enter into to hedge our commercial risks. The Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s swaps regulatory provisions and the related rules may also adversely affect our existing derivative contracts and restrict our ability to monetize such contracts, cause us to restructure certain contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks or to optimize assets, adversely affect our ability to execute our hedging strategies and impact the liquidity of certain swaps products, all of which could increase our business costs. 

Under the Commodity Exchange Act as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC is directed generally to prevent manipulation, including by fraudulent or deceptive practices, in two markets: (1) physical commodities traded in interstate commerce, including physical energy and other commodities, as well as (2) financial instruments, such as futures, options and swaps. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has adopted additional anti-manipulation and anti-disruptive trading practices regulations that prohibit, among other things, manipulative or deceptive schemes in the physical commodities, futures, options and swaps markets. Should we violate these laws and regulations, we could be subject to a CFTC enforcement action and material penalties, possibly resulting in changes in the rates we can charge. 

European Market Infrastructure Regulation (&#8220;EMIR&#8221;) 

EMIR is a European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) regulation designed to increase the stability of the OTC derivative markets throughout the EU member states. EMIR regulates OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories and imposes requirements for certain market participants with respect to derivatives reporting, clearing and risk mitigation. In addition, certain market participants are subject to a central counterparty clearing obligation and collateral requirements. All non-cleared derivatives require risk management, including timely confirmations of transactions, portfolio reconciliation, portfolio compression (when there exist 500 or more OTC derivatives outstanding with a counterparty) and dispute resolution. In addition, standards for the imposition of margin requirements under EMIR were proposed in June 2015, under which the exchange of initial and variation margin in respect of certain non-cleared derivatives would be required, including from non-financial counterparties that are above the EMIR clearing threshold for the class of derivatives involved. Further, for non-cleared derivatives, outstanding contracts must be marked to market value daily or marked to model where conditions necessitate. Other EMIR risk management requirements for non-cleared derivatives are being considered, but those requirements have yet to be finalized. 

Under EMIR, covered entities must report all derivatives concluded and any modification or termination of a derivative to a registered or recognized trade repository within one business day of the transaction. Records related to derivatives must be retained for at least five years following termination. 

Our subsidiaries and affiliates operating in the EU are subject to EMIR and its increased regulatory requirements for record keeping, marking to market, timely confirmation, derivative contract reporting, portfolio reconciliation, the posting of margin and dispute resolution. Regulation under EMIR could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivatives contracts and reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks that we encounter. 

Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (&#8220;REMIT&#8221;) 

REMIT is an EU regulation that prohibits market manipulation and insider trading in European wholesale energy markets and imposes various obligations on participants in these markets. REMIT requires persons who enter into transactions, including the placing of orders to trade, in one or more wholesale energy markets in the EU to notify the applicable national regulatory authority (&#8220;NRA&#8221;) of suspected breaches and implement procedures to identify breaches. All market participants, such as us, must disclose inside information and cannot use inside information to buy or sell wholesale energy products for their own account or on behalf of a third party, directly or indirectly, induce others to buy or sell wholesale energy products based on inside information, 

or disclose such inside information to any other person except in the normal course of employment. Market participants must also register with the relevant NRA (the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (&#8220;Ofgem&#8221;) is the NRA in the United Kingdom) and provide a record of wholesale energy market transactions to the European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (&#8220;ACER&#8221;) and information on capacity and utilization for production, storage, consumption or transmission. An affiliate of Cheniere Marketing is registered with Ofgem as a market participant under REMIT. Should we violate these laws and regulations, we could be subject to investigation and penalties. 

Market participants and third parties acting on their behalf are required to report transactions in wholesale energy contracts admitted to trading at organized market places and fundamental data from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO) central information transparency platforms to ACER. Additional records of transactions and fundamental data with respect to the remaining wholesale energy contracts (OTC standard and non-standard supply contracts and transportation contracts) and reportable fundamental data from transmission system operators (TSOs), storage system operators (SSOs) and LNG system operators (LSOs) will have to be provided to ACER beginning April 7, 2016. 

Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation (&#8220;MiFID II&#8221;) 

MiFID II is an EU directive that is due to apply starting January 3, 2017. Under the current regulatory regime, Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (&#8220;MiFID&#8221;), we are exempt from needing to have our trading activities authorized. MiFID II will narrow the scope of exemptions currently available and broadens the directive&#8217;s application to include commodity derivatives that can be physically settled and are traded on an organized trading facility in addition to other regulated markets or multilateral trading facilities. 

We expect to be eligible to trade on our own account in commodity derivatives without requiring authorization from the Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) in the United Kingdom by relying on the &#8220;ancillary activity&#8221; exemption under MiFID II provided that (1) such activity is ancillary to our main business, when considered on a group basis, and that main business is not the provision of investment services or market making in relation to commodity derivatives; (2) we do not apply a high-frequency algorithmic trading technique; and (3) we notify the relevant competent authority on an annual basis that we are relying on this exemption and, upon request, report the basis upon which we fall within the exemption. If we are unable to meet the ancillary activity exemption, and no other exemption is available to us, then we will need to become authorized by the FCA in order to trade on our own account in commodity derivatives. FCA authorization would require additional regulatory obligations such as capital requirements, conduct of business rules, systems and control issues and approval by the FCA of significant controllers, i.e. our shareholders and certain persons involved in our management. A temporary exemption precludes commodity trading firms from the capital requirements of other investment firms until the end of 2017. This exemption is due for review prior to December 31, 2017. 

Further, if we were to become authorized, we will be counted as a financial counterparty (instead of a non-financial counterparty) for the purpose of EMIR. This may require additional reporting obligations and risk mitigation requirements under EMIR, including collateral exchange and marking transactions either to market or to an approved model. 

Market Abuse Regulation (&#8220;MAR&#8221;) 

MAR, which applies beginning on July 3, 2016, is intended to update and strengthen the existing EU market abuse framework by extending its scope to new markets and by introducing new requirements. MAR prohibits market abuse on EU regulated markets, which encompasses trading in financial instruments on the basis of inside information, the improper disclosure of inside information and the manipulation of market prices through practices such as the dissemination of rumors or the conducting of certain trades in financial instruments. This will apply to financial instruments (as defined under MiFID II) which are traded on an EU regulated market, a multilateral trading facility, or an organized trading facility as well as other financial instruments the price or value of which depends on or has an effect on the price or value of financial instruments. 

Market Factors 

Our ability to enter into additional long-term SPAs to underpin the development of additional Trains, sell any quantities of LNG available under the SPAs with Cheniere Marketing, or develop new projects is subject to market factors, including changes in worldwide supply and demand for natural gas, LNG and substitute products, the relative prices for natural gas, crude oil and substitute products in North America and international markets, economic growth in developing countries, investment in energy infrastructure, the rate of fuel switching for power generation from coal, nuclear or oil to natural gas and access to capital markets. 

We expect that global demand for natural gas and LNG will continue to increase as nations seek more abundant, reliable and environmentally cleaner fuel alternatives to oil and coal. Global demand for natural gas is projected by the International Energy Agency to grow by approximately 23 Tcf between 2013 and 2025, with LNG increasing its current share of approximately ten percent of the global market. Wood Mackenzie forecasts that global demand for LNG will increase by 72%, from approximately 245 mtpa, or 11.9 Tcf, in 2015, to 421 mtpa, or 20.5 Tcf, in 2025 and that LNG production from existing facilities and new facilities already under construction will be able to supply the market with 365 mtpa in 2025, resulting in a market need for construction of additional facilities capable of producing an incremental 56 mtpa of LNG. We believe our new projects that do not already have capacity sold under long-term contracts are competitive and well-positioned to capture a portion of this incremental market need. 

We have limited exposure, particularly in the LNG terminal business for our seven Trains under construction, to the decline in oil prices, even if it persists for more than 12 months, as we have contracted a significant portion of our LNG production capacity under long-term sale and purchase agreements. These agreements contain fixed fees that are required to be paid even if the customers elect to cancel or suspend delivery of LNG cargoes. To date, we have contracted approximately 19.75 mtpa of aggregate production capacity for Trains 1 through 5 of the SPL Project &#32;with third-party customers. Train 6 has not been contracted to date. We have contracted approximately 7.7 mtpa for Trains 1 and 2 of the CCL Project, and approximately 0.8 mtpa for Train 3 of the CCL Project, with third-party customers. As of January 31, 2016 , oil and gas futures prices indicate that LNG exported from the U.S. continues to be competitively priced, supporting the opportunity for U.S. LNG to fill uncontracted future demand through the execution of long-term, medium-term and short-term contracting of LNG from our terminals. 

Subsidiaries 

&#160; 

Our assets are generally held by or under our subsidiaries. We conduct most of our business through these subsidiaries, including the development, construction and operation of our LNG terminal business and the development and operation of our LNG and natural gas marketing business. 

Employees
