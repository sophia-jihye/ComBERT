Orion Marine Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation. The common stock of Orion Marine Group, Inc. is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ORN. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to &#8220;Orion&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, the &#8220;Registrant&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Orion Marine Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates. 

History and growth 

Orion Marine Group, Inc. was founded in 1994 as a marine construction project management business. Since then, we have expanded our reach both through organic growth and acquisitions. We have successfully acquired and fully integrated several companies into our operations, most recently with the acquisition of T.A.S. Commercial Concrete Construction, LLC ("TAS") during 2015. This acquisition adds another segment to our business, provides diversification of end market drivers and a diversified customer base. These strategic acquisitions have also enhanced our operational capabilities, provided us with a larger geographic base, and added to our equipment fleet. 

Our Business Strategy 

We employ the following key business strategies: 

&#8226; 

Continue to add construction capabilities - &#32; We seek to add capabilities that augment our core contracting and construction competencies, improve our gross margin opportunities, and compete more effectively for contracts that might not otherwise be available to us. 

&#8226; 

Expand into new markets and complementary service offerings and selectively pursue strategic acquisitions - We seek to identify attractive new markets and strategic opportunities to expand our service offering through selective acquisitions, greenfield expansions or diversification. 

&#8226; 

Continue to capitalize on favorable long-term industry trends - We seek to capitalize on infrastructure capital investments across the markets we serve including port and marine infrastructure, government funded projects, transportation, oil and gas facilities, recreational waterside industry infrastructure expansion and environmental restoration markets. We seek to capitalize on privately funded projects across the commercial concrete markets we serve including industrial, institutional, commercial real estate, and recreational developments. 

&#8226; 

Diversification - To mitigate the risks inherent in the construction business as the result of general economic factors, we pursue projects in both the public and private sectors for a wide range of customers within each sector (from the federal government to small municipalities and from large corporations to small owners and developers and in diverse geographic markets. 

&#8226; 

Continue to reinvest in our core operations - We pursue technically complex projects where our people, specialized services and equipment differentiate us from our competitors. We intend to continue to enhance the types, numbers or capabilities of our equipment, so we can provide turnkey construction services to our customers. This means when we are called on for business, we have the right people, skills, and equipment readily available for multiple projects. 

&#8226; 

Continue to attract, retain and develop our employees - &#32;We believe our employees are integral to the success of our project execution, and we continue to allocate resources to attract and retain talented managers, supervisors and field personnel. 

&#8226; 

Ownership of equipment &#160;- We own a large fleet of well-maintained construction equipment. The ownership of this equipment enables us to compete more effectively by ensuring availability of equipment at a favorable cost. 

Our operating principles and guiding beliefs include: 

&#8226; 

Safety &#160;- We believe accident prevention is a moral obligation as well as a good business practice. By identifying and concentrating resources to address jobsite hazards, we continually strive to reduce our incident rates and the costs associated with accidents. 

&#8226; 

Quality and Integrity &#160;- We believe in the importance of performing high quality work. Additionally, we believe in maintaining high ethical standards through an established code of conduct and an effective company-wide compliance program. 

&#8226; 

Production &#32;- We believe in the importance of performing tasks safely, efficiently and timely. Additionally, we believe in safeguarding our facilities and equipment and always acting in the best interest of the Company. 

&#8226; 

Sustainability - Our focus on sustainability encompasses many aspects of how we conduct ourselves and practice our core values. We believe sustainability is important to our customers, employees, shareholders, and communities, and is also a long-term business driver. By focusing on specific initiatives that address social, environmental and economic challenges, we can minimize risk and increase our competitive advantage. 

Financial Information About Segments 

The tools used by our chief operating decision maker to allocate resources and assess performance are based on two reportable and operating segments: heavy civil marine construction and commercial concrete construction. 

Although we describe our business in this report in terms of the services we provide, our base of customers and the areas in which we operate, we have determined that our operations currently comprise two &#32;reportable segments pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 280 - Segment Reporting. In previous reporting periods, we reported our financial information based on one &#32;reportable segment, now known as the heavy civil marine construction segment. With our recent acquisition, we have expanded to two &#32;operating and reportable segments, adding the commercial concrete construction segment. 

In making this determination, we considered the similar economic characteristics of our operations. For our heavy civil marine construction segment, the methods used, and the internal processes employed, to deliver our heavy civil marine construction services are similar throughout the segment, including standardized estimating, project controls and project management. This segment has the same types of customers with similar funding drivers, and it complies with regulatory environments driven through Federal agencies such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"), among others. Additionally, the segment is driven by macro-economic considerations including the level of import/export seaborne transportation, development of energy related infrastructure, cruise line expansion and operations, marine bridge infrastructure development, waterway pipeline crossings and the maintenance of waterways. These considerations, and others, are key catalysts for future prospects and are similar across the segment. 

For our newly added commercial concrete construction segment, we also considered the similar economic characteristics of these operations. The methods used, and the internal processes employed to deliver our commercial concrete construction services are similar throughout the segment, including standardized estimating, project controls and project management. This segment complies with regulatory environments such as OSHA. Additionally, this segment is driven by macro-economic considerations, including movements in population, commercial real estate development, institutional funding and expansion, and recreational developments, specifically in metropolitan areas of Texas. These considerations, and others, are key catalysts for future prospects and are similar across the segment. 

Services Provided 

Heavy Civil Marine Construction Service s 

Marine construction services include construction, restoration, maintenance and repair of marine transportation facilities, marine pipelines, bridges and causeways, and marine environmental structures. We have the capability of providing design-build services and typically serve as the prime contractor for these types of projects. 

Marine transportation facility projects include public port facilities for container ship loading and unloading; cruise ship port facilities; private terminals; special-use Navy terminals, recreational use marinas and docks, and other marine-based facilities. These projects typically consist of steel or concrete fabrication dock or mooring structures designed for durability and longevity, and involve driving piles of concrete, pipe or sheet pile to provide a foundation for the port facility structure that we subsequently construct on the piles. We also provide on-going maintenance and repair, inspection services, emergency repair, and demolition and salvage to such facilities. 

Our marine pipeline service projects generally include the installation and removal of underwater buried pipeline transmission lines; installation of pipeline intakes and outfalls for industrial facilities; construction of pipeline outfalls for wastewater and industrial discharges; river crossing and directional drilling; creation of hot taps and tie-ins; and inspection, maintenance and repair services. 

Our bridge and causeway projects include the construction, repair and maintenance of all types of overwater bridges and causeways, as well as the development of fendering systems in marine environments. We serve as the prime contractor for many of these projects, and some of these are design-build contracts. These projects involve fabricating steel or concrete structures designed for durability and longevity, and involve driving concrete, pipe or sheet pile to create support for the concrete deck roadways that we subsequently construct on the piles. These piles can exceed 50 inches in diameter, can range up to 170 feet in overall length, and are often driven 90 feet into the sea floor. 

Marine environmental structure projects may include the installation of concrete mattresses to promote erosion protection; construction of levees to contain environmental mitigation projects, and the installation of geotubes for wetlands and island creation. Such structures are used for erosion control, wetlands creation and environmental remediation. 

Dredging generally enhances or preserves the navigability of waterways or the protection of shorelines through the removal or replenishment of soil, sand or rock. Dredging involves the removal of mud and silt from the channel floor by means of a mechanical backhoe, crane and bucket or cutter suction dredge and pipeline systems. Dredging is integral to marine capital and maintenance projects, including: maintenance for previously deepened waterways and harbors to remove silt, sand and other accumulated sediments; construction of breakwaters, jetties, canals and other marine structures; deepening ship channels and wharves to accommodate larger and deeper draft ships; containing erosion of wetlands and coastal marshes; land reclamation; and beach nourishment and creation of wildlife refuges. Maintenance dredging projects are a source of recurring revenue as active channels typically require dredging every one to three years due to natural sedimentation. The frequency of maintenance dredging may be accelerated by heavy rainfall or major weather events such as hurricanes. Areas where no natural deep water ports exist, such as the Texas Gulf Coast, require substantial maintenance dredging. We maintain multiple specialty dredges of various sizes and specifications to meet customer needs. Our dredging services are typically combined with our marine construction services to provide a turn-key solution for our customers. 

Our specialty services include design, salvage, demolition, surveying, towing, diving and underwater inspection, excavation and repair. Our diving services are largely performed in shallow water and include inspections, salvage and pile restoration and encapsulation. Our survey services include surveying pipelines and performing hydrographic surveys which determine the configuration of the floors of bodies of water and detect and identify wrecks and other obstructions. Most of these specialty services support our other services and provide an introductory opportunity to some customers. 

Commercial Concrete Construction Services 

The commercial concrete construction segment provides its services in the following areas: light commercial, structural, and other services. Light commercial services include horizontally poured concrete for products such as sidewalks, ramps, tilt walls, and trenches. Structural services include elevated concrete pouring for products such as columns, elevated beams, and structural walls. Other services comprise labor related to concrete pouring, such as rebar installation and pumping services. Most of these other services support our other services. These services cover all phases of commercial concrete construction including dirt work and layout, forming, rebar and mesh, and pour and finish. 

Industry and Market Overview 

Heavy Civil Marine Construction 

We provide our services to similar customers, or in some cases, the same customers, across the markets served by our business. Our heavy civil marine construction segment customers may be in diverse end markets, including port expansion and maintenance, bridges, causeways and other marine infrastructure, the recreational waterside industry, the U.S. Department of Defense, the energy industry, coastal protection and reclamation, along with hurricane restoration and repair and environmental remediation. We believe that this broad customer base enables us to lessen the negative effects during a downturn in a specific end market and respond quickly to the needs of expanding end markets. The following includes an overview of our diverse markets in the heavy civil marine construction industry: 

Port Expansion and Maintenance 

Expected increases in cargo volume and future demands from larger ships transiting the expanded Panama Canal will require ports, especially along the Gulf Coast and Atlantic Seaboard, to expand their dock capacity and port infrastructure to accommodate larger container ships and increased cargo volumes, as well as perform additional dredging services to deepen their channels. We provide customers in this sector turnkey services to meet all their port expansion and maintenance work. 

Bridges and Causeways 

According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, as of their most recent report, one in nine of the nation&#8217;s bridges are structurally deficient, and the average age of the nation's bridges is 42 years old. We are able to construct or restore overwater bridges, and design, repair, or replace, fendering systems for customers in this sector. 

Marine Infrastructure 

The U.S. Marine Transportation System (&#8220;MTS&#8221;) consists of waterways, ports and their intermodal connections, vessels, vehicles, and system users, as well as shipyards and repair facilities crucial to maritime activity. The MTS is primarily owned and operated through an aggregation of federal, state, and local governmental authorities, as well as privately owned facilities and private companies. U.S. inland and intracoastal waterways require continuous maintenance and improvement. While waterway usage is increasing, the facilities and supporting systems are aging. In addition, channels and waterways must maintain certain depths to accommodate ship and barge traffic. Natural sedimentation in these channels and waterways require maintenance dredging to maintain navigability. 

Our full business complement, including design, dredging, marine construction, and specialty services, such as diving, survey and inspections are fully utilized by our customers to meet all their marine infrastructure project needs. 

&#160; 

Recreational Waterside Industry 

An expected increase in the number and size of cruise ships has generated a need for substantial port infrastructure development, including planning and construction of new terminals and facilities, as well as on-going maintenance and repair services. These larger vessels require development of new piers and additional dredging services to accommodate deeper drafts. Our service area includes, among others, the ports of Miami, Galveston, Tampa, New Orleans, Canaveral, Juneau, Tacoma, Seattle and the Caribbean Basin, which includes numerous cruise facilities and is the most popular cruise destination in the North American market. 

The Department of Defense and Homeland Security 

The U.S. Navy has the responsibility for the maintenance of 39 facilities in the United States, which includes a significant amount of marine infrastructure. We believe the U.S. Navy will continue to maintain strategic facilities, including the maintenance and upgrades to its marine facility infrastructure. 

The U.S. Coast Guard maintains more than 50,000 federal aids to navigation, which include buoys, lighthouses, day beacons and radio-navigation signals. Additionally, it has oversight responsibility for over 18,000 highway and railroad bridges that span navigable waterways throughout the country. As part of the Department of Homeland Security, we anticipate that the U.S. Coast Guard's needs for varied marine construction services, including those listed above, will provide opportunities for us in the future. 

Energy Industry 

We design, construct, repair and remove underwater pipelines, and provide marine construction and on-going maintenance services for private refineries, terminal facilities and docks, and other critical near shore oil and gas infrastructure. While a number of upstream oil and gas companies have decreased capital expenditures as a result of the recent drop in oil prices, there have been increased levels of capital expenditures by midstream and downstream oil and gas companies in response to higher energy production. This increase should provide opportunities for our services. 

U.S. Coastal and Wetland Restoration and Reclamation 

We believe that increases in coastal population density and demographic trends will lead to an increase in the number of coastal restoration and reclamation projects, and, as the value of waterside assets rises from a residential and recreational standpoint, the private sector, government agencies and municipalities will increase spending on restoration and reclamation projects. 

Hurricane Restoration and Repair 

Hurricanes are often very destructive to the existing marine infrastructure and natural protection barriers of the prime storm areas of the Gulf Coast, the Atlantic Seaboard, and the Caribbean Basin, including bridges, ports, underwater channels and sensitive coastal areas. Typically, restoration and repair opportunities continue for several years after a major hurricane event. These events provide incremental projects to our industry that contribute to a favorable bidding environment and high capacity utilization in our markets during such times. 

Environmental Remediation 

We believe there will be additional funding for the protection of natural habitats, environmental preservation, wetlands creation and remediation for high priority projects in Louisiana and other areas in the markets we serve that will protect and restore sensitive marine and coastal areas, advance ocean science and research, and ensure sustainable use of ocean resources. 

Commercial Concrete Construction 

We provide our services to different customers across the markets served by our business. Our customers in the commercial concrete construction segment are in diverse end markets such as industrial, institutional, commercial real estate, and recreational developments. 

Our commercial concrete construction segment depends on continued growth in population to support residential and nonresidential construction specifically in the metropolitan areas of Texas. The latest estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that the metropolitan areas of Texas, specifically Dallas and Houston, are among the U.S. top 10 in population growth between 2013-2014. These markets show substantial growth in multi-family housing, commercial, office, retail, and industrial buildings, and medical facilities. 

We believe that this broad customer base enables us to lessen the negative effects during a downturn in a specific end market and respond quickly to the needs of expanding end markets. The following includes an overview of our diverse markets in the commercial concrete industry: 

Industrial developments 

Our industrial markets include manufacturing plants, industrial warehousing, distribution centers, waste water treatment facilities and facilities supporting the petrochemical industry. An expected increase in distribution has generated a need for substantial industrial park developments. 

Institutional developments and expansions 

Our institutional markets include educational facilities, medical facilities, museums, and religious developments. Due to significant population growth in the metropolitan areas of Texas, there has been great demand for institutional development and expansion. As the suburban areas of major cities continue to grow, bond programs are passing for new education construction. Additionally, as population and suburban areas grow, so does the continued need for medical facilities. 

Commercial real estate developments 

Our commercial and real estate markets include mid and high-rise multi-family living, single and multi-story office buildings, parking garages, shopping malls, and free standing retail outlets. As population continues to grow, so does the need for retail developments, such as grocery stores, shopping malls, restaurants, and other entertainment venues. Additionally, continued growth in business expansions and relocations to Texas are driving an increase in the need for office space. Apartment complexes continue development in these areas with significant growth. 

Recreational developments 

Our recreational markets include a wide-range of hotels, sports venues, and stadiums. The increase in new businesses and new educational facilities has sparked the need for additional hotels and stadiums across the metropolitan areas of Texas. 

Customers 

Our customers in the heavy civil marine construction segment include federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as private commercial and industrial enterprises in the United States, and the Caribbean Basin. Customers in our commercial concrete construction segment include owners and developers of medical facilities, religious developments, sports complexes and stadiums, school districts and developers, owners of industrial, commercial and residential buildings, and some 

governmental agencies across the metropolitan areas of Texas. Most projects are competitively bid, with the award typically going to the lowest qualified bidder. Our customer base shifts from time to time depending on the types of projects we bid, and ultimately are successful on obtaining.

We do not believe that the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our operations as no specific customer sustains a large portion of our revenue at one time. 

Backlog 

Our contract backlog represents our estimate of the revenues we expect to realize under the portion of the contracts remaining to be performed. Given the typical duration of our contracts, which generally is less than one year, our backlog at any point in time usually represents only a portion of the revenue that we expect to realize during a twelve month period. We include projects in our backlog only when the customer has provided an executed contract, purchase order, change order, or other notice to proceed. 

Backlog for our heavy civil marine construction segment at December 31, 2015 , was $194.3 million , as compared with $215.9 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 . 

Backlog for our commercial concrete construction segment at December 31, 2015 &#32;was $163.3 million , as compared with $145.4 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 . 

These estimates are subject to fluctuations based upon the scope of services to be provided, as well as factors affecting the time required to complete the project. In addition, many projects that make up our backlog may be canceled at any time without penalty; however, we can generally recover actual committed costs and profit on work performed up to the date of cancellation. Although we have not been adversely affected by contract cancellations or modifications materially in the past, we may be so affected in the future, especially during economically uncertain periods. Consequently, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future results. In addition to our backlog under contract, we also have a substantial number of projects in negotiation or pending award at any given time. 

Fluctuations in Quarterly Results 

Our quarterly revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly depending upon the mix, size, scope, and progress schedules of our projects under contract, the productivity of our labor force and the utilization of our equipment. These factors, as well as others affect the rate at which revenue is recognized as projects are completed. 

Competition 

In our heavy civil marine construction segment, we compete with several regional marine construction services companies and a few national marine construction services companies. From time to time, we compete with certain national land-based heavy civil contractors. In our commercial concrete construction segment, we compete mostly in the private sector and our competitors range from small, local construction companies to large, regional, and national construction companies. 

Both of our segments are highly fragmented with competitors generally varying within the markets we serve and with few competitors competing in all of the markets we serve or for all of the services that we provide. We believe that our turnkey capability, expertise, experience and reputation for providing safe and timely quality services, safety record and programs, versatile equipment fleet, financial strength, surety bonding capacity, knowledge of local markets and conditions, and project management and estimating abilities allow us to compete effectively. We believe significant barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate, including the ability to bond large projects, maritime law constraints, specialized marine equipment and technical experience; however, a U.S. company that has adequate financial resources, access to technical expertise, and specialized equipment may become a competitor. 

Insurance and Bonding 

We maintain general and excess liability, construction equipment and workers&#8217; compensation insurance; all in amounts adequate for our operating needs and consistent with industry practice. 

In connection with both segments of the business, we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide security for our performance under certain public and private sector contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon our capitalization, adequate working capital, past performance, management expertise, and external factors, including the capacity of the overall surety market. Surety companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our backlog that we have currently bonded and their own current underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. The capacity of the surety market is subject to market-driven fluctuations driven primarily by the level of surety industry losses and the degree of surety market consolidation. Although we do not believe that fluctuations in surety market capacity have significantly affected our ability to grow our business, there is no assurance that it will not significantly affect our ability to obtain new contracts in the future. The bonds we provide typically are for the contract amount of the project. At December 31, 2015 , our capacity under our current bonding arrangement was in excess of $400.0 million, &#32;of which we had approximately $223.0 million &#32;in surety bonds outstanding. We believe our strong balance sheet and working capital position will allow us to continue to access our bonding capacity. 

Trade Names 

We operate under a number of trade names. We consolidate our operations under the brand name "Orion Marine Group, Inc.". We may be known as Orion Marine Group, Orion Marine Construction, Orion Marine Contractors, Orion Construction, East and West Jones Placement Area, Schneider E&#38;C, Orion Concrete Construction, T.A.S. Commercial Concrete Construction, LLC, T.A.S. Commercial Concrete Solutions, LLC, T.A.S. Proco, LLC, or Houston Industrial Tool Services, as well as our former names of King Fisher Marine Service, T. W. LaQuay Dredging, Misener Marine Construction, Misener Diving &#38; Salvage, F. Miller Construction, Northwest Marine Construction and West Construction. We do not generally register our trademarks with the U.S. Patent &#38; Trademark Office, but instead rely on state and common law protections. While we consider our trade names to be valuable assets, we do not consider any single trademark or trade name to be of such material importance that its absence would cause a material disruption of our business. 

Equipment 

We operate and maintain a large and diverse equipment fleet in our heavy civil marine construction and commercial concrete construction segments, substantially all of which we own, that includes the following: 

&#8226; 

Barges &#160;- spud barges, material barges, deck barges, anchor barges, hopper barges, and fuel barges. These vessels are used to provide work platforms for cranes and other equipment, to transport materials to the project site and to provide support for the project at the project site. 

&#8226; 

Dayboats &#160;- small pushboats, dredge tenders and skiffs are used to shift barges at the project site, to move personnel and to provide general support to the project site. 

&#8226; 

Tugs &#160;- larger pushboats and tug boats are used to transport barges and other support equipment to and from project site. 

&#8226; 

Dredges &#160;- 24&#8221; cutter head suction dredges (diesel), 20&#8221; cutter head suction dredge (diesel/electric), 20&#8221; cutter head suction dredges (diesel), 16&#8221; cutter head suction dredges, and 12&#8221; portable cutter head suction dredges are used to provide dredging services at project sites 

&#8226; 

Cranes &#160;- crawler lattice boom cranes with lift capability from 50 tons to 400 tons and hydraulic rough terrain cranes with lift capability from 15 tons to 60 tons are used to provide lifting and pile driving capabilities on project sites, and to provide bucket work, including mechanical dredging and dragline work, to project sites. 

&#8226; 

Pump Trucks &#32;- concrete pump trucks are large, diesel-powered trucks mounted with a powerful pump, and an extendable, sectioned hose or cylinder to help facilitate the pouring of concrete for construction projects. 

&#8226; 

Laser Screeds &#32;- laser screeds are self-propelled four wheel drive, four wheel steer units that encompass a 20' telescoping boom with a 12' wide placement head. The screed head itself consists of 3 parts: the plow, the auger, and the vibrator. The plow disperses the concrete evenly, the auger removes the excess material to finished grade, and the vibrator smooths the surface. The screed has an on board computer system able to determine the correct elevation height and provide commands for elevation control. 

We believe that ownership of equipment is generally preferable to leasing in some cases because it ensures the equipment is available as needed and normally results in lower costs. We continually monitor and adjust our fleet size so that it is consistent 

with the size of the business, considering both existing backlog and expected future work. We believe that our equipment is well maintained and suitable for our current operations. We have the ability to extend the useful life of our equipment through capital refurbishment at periodic intervals. Most of our fleet is serviced by our own mechanics who work at various maintenance sites and facilities. We are also capable of building, and have built, much of our highly specialized equipment. Our strategy is to move our fleet from project to project as required. The assets (including equipment) are pledged or collateral under the Credit Facility. 

Equipment Certification 

In our heavy civil marine construction segment, some of our equipment requires certification by the U.S. Coast Guard. All equipment which requires certification has obtained such certification and are maintained in good standing thereunder. In addition, where required, our vessels&#8217; permissible loading capacities require certification by the American Bureau of Shipping (&#8220;ABS&#8221;). ABS is an independent classification society which certifies that certain of our larger, seagoing vessels are &#8220;in-class,&#8221; signifying that the vessels have been built and maintained in accordance with ABS standards and applicable U.S. Coast Guard rules and regulations. All of our vessels that are required to be certified by ABS have been certified as &#8220;in-class.&#8221; These certifications indicate that the vessels are structurally capable of operating in open waters, which enhances the mobility of our fleet. 

Government Regulations 

We are required to comply with the macro regulatory requirements of federal, state and local governmental agencies and authorities including the following: 

&#8226; 

regulations concerning workplace safety, labor relations and disadvantaged businesses; 

&#8226; 

licensing requirements applicable to shipping and dredging; and 

&#8226; 

permitting and inspection requirements applicable to marine construction projects. 

In our heavy civil marine construction segment, we are also subject to government regulations pursuant to the Dredging Act, the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, commonly referred to as the "Jones Act", the Shipping Act and the Vessel Documentation Act. These statutes require vessels engaged in the transport of merchandise or passengers between two points in the United States or dredging in the navigable waters of the U.S. to be documented with a coastwise endorsement, to be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens, to be manned by U.S. crews, and to be built in the U.S. The U.S. citizenship ownership and control standards require the vessel-owning entity to be at least 75% U.S. citizen owned, and prohibit the demise or bareboat chartering of the vessel to any entity that does not meet the 75% U.S. citizen ownership test. These statutes, together with similar requirements for other sectors of the maritime industry, are collectively referred to as &#8220;cabotage&#8221; laws. 

In our commercial concrete construction segment, we are subject to the requirements of OSHA and certain regulations for the EPA. 

We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and have all material licenses required to conduct our operations. 

Environmental Matters 

General 

Our marine infrastructure construction, salvage, demolition, dredging and dredge material disposal activities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, including air emissions, water quality, solid waste management, marine and bird species and their habitats, and wetlands. A portion of our construction contracts are entered into with public authorities and frequently impose additional governmental requirements, including requirements regarding labor relations. Our commercial concrete construction infrastructures are subject to the requirements of OSHA and the EPA. 

Such laws and regulations may require that both segments and their customers obtain, and comply with, various environmental permits, registrations, licenses and other approvals. These laws and regulations also can restrict or impact the business activities in many ways, such as delaying the appropriation and performance of particular projects; restricting the way we handle or dispose of wastes; requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by our operations or that are attributable to others; and enjoining some or all of our operations deemed in non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. 

We believe that compliance with existing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Nevertheless, the trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations, including those imposed in response to climate change concerns. As a result, there can be no assurance 

as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. The following is a discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that could have a material effect on our marine and commercial construction and other activities. 

Waste Management 

Our operations could be subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and comparable state laws, which impose detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements. Generators of hazardous wastes must comply with certain standards for the accumulation and storage of hazardous wastes, as well as recordkeeping and reporting requirements applicable to hazardous waste storage and disposal activities. 

Site Remediation 

The Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), also known as &#8220;Superfund,&#8221; and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released, and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations, such as landfills. CERCLA authorizes the EPA, and in some cases third parties, to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, neighboring landowners and other third parties often file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. 

We currently own or lease properties that have been used by other industries for a number of years. Although we typically have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for disposal, or on or under project sites where we perform work. In addition, some of the properties may have been operated by third parties or by previous owners whose treatment and disposal or release of wastes was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination, or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination. 

Water Discharges 

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (&#8220;CWA&#8221;), and analogous state laws impose strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States, including wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The CWA also regulates the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S., and activities that result in such discharge generally require permits issued by the Corps of Engineers. Moreover, above ground storage of petroleum products is strictly regulated under the CWA. Under the CWA, federal and state regulatory agencies may impose administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. 

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (&#8220;OPA&#8221;), which amends and augments the CWA, establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that are sites of releases of oil into waters of the U.S. OPA and its associated regulations impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. For instance, OPA requires vessel owners and operators to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to cover liabilities related to an oil spill for which such parties are statutorily responsible. In addition, the OPA required that certain vessels be outfitted with double hulls by 2015. We believe we are in compliance with all applicable OPA financial responsibility obligations and equipment requirements. 

In 2009, regulations promulgated by the EPA covering certain previously exempt discharges to water from certain marine vessels became effective. The regulations provide for a general permit to cover such discharges and impose on marine vessel operators, including us, certain discharge, permitting, recordkeeping, reporting, monitoring, maintenance, and operating restrictions and requirements with respect to materials that are or may be discharged from certain vessels. Applicability of these restrictions and requirements is based on size and type of vessel, and they apply only to a minority of our vessels. We, nevertheless, are implementing such restrictions and requirements with respect to its vessels which are subject thereto, and we do not anticipate that such regulations or the associated permit terms, restrictions and requirements will adversely impact our business and results of operations. 

Air Emissions 

The Clean Air Act (&#8220;CAA&#8221;) and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including paint booths, and may require pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or require the utilization of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the CAA. 

Climate Change 

The U.S. Congress may consider legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in response to climate change concerns. In addition, several states have declined to wait on Congress to develop and implement climate control legislation and have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by Congress or various states, or the adoption of regulations by the EPA and analogous state agencies that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business could have an adverse effect on our operations and demand for our services. 

Endangered Species 

The Endangered Species Act (&#8220;ESA&#8221;) restricts activities that may affect endangered species or their habitats. We conduct activities in or near areas that may be designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species. For instance, seasonal observation of endangered or threatened West Indian Manatees adjacent to work areas may impact construction operations in Florida during the winter months. Additionally, our dredging operations in Florida are impacted by limitations for placement of dredge spoil materials on designated spoil disposal islands, from April through August of each year, when the islands are inhabited by nesting colonies of protected bird species. Further, restrictions on work during the Whooping Crane nesting period in the Aransas Pass National Wildlife Refuge from October 1 through April 15 each year and during the non-dormant grass season for sea grass in the Laguna Madre from March 1 through November 30 each year impact our construction operations in the Texas Gulf Coast area. We plan our operations and bidding activity with these restrictions and limitations in mind, and they have not materially hindered our business in the past. However, these and other restrictions may affect our ability to obtain work or to complete our projects on time in the future. In addition, while we believe that we are in material compliance with the ESA, the discovery of previously unidentified endangered species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected area. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , our heavy civil marine construction segment had approximately 1,200 &#32;employees, 300 &#32;of whom were full-time salaried personnel and most of the remainder of whom were hourly personnel. Our commercial concrete construction segment had approximately 1,100 &#32;employees, 230 &#32;of whom were full-time salaried personnel and most of the remainder of whom were hourly personnel. 

From time to time, we hire additional employees for certain large projects and, subject to local market conditions, additional crew members are generally available for hire on relatively short notice. We believe our employees are our most valuable resource, and our workforce possesses a strong dedication to and pride in our company. Our employees are not currently represented by labor unions, except certain employees in our heavy civil marine construction segment located in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, in respect of which collective bargaining agreements are in place. Employees represented by collective bargaining agreements represent approximately 5% &#32;of our workforce. Currently, there are no &#32;employees represented by collective bargaining agreements in our commercial concrete construction segment. 

Financial Information About Geographic Areas 

We are a project-driven heavy civil marine and commercial concrete contractor, and our operations represent two reportable segments for financial reporting. Our business is primarily conducted along the coastal regions of the United States for our heavy civil marine construction segment and in the metropolitan areas of Texas for our commercial concrete construction segment. Revenues generated from our heavy civil marine construction segment outside the United States, primarily in the Caribbean Basin and Mexico, totaled 4.1% , 12.9% , and 8.5% &#32;of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Our long-lived assets are substantially located in the United States.
