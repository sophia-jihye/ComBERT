&#160; 

Generation 

&#160; 

Generation, one of the largest competitive electric generation companies in the United States as measured by owned and contracted MW, physically delivers and markets power across multiple geographic regions through its customer-facing business, Constellation. Constellation sells electricity and natural gas, including renewable energy, to both wholesale and retail customers. The retail sales include commercial, industrial and residential customers. Generation leverages its energy generation portfolio to ensure delivery of energy to both wholesale and retail customers under long-term and short-term contracts, and in wholesale power markets. Generation operates in well-developed energy markets and employs an integrated hedging strategy to manage commodity price volatility. Generation&#146;s fleet, including its nuclear plants which consistently operate at high capacity factors, also provides geographic and supply source diversity. These factors help Generation mitigate the challenging conditions emanating from competitive energy markets. Generation&#146;s customers include distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, financial institutions, and commercial, industrial, governmental, and residential customers in competitive markets. Generation&#146;s customer facing activities foster development and delivery of other innovative energy-related products and services for its customers. Generation also engages in natural gas and oil exploration and production activities (Upstream). 

&#160; 

Generation is a public utility under the Federal Power Act and is subject to FERC&#146;s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Under the Federal Power Act, FERC has the authority to grant or deny market-based rates for sales of energy, capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable. FERC&#146;s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the market-based rates of utilities and set cost-based rates should FERC find that its previous grant of market-based rates authority is no longer just and reasonable. Other matters subject to FERC jurisdiction include, but are not limited to, third-party financings; review of mergers; dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility; affiliate transactions; intercompany financings and cash management arrangements; certain internal corporate 

&#160; 

reorganizations; and certain holding company acquisitions of public utility and holding company securities. Additionally, ERCOT is not subject to regulation by FERC but performs a similar function in Texas to that performed by RTOs in markets regulated by FERC. Specific operations of Generation are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other Federal, state, regional and local agencies, including the NRC and Federal and state environmental protection agencies. Additionally, Generation is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC, with the approval of FERC. 

&#160; 

RTOs and ISOs exist in a number of regions to provide transmission service across multiple transmission systems. PJM, MISO, ISO-NE and SPP, have been approved by FERC as RTOs, and CAISO and ISO-NY have been approved as ISOs. These entities are responsible for regional planning, managing transmission congestion, developing wholesale markets for energy and capacity, maintaining reliability, market monitoring, the scheduling of physical power sales brokered through ICE and NYMEX and the elimination or reduction of redundant transmission charges imposed by multiple transmission providers when wholesale customers take transmission service across several transmission systems. 

&#160; 

Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, Inc. 

&#160; 

Generation owns a 50.01% interest in CENG, a joint venture with EDF. CENG is governed by a board of ten directors, five of which are appointed by Generation and five by EDF. CENG owns a total of five nuclear generating facilities on three sites, Calvert Cliffs, R.E. Ginna and Nine Mile Point. CENG&#146;s ownership share in the total capacity of these units is 4,007 MW. See ITEM 2. PROPERTIES for additional information on these sites. 

&#160; 

Generation and EDF also entered into a Put Option Agreement on April 1, 2014, pursuant to which EDF has the option, exercisable beginning on January 1, 2016 and thereafter until June 30, 2022, to sell its 49.99% interest in CENG to Generation for a fair market value price determined by agreement of the parties, or absent agreement, a third-party arbitration process. In addition, under limited circumstances, the period for exercise of the put option may be extended for 18 months. 

&#160; 

Prior to April 1, 2014, Exelon and Generation accounted for their investment in CENG under the equity method of accounting. The transfer of the nuclear operating licenses and the execution of the NOSA on April 1, 2014, resulted in the derecognition of the equity method investment in CENG and the recording of all assets, liabilities and EDF&#146;s noncontrolling interest in CENG at fair value on a fully consolidated basis in Exelon&#146;s and Generation&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 5&#151; Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the integration transaction. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

(a) See &#147;Fuel&#148; for sources of fuels used in electric generation. (b) Net generation capacity is stated at proportionate ownership share. See ITEM 2. PROPERTIES&#151;Generation for additional information. (c) Includes hydroelectric, wind, and solar generating assets. &#160; 

Generation has six reportable segments, the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, New York, ERCOT and Other Power Regions, representing the different geographical areas in which Generation&#146;s customer-facing activities are conducted and where Generation&#146;s generating resources are located. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Mid-Atlantic represents operations in the eastern half of PJM, which includes Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, the District of Columbia and parts of North Carolina (approximately 36% of capacity). 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Midwest represents operations in the western half of PJM, which includes portions of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee; and the United States footprint of MISO (excluding MISO&#146;s Southern Region), which covers all or most of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, and the remaining parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio not covered by PJM; and parts of Montana, Missouri and Kentucky (approximately 37% of capacity). 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; New England represents the operations within ISO-NE covering the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont (approximately 7% of capacity). 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; New York represents the operations within ISO-NY, which covers the state of New York in its entirety (approximately 3% of capacity). 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; ERCOT represents operations within Electric Reliability Council of Texas, covering most of the state of Texas (approximately 11% of capacity). 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Other Power Regions is an aggregate of regions not considered individually significant (approximately 6% of capacity). 

&#160; 

See Note 25&#151;Segment Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on revenues from external customers and revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense for each of Generation&#146;s reportable segments. 

&#160; 

Nuclear Facilities 

&#160; 

Generation has ownership interests in fourteen nuclear generating stations currently in service, consisting of 24 units with an aggregate of 19,460 MW of capacity. Generation wholly owns all of its nuclear generating stations, except for Quad Cities Generating Station (75% ownership), Peach Bottom Generating Station (50% ownership), and Salem Generating Station (Salem) (42.59% ownership), which are consolidated on Exelon&#146;s and Generation&#146;s financial statements relative to its proportionate ownership interest in each unit. In addition, Generation owns a 50.01% interest, collectively, in the CENG generating stations (Calvert Cliffs, Nine Mile Point [excluding LIPA&#146;s 18% ownership interest in Nine Mile Point Unit 2] and R.E. Ginna) which are 100% consolidated on Exelon and Generation&#146;s financial statements as of April 1, 2014. See Note 5&#151;Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

&#160; 

Generation&#146;s nuclear generating stations are all operated by Generation, with the exception of the two units at Salem, which are operated by PSEG Nuclear, LLC (PSEG Nuclear), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of PSEG. In 2015, 2014 and 2013 electric supply (in GWh) generated from the nuclear generating facilities was 68%, 67% and 57%, respectively, of Generation&#146;s total electric supply, which also includes fossil, hydroelectric and renewable generation and electric supply purchased for resale. The majority of this output was dispatched to support Generation&#146;s wholesale and retail power marketing activities. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for further discussion of Generation&#146;s electric supply sources. 

&#160; 

Nuclear Operations. Capacity factors, which are significantly affected by the number and duration of refueling and non-refueling outages, can have a significant impact on Generation&#146;s results of operations. As the largest generator of nuclear power in the United States, Generation can negotiate favorable terms for the materials and services that its business requires. Generation&#146;s operations from its nuclear plants have historically had minimal environmental impact and the plants have a safe operating history. 

&#160; 

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, the nuclear generating facilities operated by Generation achieved capacity factors of 93.7%, 94.3% and 94.1%, respectively. The capacity factors reflect ownership percentage of stations operated by Generation and include CENG as of April 1, 2014. Generation manages its scheduled refueling outages to minimize their duration and to maintain high nuclear generating capacity factors, resulting in a stable generation base for Generation&#146;s wholesale and retail marketing and trading activities. During scheduled refueling outages, Generation performs maintenance and equipment upgrades in order to minimize the occurrence of unplanned outages and to maintain safe, reliable operations. 

&#160; 

In addition to the maintenance and equipment upgrades performed by Generation during scheduled refueling outages, Generation has extensive operating and security procedures in place to ensure the safe operation of the nuclear units. Generation has extensive safety systems in place to protect the plant, personnel and surrounding area in the unlikely event of an accident or other incident. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Nuclear Power Generation. Generation is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC with respect to the operation of its nuclear generating stations, including the licensing for operation of each unit. The NRC subjects nuclear generating stations to continuing review and regulation covering, among other things, operations, maintenance, emergency planning, security and environmental and radiological aspects of those stations. As part of its reactor oversight process, the NRC continuously assesses unit performance indicators and inspection results, and communicates its assessment on a semi-annual basis. As of January 6, 2016, the NRC categorized Clinton and Dresden unit 2 in the Regulatory Response Column, which is the second highest of five performance bands. All other units operated by Generation are categorized in the Licensee Response Column as of December 31, 2015, which is the highest performance band. The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke operating licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, the regulations under such Act or the terms of the operating licenses. Changes in regulations by the NRC may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures for nuclear generating facilities and/or increased operating costs of nuclear generating units. 

&#160; 

On March 11, 2011, Japan experienced a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami that seriously damaged the nuclear units at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, which are operated by Tokyo Electric Power Co. In July 2011, an NRC Task Force formed in the aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi events issued a report of its review of the accident, including recommendations for future regulatory action by the NRC to be taken in the near and longer term. The Task Force&#146;s report concluded that nuclear reactors in the United States are operating safely and do not present an imminent risk to public health and safety. The NRC and its staff have issued orders and implementation guidance for commercial reactor licensees operating in the United States. The NRC and its staff are continuing to evaluate additional requirements. For additional information on the NRC actions related to the Japan Earthquake and Tsunami and the industry&#146;s response, see ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS&#151;Executive Overview. 

&#160; 

Licenses . Generation has 40-year operating licenses from the NRC for each of its nuclear units and has received 20-year operating license renewals for Peach Bottom Units 2 and 3, Dresden Units 2 and 3, Quad Cities Units 1 and 2, Oyster Creek Unit 1, Calvert Cliffs Units 1 and 2, Nine Mile Point Units 1 and 2, R.E. Ginna Unit 1, Three Mile Island Unit 1, Limerick Units 1 and 2, Byron Units 1 and 2 and Braidwood Units 1 and 2. Additionally, PSEG has 40-year operating licenses from the NRC and has received 20-year operating license renewals for Salem Units 1 and 2. On December 8, 2010, Exelon announced that Generation will permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019. The following table summarizes the current operating license expiration dates for Generation&#146;s nuclear facilities in service:

&#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1974 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2034 &#160; &#160;

(a) Denotes year in which nuclear unit began commercial operations. (b) In December 2014, Generation submitted applications to the NRC to extend the operating licenses of LaSalle Units 1 and 2 by 20 years. (c) Stations for which the NRC has issued renewed operating licenses. (d) Although timing has been delayed, Generation currently plans to seek license renewal for Clinton and has advised the NRC that any license renewal application would not be filed until the first quarter of 2021. (e) In December 2010, Exelon announced that Generation will permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019. &#160; 

Generation currently has a license renewal application pending for LaSalle Units 1 and 2. Generation has advised the NRC that any license renewal application for Clinton would not be filed until the first quarter of 2021. The operating license renewal process takes approximately four to five years from the commencement of the renewal process until completion of the NRC&#146;s review. The NRC review process takes approximately two years from the docketing of an application. Each requested license renewal is expected to be for 20 years beyond the original operating license expiration. Depreciation provisions are based on the estimated useful lives of the stations, which reflect the actual and assumed renewal of operating licenses for all of Generation&#146;s operating nuclear generating stations except for Oyster Creek. 

&#160; 

In August 2012, Generation entered into an operating services agreement with the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD) to provide operational and managerial support services for the Fort Calhoun Station and a licensing agreement for use of the Exelon Nuclear Management Model. The terms for both agreements are 20 years. OPPD will continue to own the plant and remain the NRC licensee. 

&#160; 

Nuclear Uprate Program. Generation is engaged in individual projects as part of a planned power uprate program across its nuclear fleet. When economically viable, the projects take advantage of new production and measurement technologies, new materials and application of expertise gained from a half-century of nuclear power operations. Once all projects are completed in 2016, Generation will have placed in-service 538 MWs of new nuclear generation. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, under the nuclear uprate program, Generation has placed into service projects representing 536 MWs of new nuclear generation at a cost of $1,436 million, which has been capitalized to property, plant and equipment on Exelon&#146;s and Generation&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

&#160; 

Nuclear Waste Storage and Disposal. There are no facilities for the reprocessing or permanent disposal of SNF currently in operation in the United States, nor has the NRC licensed any such facilities. Generation currently stores all SNF generated by its nuclear generating facilities in on-site storage pools or in dry cask storage facilities. Since Generation&#146;s SNF storage pools generally do not have sufficient storage capacity for the life of the respective plant, Generation has developed dry cask storage facilities to support operations. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, Generation had approximately 75,800 SNF assemblies (18,800 tons) stored on site in SNF pools or dry cask storage (this includes SNF assemblies at Zion Station, for which Generation retains ownership even though the responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station has been assumed by another party; see Note 16&#151;Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Zion Station Decommissioning). All currently operating Generation-owned nuclear sites have on-site dry cask storage, except for Clinton and Three Mile Island, in which on-site dry cask storage will be in operation at Clinton in 2016 and is projected to be in operation at Three Mile Island in 2023. On-site dry cask storage in concert with on-site storage pools will be capable of meeting all current and future SNF storage requirements at Generation&#146;s sites through the end of the license renewal periods and through decommissioning. 

&#160; 

For a discussion of matters associated with Generation&#146;s contracts with the DOE for the disposal of SNF, see Note 23&#151;Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As a by-product of their operations, nuclear generating units produce LLRW. LLRW is accumulated at each generating station and permanently disposed of at licensed disposal facilities. The Federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 provides that states may enter into agreements to provide regional disposal facilities for LLRW and restrict use of those facilities to waste generated within the region. Illinois and Kentucky have entered into such an agreement, although neither state currently has an operational site and none is anticipated to be operational until after 2020. 

&#160; 

Generation ships its Class A LLRW, which represents 93% of LLRW generated at its stations, to disposal facilities in Utah and South Carolina. The disposal facility in South Carolina at present is only receiving LLRW from LLRW generators in South Carolina, New Jersey (which includes Oyster Creek and Salem), and Connecticut. 

&#160; 

Generation utilizes on-site storage capacity at all its stations to stage for shipping campaigns and store, as needed, Class B and Class C LLRW. Generation has a contract through 2032 to ship Class B 

&#160; 

and Class C LLRW to a disposal facility in Texas. The agreement provides for disposal of all current Class B and Class C LLRW currently stored at each station as well as the Class B and Class C LLRW generated during the term of the agreement. However, because the production of LLRW from Generation&#146;s nuclear fleet will exceed the capacity at the Texas site (3.9 million curies for 15 years beginning in 2012), Generation will still be required to utilize on-site storage at its stations for Class B and Class C LLRW. Generation currently has enough storage capacity to store all Class B and C LLRW for the life of all stations in Generation&#146;s nuclear fleet. Generation continues to pursue alternative disposal strategies for LLRW, including an LLRW reduction program to minimize cost impacts and on-site storage. 

&#160; 

Nuclear Insurance. Generation is subject to liability, property damage and other risks associated with major incidents at any of its nuclear stations, including the CENG nuclear stations. Generation has reduced its financial exposure to these risks through insurance and other industry risk-sharing provisions. See &#147;Nuclear Insurance&#148; within Note 23&#151;Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details. 

&#160; 

For information regarding property insurance, see ITEM 2. PROPERTIES&#151;Generation. Generation is self-insured to the extent that any losses may exceed the amount of insurance maintained or are within the policy deductible for its insured losses. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on Exelon&#146;s and Generation&#146;s financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Decommissioning. NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in specified minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS&#151;Exelon Corporation, Executive Overview; ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Nuclear Decommissioning, Asset Retirement Obligations and Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments; and Note 3&#151;Regulatory Matters, Note 12&#151;Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities and Note 16&#151;Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Generation&#146;s NDT funds and its decommissioning obligations. 

&#160; 

Zion Station Decommissioning. On December 11, 2007, Generation entered into an Asset Sale Agreement (ASA) with EnergySolutions, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, EnergySolutions, LLC (EnergySolutions) and ZionSolutions, LLC (ZionSolutions) under which ZionSolutions assumed responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station, which is located in Zion, Illinois and ceased operation in 1998. 

&#160; 

On September 1, 2010, Generation and EnergySolutions completed the transactions contemplated by the ASA. Specifically, Generation transferred to ZionSolutions substantially all of the assets (other than land) associated with Zion Station, including assets held in related NDT funds. In consideration for Generation&#146;s transfer of those assets, ZionSolutions assumed decommissioning and other liabilities, excluding the obligation to dispose of SNF, associated with Zion Station. Pursuant to the ASA, ZionSolutions will periodically request reimbursement from the Zion Station-related NDT funds for costs incurred related to the decommissioning efforts at Zion Station. However, ZionSolutions is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to request reimbursement; specifically, if certain milestones as defined in the ASA are not met, all or a portion of requested reimbursements shall be deferred until such milestones are met. See Note 16&#151;Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Zion Station Decommissioning and see Note 2&#151;Variable Interest Entities of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of variable interest entity considerations related to ZionSolutions. 

&#160; 

Fossil and Renewable Facilities (including Hydroelectric) 

&#160; 

Generation has ownership interests in 13,281 MW of capacity in fossil and renewable generating facilities currently in service. Generation wholly owns all of its fossil and renewable generating stations, with the exception of: (1) jointly owned facilities that include Wyman; (2) an ownership interest through an equity method investment in Sunnyside; (3) certain wind project entities with minority interest owners; and (4) an ownership interest in the Albany Green Energy, LLC project entity, see Note 2&#151; Variable Interest Entities of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these wind project entities. Generation&#146;s fossil and renewable generating stations are all operated by Generation, with the exception of LaPorte, Sunnyside and Wyman, which are operated by third parties. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, electric supply (in GWh) generated from owned fossil and renewable generating facilities was 8%, 13% and 15%, respectively, of Generation&#146;s total electric supply. The majority of this output was dispatched to support Generation&#146;s wholesale and retail power marketing activities. For additional information regarding Generation&#146;s electric generating facilities, see ITEM 2. PROPERTIES&#151;Exelon Generation Company, LLC and ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS&#151; Exelon Corporation, Executive Overview for additional information on Generation Renewable Development. 

&#160; 

Licenses. Fossil and renewable generation plants are generally not licensed, and, therefore, the decision on when to retire plants is, fundamentally, a commercial one. FERC has the exclusive authority to license most non-Federal hydropower projects located on navigable waterways or Federal lands, or connected to the interstate electric grid. On August 29, 2012 and August 30, 2012, Generation submitted hydroelectric license applications to the FERC for 46-year licenses for the Conowingo Hydroelectric Project (Conowingo) and the Muddy Run Pumped Storage Facility Project (Muddy Run), respectively. On December 22, 2015, FERC issued a new 40-year license for Muddy Run. The license term expires on December 1, 2055. Based on the FERC procedural schedule, the FERC licensing process was not completed prior to the expiration of Conowingo&#146;s license on September 1, 2014. FERC is required to issue an annual license for a facility until the new license is issued. On September 10, 2014, FERC issued an annual license for Conowingo, effective as of the expiration of the previous license. If FERC does not issue a new license prior to the expiration of annual license, the annual license will renew automatically. The stations are currently being depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which includes the license renewal period. Refer to Note 3&#151;Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

&#160; 

Insurance. Generation maintains business interruption insurance for its renewable and fossil projects, and delay in start-up insurance for its renewable and fossil projects currently under construction. Generation does not purchase business interruption insurance for its wholly owned fossil and hydroelectric operations, unless required by financing agreements; see Note 14&#151;Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on financing agreements. Generation maintains both property damage and liability insurance. For property damage and liability claims for these operations, Generation is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on Exelon&#146;s and Generation&#146;s financial condition and their results of operations and cash flows. For information regarding property insurance, see ITEM 2. PROPERTIES&#151;Exelon Generation Company, LLC. 

&#160; 

Long-Term Power Purchase Contracts 

&#160; 

In addition to energy produced by owned generation assets, Generation sources electricity and other related output from plants it does not own under long-term contracts. The following tables summarize Generation&#146;s long-term contracts to purchase unit-specific physical power with an original term in excess of one year in duration, by region, in effect as of December 31, 2015:

&#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

(a) Includes the proportionate share of output where Generation has an undivided ownership interest in jointly-owned generating plants and includes the total output of plants that are fully consolidated (e.g., CENG). Nuclear generation for 2015 and 2014 includes physical volumes of 33,415 GWh and 25,053 GWh, respectively, for CENG. (b) Purchased power for 2015 and 2014 includes physical volumes of 0 GWh and 5,346 GWh, respectively, as a result of the PPA with CENG. On April 1, 2014, Generation assumed operational control of CENG&#146;s nuclear fleet. As a result, 100% of CENG volumes are included in nuclear generation after April 1, 2014. (c) Includes hydroelectric, wind, and solar generating assets. &#160; 

The fuel costs per MWh for nuclear generation are less than those for fossil-fuel generation. Consequently, nuclear generation is generally the most cost-effective way for Generation to meet its wholesale and retail load servicing requirements. 

&#160; 

The cycle of production and utilization of nuclear fuel includes the mining and milling of uranium ore into uranium concentrates, the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, the enrichment of the uranium hexafluoride and the fabrication of fuel assemblies. Generation has uranium concentrate inventory and supply contracts sufficient to meet all of its uranium concentrate requirements through 2018. Generation&#146;s contracted conversion services are sufficient to meet all of its uranium conversion requirements through 2018. All of Generation&#146;s enrichment requirements have been contracted through 2020. Contracts for fuel fabrication have been obtained through 2022. Generation does not anticipate difficulty in obtaining the necessary uranium concentrates or conversion, enrichment or fabrication services to meet the nuclear fuel requirements of its nuclear units. 

&#160; 

Natural gas is procured through long-term and short-term contracts, as well as spot-market purchases. Fuel oil inventories are managed so that in the winter months sufficient volumes of fuel are available in the event of extreme weather conditions and during the remaining months to take advantage of favorable market pricing. 

&#160; 

Generation uses financial instruments to mitigate price risk associated with certain commodity price exposures. Generation also hedges forward price risk, using both over-the-counter and exchange-traded instruments. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 13&#151;Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding derivative financial instruments. 

&#160; 

Power Marketing 

&#160; 

Generation&#146;s integrated business operations include the physical delivery and marketing of power obtained through its generation capacity and through long-term, intermediate-term and short-term contracts. Generation maintains an effective supply strategy through ownership of generation assets and power purchase and lease agreements. Generation has also contracted for access to additional generation through bilateral long-term PPAs. PPAs, including tolling agreements, are commitments related to power generation of specific generation plants and/or are dispatchable in nature similar to asset ownership depending on the type of underlying asset. Generation secures contracted generation as part of its overall strategic plan, with objectives such as obtaining low-cost energy supply sources to meet its physical delivery obligations to both wholesale and retail customers and assisting customers to meet renewable portfolio standards. Generation may also buy power in the market to meet the energy demand of its customers. Generation sells electricity, natural gas, and related products and solutions to various customers, including distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, and commercial, industrial, governmental, and residential customers in competitive markets. Generation&#146;s customer facing operations combine a unified sales force with a customer-centric model that leverages technology to broaden the range of products and solutions offered, which Generation believes promotes stronger customer relationships. This model focuses on efficiency and cost reduction, which provides a platform that is scalable and able to capitalize on opportunities for future growth. 

&#160; 

Generation may purchase more than the energy demanded by its customers. Generation then sells this open position, along with capacity not used to meet customer demand, in the wholesale electricity markets. Where necessary, Generation also purchases transmission service to ensure that it has reliable transmission capacity to physically move its power supplies to meet customer delivery needs in markets without an organized RTO. Generation also incorporates contingencies into its planning for extreme weather conditions, including potentially reserving capacity to meet summer loads at levels representative of warmer-than-normal weather conditions. Additionally, Generation is involved in the development, exploration, and harvesting of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids properties (Upstream). 

&#160; 

Price Supply Risk Management 

&#160; 

Generation also manages the price and supply risks for energy and fuel associated with generation assets and the risks of power marketing activities. Generation implements a three-year ratable sales plan to align its hedging strategy with its financial objectives. Generation also enters into transactions that are outside of this ratable sales plan. Generation is exposed to commodity price risk in 2016 and beyond for portions of its electricity portfolio that are unhedged. Generation has been and will continue to be proactive in using hedging strategies to mitigate this risk in subsequent years. As of December 31, 2015, the percentage of expected generation hedged for the major reportable segments was 90%-93%, 60%-63% and 28%-31% for 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation. 

&#160; 

Expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted for capacity based upon a simulated dispatch model that makes assumptions regarding future market conditions, which are calibrated to market quotes for power, fuel, load following products, and options. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include economic hedges and certain non-derivative contracts, including sales to ComEd, PECO and BGE to serve their retail load. A portion of Generation&#146;s hedging strategy may be implemented through the use of fuel products based on assumed correlations between power and fuel prices, which routinely change in the market. The corporate risk management group and Exelon&#146;s RMC monitor the financial risks of the wholesale and retail power marketing activities. Generation also uses financial and commodity contracts for proprietary trading purposes, but this activity accounts for only a small portion of Generation&#146;s efforts. The proprietary trading portfolio is subject to a risk management policy that includes stringent risk management limits, including volume, stop-loss and value-at-risk limits, to manage exposure to market risk. See ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK for additional information. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, Generation&#146;s short and long-term commitments relating to the purchase of energy and capacity from and to unaffiliated utilities and others were as follows:

Peak Deliveries. ComEd, PECO and BGE electric sales and peak load are generally higher during the summer and winter months, when temperature extremes create demand for either summer cooling or winter heating. For PECO and BGE, natural gas sales are generally higher during the winter months when cold temperatures create demand for winter heating. 

&#160; 

The following table summarizes peak deliveries for ComEd, PECO and BGE for electric and gas deliveries during peak demand months as of December 31, 2015:

Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Services. ComEd, PECO and BGE are allowed to recover reasonable costs and fair and prudent capital expenditures associated with electric and natural gas distribution services and earn a return on those capital expenditures, subject to commission approval. ComEd recovers costs through a performance-based rate formula, pursuant to EIMA. ComEd is required to file an update to the performance-based rate formula on an annual basis. PECO&#146;s and BGE&#146;s electric and gas distribution costs are recovered through traditional rate case proceedings. In certain instances, ComEd, PECO and BGE use specific recovery mechanisms as approved by the ICC, PAPUC, and MDPSC, respectively. 

&#160; 

Through the ICC, ComEd is obligated to deliver electricity to customers in their respective service territories and also retain significant default service obligations (referred to as POLR) to provide electricity to certain groups of customers in their respective service areas who do not choose a competitive electric generation supplier. Through the PAPUC and MDPSC, PECO and BGE, respectively, are obligated to deliver electricity and natural gas to customers in their respective service territories and also retain significant default service obligations (referred to as DSP and SOS for electric and PGC and MBR for natural gas, respectively) to provide electricity or natural gas to certain groups of customers in their respective service areas who do not choose a competitive electric generation supplier or a competitive natural gas supplier. ComEd is permitted to recover electric costs, and PECO and BGE are permitted to recover electric and natural gas procurement costs from retail customers. Therefore, fluctuations in electric and natural gas procurement costs have no impact on electric and natural gas revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense. 

&#160; 

ComEd customers have the choice to purchase electricity, and PECO and BGE customers have the choice to purchase electricity and natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers. The customer&#146;s choice of suppliers does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects revenues collected from customers related to supplied energy and natural gas service. Customer choice program activity has no impact on electric and gas revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense. For those customers that choose a competitive electric generation or natural gas supplier, ComEd, PECO and BGE may act as the billing agent but do not record revenues or purchased power and fuel expense related to the electric and natural gas procurement costs. ComEd, PECO and BGE remain the distribution service providers for all customers in their respective service territories and charge a regulated rate for distribution service. 

&#160; 

Retail customers participating in customer choice programs, and retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers (as a percentage of GWh and mmcf sales, respectively) for ComEd, PECO and BGE consisted of the following at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:

(a) In September 2015, the City of Chicago discontinued its participation in the customer choice program and began purchasing its electricity from ComEd. Approximately 670,000 customers were impacted by the City of Chicago&#146;s decision which resulted in the reduction in the number of customers participating in customer choice programs in 2015. &#160; 

Procurement-Related Proceedings. ComEd&#146;s, PECO&#146;s and BGE&#146;s electric supply for its customers is primarily procured through contracts as required by the ICC, PAPUC and MDPSC, respectively. ComEd, PECO and BGE procure electricity supply from various approved bidders, including Generation. Charges incurred for electric supply procured through contracts with Generation are included in Purchased power from affiliates on ComEd&#146;s, PECO&#146;s and BGE&#146;s Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 

&#160; 

PECO&#146;s and BGE&#146;s natural gas supplies are purchased from a number of suppliers for terms of up to three years. PECO and BGE have annual firm supply from transportation contracts of 132,000 mmcf and 128,000 mmcf, respectively. In addition, to supplement gas supply at times of heavy winter demands and in the event of temporary emergencies, PECO and BGE have available storage capacity from the following sources: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; Peak Natural Gas Sources (in mmcf) &#160; &#160; &#160; Liquefied Natural Gas Facility &#160; &#160; Propane-Air Plant &#160; &#160; Underground Storage Service Agreements &#160;(a) &#160; PECO

(a) Natural gas from underground storage represents approximately 28% and 31% of PECO and BGE&#146;s 2015-2016 heating season planned supplies, respectively. &#160; 

PECO and BGE have long-term interstate pipeline contracts and also participate in the interstate markets by releasing pipeline capacity or bundling pipeline capacity with gas for off-system sales. Off-system gas sales are low-margin direct sales of gas to wholesale suppliers of natural gas. Earnings from these activities are shared between the utilities and customers. PECO and BGE make these sales as part of a program to balance its supply and cost of natural gas. 

&#160; 

Energy Efficiency Programs. ComEd, PECO and BGE are also allowed to recover costs associated with energy efficiency and demand response programs. Each commission approved program seeks to meet mandated electric consumption reduction targets and implement demand response measures to reduce peak demand. The programs are designed to meet standards required by each respective regulatory agency. 

&#160; 

Capital Investment. ComEd&#146;s, PECO&#146;s and BGE&#146;s businesses are capital intensive and requires significant investments, primarily in electric transmission and distribution and natural gas transportation and distribution facilities, to ensure the adequate capacity, reliability and efficiency of its system. ComEd&#146;s, PECO&#146;s and BGE&#146;s most recent estimates of capital expenditures for plant additions and improvements for 2016 are $2,425 million, $675 million and $825 million, respectively. 

&#160; 

ComEd, PECO and BGE each have ICC, PAPUC and MDPSC, respectively, approved smart meter and smart grid deployment programs to enhance their distribution systems. The following table summarizes ComEd&#146;s smart meter and PECO&#146;s and BGE&#146;s smart meter and smart grid technology spending and meter installations as of December 31, 2015:

(a) ComEd has committed to invest approximately $2.6 billion over a ten year period to modernize and storm-harden its distribution system and to implement smart grid technology. These amounts represent capital expenditures associated with ComEd&#146;s commitment. (b) PECO will seek recovery of costs associated with PECO&#146;s gas AMI through the traditional rate case process. (c) BGE is seeking recovery of its smart grid initiative costs as part of its 2015 electric and gas distribution rate case. See Note 3&#151;Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. &#160; 

Transmission Services. ComEd, PECO and BGE provide unbundled transmission service under rates approved by FERC. FERC has used its regulation of transmission to encourage competition for wholesale generation services and the development of regional structures to facilitate regional wholesale markets. Under FERC&#146;s open access transmission policy promulgated in Order No. 888, ComEd, PECO and BGE, as owners of transmission facilities, are required to provide open access to their transmission facilities under filed tariffs at cost-based rates. ComEd, PECO and BGE are required to comply with FERC&#146;s Standards of Conduct regulation governing the communication of non-public information between the transmission owner&#146;s employees and wholesale merchant employees. 

&#160; 

PJM is the ISO and the FERC-approved RTO for the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. PJM is the transmission provider under, and the administrator of, the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff (PJM Tariff). PJM operates the PJM energy, capacity and other markets, and, through central dispatch, controls the day-to-day operations of the bulk power system for the PJM region. ComEd, PECO and BGE are members of PJM and provide regional transmission service pursuant to the PJM Tariff. ComEd, PECO, BGE and the other transmission owners in PJM have turned over control of their transmission facilities to PJM, and their transmission systems are currently under the dispatch control of PJM. Under the PJM Tariff, transmission service is provided on a region-wide, open-access basis using the transmission facilities of the PJM members at rates based on the costs of transmission service. 

&#160; 

ComEd &#146;s and BGE&#146;s transmission rates are established based on a formula that was approved by FERC in January 2008 and April 2006, respectively. FERC&#146;s order establishes the agreed-upon treatment of costs and revenues in the determination of network service transmission rates and the process for updating the formula rate calculation on an annual basis. 

&#160; 

PECO&#146;s customers are charged for PECO&#146;s PJM retail transmission services on a full and current basis through a Transmission Service Charge (applicable to default service only) and through a Non-Bypassable Transmission Charge (applicable to all distribution customers) in accordance with PECO&#146;s approved distribution rates.

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE are subject to comprehensive and complex legislation regarding environmental matters by the federal government and various state and local jurisdictions in which they operate their facilities. The Registrants are also subject to regulations administered by the EPA and various state and local environmental protection agencies. Federal, state and local regulation includes the authority to regulate air, water, and solid and hazardous waste disposal. 

&#160; 

The Exelon Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the management of environmental matters. Exelon has a management team to address environmental compliance and strategy, including the CEO; the Senior Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Chief Sustainability Officer; the Corporate Environmental Strategy Director and the Environmental Regulatory Strategy Director, as well as senior management of Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE. Performance of those individuals directly involved in environmental compliance and strategy is reviewed and affects compensation as part of the annual individual performance review process. The Exelon Board of Directors has delegated to its corporate governance committee the authority to oversee Exelon&#146;s compliance with laws and regulations and its strategies and efforts to protect and improve the quality of the environment, including Exelon&#146;s climate change and sustainability policies and programs, as discussed in further detail below. The Exelon Board of Directors has also delegated to its Generation Oversight Committee the authority to oversee environmental, health and safety issues relating to Generation. The respective Boards of ComEd, PECO and BGE, which each include directors who also serve on the Exelon Board of Directors, oversee environmental, health and safety issues related to ComEd, PECO and BGE. 

&#160; 

Air Quality 

&#160; 

Air quality regulations promulgated by the EPA and the various state and local environmental agencies in Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas in accordance with the Federal Clean Air Act impose restrictions on emission of particulates, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), mercury and other pollutants and require permits for operation of emissions sources. Such permits have been obtained by Exelon&#146;s subsidiaries and must be renewed periodically. The Clean Air Act establishes a comprehensive and complex national program to substantially reduce air pollution from power plants.

&#160; 

Water Quality 

&#160; 

Under the Clean Water Act, NPDES permits for discharges into waterways are required to be obtained from the EPA or from the state environmental agency to which the permit program has been delegated and must be renewed periodically. Certain of Generation&#146;s power generation facilities discharge industrial wastewater into waterways and are therefore subject to these regulations and operate under NPDES permits or pending applications for renewals of such permits after being granted an administrative extension. Generation is also subject to the jurisdiction of certain other state and regional agencies and compacts, including the Delaware River Basin Commission and the Susquehanna River Basin Commission. 

&#160; 

Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act. Section 316(b) requires that the cooling water intake structures at electric power plants reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts, and is implemented through state-level NPDES permit programs. All of Generation&#146;s power generation facilities with cooling water systems are subject to the regulations. Facilities without closed-cycle recirculating systems (e.g., cooling towers) are potentially most affected by changes to the existing regulations. For Generation, those facilities are Calvert Cliffs, Clinton, Dresden, Eddystone, Fairless Hills, Ginna, Gould Street, Handley, Mountain Creek, Mystic 7, Nine Mile Point Unit 1, Oyster Creek, Peach Bottom, Quad Cities, Riverside, Salem and Schuylkill. 

&#160; 

On October 14, 2014, the EPA&#146;s final Section 316(b) rule became effective. The rule requires that a series of studies and analyses be performed to determine the best technology available to minimize adverse impacts on aquatic life, followed by an implementation period for the selected technology. The timing of the various requirements for each facility is related to the status of its current NPDES permit and the subsequent renewal period. There is no fixed compliance schedule, as this is left to the discretion of the state permitting director. 

&#160; 

Until the compliance requirements are determined by the applicable state permitting director on a site-specific basis for each plant, Generation cannot estimate the effect that compliance with the rule will have on the operation of its generating facilities and its future results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. Should a state permitting director determine that a facility must install cooling towers to comply with the rule, that facility&#146;s economic viability would be called into question. However, the potential impact of the rule has been significantly reduced since the final rule does not mandate cooling towers as a national standard and sets forth technologies that are presumptively compliant, and the state permitting director is required to apply a cost-benefit test and can take into consideration site-specific factors. 

&#160; 

New York Facilities . In July 2011, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) issued a policy regarding the best available technology for cooling water intake structures. Through its policy, the DEC established closed-cycle cooling or its equivalent as the performance goal for all existing facilities, but also provided that the DEC will select a feasible technology whose costs are not wholly disproportionate to the environmental benefits to be gained and allows for a site-specific determination where the entrainment performance goal cannot be achieved. The Ginna and Nine Mile Point Unit 1 power generation facilities received renewals of their state water discharge permits in 2014. 

&#160; 

Salem. In June 2001, the NJDEP issued a renewed NPDES permit for Salem, expiring in July 2006, allowing for the continued operation of Salem with its existing cooling water system. In February 2006, PSEG filed a renewal application with the NJDEP allowing Salem to continue operating under its existing NPDES permit until a new permit was issued. On June 30, 2015, NJDEP issued a draft NPDES permit for Salem. The draft permit does not require installation of cooling towers and allows Salem to continue to operate utilizing the existing once-through cooling water system with certain required system modifications. The draft permit was subject to a public notice and comment period and the NJDEP may make revisions before issuing the final permit expected during the first half of 2016. 

&#160; 

Solid and Hazardous Waste 

&#160; 

CERCLA provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the EPA in the event of threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment and authorizes the EPA either to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have created actual or potential environmental hazards or to order persons responsible for the situation to do so. Under CERCLA, generators and transporters of hazardous substances, as well as past and present owners and operators of hazardous waste sites, are strictly, jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs of waste at sites, most of which are listed by the EPA on the National Priorities List (NPL). These PRPs can be ordered to perform a cleanup, can be sued for costs associated with an EPA-directed cleanup, may voluntarily settle with the EPA concerning their liability for cleanup costs, or may voluntarily begin a site investigation and site remediation under state oversight prior to listing on the NPL. Various states, including Illinois, Maryland and Pennsylvania, have also enacted statutes that contain provisions substantially similar to CERCLA. In addition, RCRA governs treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and cleanup of sites where such activities were conducted. 

&#160; 

Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE and their subsidiaries are, or are likely to become, parties to proceedings initiated by the EPA, state agencies and/or other responsible parties under CERCLA and RCRA with respect to a number of sites, including MGP sites, or may undertake to investigate and remediate sites for which they may be subject to enforcement actions by an agency or third-party. 

&#160; 

See Note 23&#151;Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding solid and hazardous waste regulation and legislation. 

&#160; 

Environmental Remediation 

&#160; 

ComEd&#146;s, PECO&#146;s and BGE&#146;s environmental liabilities primarily arise from contamination at former MGP sites. ComEd, pursuant to an ICC order, and PECO, pursuant to settlements of natural gas distribution rate cases with the PAPUC, have an on-going process to recover environmental remediation costs of the MGP sites through a provision within customer rates. While BGE does not have a rider for MGP clean-up costs, BGE has historically received recovery of actual clean-up costs on a site-specific basis in distribution rates. The amount to be expended in 2016 at Exelon for compliance with environmental remediation related to contamination at former MGP sites and other gas purification sites is expected to total $38 million, consisting of $32 million and $6 million respectively, at ComEd and PECO. 

&#160; 

Generation&#146;s environmental liabilities primarily arise from contamination at current and former generation and waste storage facilities. As of December 31, 2015, Generation has established an appropriate liability to comply with environmental remediation requirements including contamination attributable to low level radioactive residues at a storage and reprocessing facility named Latty Avenue, and at a disposal facility named West Lake Landfill, both near St. Louis, Missouri related to operations conducted by Cotter Corporation, a former ComEd subsidiary. 

&#160; 

In addition, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE may be required to make significant additional expenditures not presently determinable for other environmental remediation costs. 

&#160; 

See Notes 3&#151;Regulatory Matters and 23&#151;Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Registrants&#146; environmental remediation efforts and related impacts to the Registrants&#146; results of operations, cash flows and financial positions. 

&#160; 

Global Climate Change 

&#160; 

Exelon believes the evidence of global climate change is compelling and that the energy industry, though not alone, is a significant contributor to the human-caused emissions of GHGs that many in the scientific community believe contribute to global climate change, and as reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in their Fifth Assessment Report Summary for Policy Makers issued in September 2013. Exelon, as a producer of electricity from predominantly low-carbon generating facilities (such as nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar photovoltaic), has a relatively small GHG emission profile, or carbon footprint, compared to other domestic generators of electricity. By virtue of its significant investment in low-carbon intensity assets, Generation&#146;s emission intensity, or rate of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emitted per unit of electricity generated, is among the lowest in the industry. Exelon does produce GHG emissions, primarily at its natural gas-fired generating plants; CO2, methane and nitrous oxide are all emitted in this process, with CO2 representing the largest portion of these GHG emissions. GHG emissions from combustion of fossil fuels represent the majority of Exelon&#146;s direct GHG emissions in 2015, although only a small portion of Exelon&#146;s electric supply is from fossil generating plants. Other GHG emission sources at Exelon include natural gas (methane) leakage on the natural gas systems, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) leakage in its electric transmission and distribution operations and refrigerant leakage from its chilling and cooling equipment as well as fossil fuel combustion in its motor vehicles and fossil fuel generation of electricity used to power its facilities. Despite its focus on low-carbon generation, Exelon believes its operations could be significantly affected by the possible physical risks of climate change and by mandatory programs to reduce GHG emissions. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for information regarding the market and financial, regulatory and legislative, and operational risks associated with climate change. 

&#160; 

Climate Change Regulation. Exelon is, or may become, subject to climate change regulation or legislation at the Federal, regional and state levels. 

&#160; 

International Climate Change Regulation. At the international level, the United States is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Parties to the UNFCCC adopted the Paris Agreement at the 21 st session of the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP 21) on December 12, 2015. The Paris Agreement defines the UNFCCC&#146;s objective of limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5&#176;C above pre-industrial levels. All Parties are required to develop their own national emission reductions and to update those reductions at least every five years. The Developed Country Parties, including the United States, are required to take the lead by undertaking economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets. The United States had previously submitted its national emission reductions to achieve a 2020 target of reducing net emissions in the range of 17% below the 2005 level and to achieve net greenhouse gas emission reductions of 26%&#151;28% below the 2005 level by 2025. The United States has indicated that it intends to achieve these reductions through a variety of mechanisms, including regulations to cut carbon pollution from new and existing power plants. The Paris Agreement will enter into force on the thirtieth day after the date on which at least 55 Parties accounting for at least an estimated 55% of total global greenhouse gas emissions have ratified the Agreement. 

&#160; 

Federal Climate Change Legislation and Regulation. It is highly uncertain that Federal legislation to reduce GHG emissions will be enacted. If such legislation is adopted, Exelon may incur costs either to further limit or offset the GHG emissions from its operations or to procure emission allowances or credits. In June 2013, the White House released the President&#146;s Climate Action Plan which consists of a wide variety of executive actions targeting GHG reductions, preparing for the impacts of climate change and showing leadership internationally; but the plan did not directly trigger any new requirements or legislative action. 

&#160; 

The EPA is addressing the issue of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions regulation for new and existing electric generating units through the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) under 

&#160; 

Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. Pursuant to the Climate Action Plan, President Obama directed the EPA to regulate new and modified fossil fired generating units under Section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act. The EPA finalized the rule in August 2015, and the final rule has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. 

&#160; 

Under the President&#146;s memorandum, the EPA was also required to finalize a rule to establish CO 2 emission reduction requirements for existing fossil-fuel generating stations under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The final rule, known as the Clean Power Plan, became effective on December 22, 2015. The rule sets GHG emission reduction targets for each state, with reductions beginning in 2022, and the target achieved by 2030. States must submit an implementation plan to the EPA by September 2016, unless granted an extension of up to two years. States are granted latitude to select from a number of compliance options, which are designed to achieve the reductions in the most cost-effective manner. The final rule has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. On February 9, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the Clean Power Plan until the disposition of the petitions challenging the rule now before the Court of Appeals, and, if such petitions are filed in the future, before the U.S. Supreme Court. While the ultimate impact of the Clean Power Plan rule is expected to be favorable, Exelon and Generation cannot at this time predict to what extent the states&#146; actions to comply with the Clean Power Plan&#146;s emission reduction targets will impact their future financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

&#160; 

Regional and State Climate Change Legislation and Regulation. After a two-year program review, the nine northeast and mid-Atlantic states currently participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Initiative (RGGI) released an updated RGGI Model Rule and Program Review Recommendations Summary on February 7, 2013. Under the updated RGGI program the regional RGGI CO 2 budget was reduced, starting in 2014, from its previous 165 million ton level to 91 million tons, with a 25 percent reduction in the cap level each year from 2015 through 2020. Included in the program are provisions for cost containment reserve (CCR) allowances, which will become available if the total demand for allowances, above the CCR trigger price, exceeds the number of CO 2 allowances available for purchase at auction. (CCR trigger prices are $6 in 2015, $8 in 2016 and $10 in 2017; after 2017 the CCR price increases by 2.5 percent each year). Such an outcome could put modest upward pressure on wholesale power prices; however, the specifics are currently uncertain. 

&#160; 

At the state level, the Illinois Climate Change Advisory Group, created by Executive Order 2006-11 on October 5, 2006, made its final recommendations on September 6, 2007 to meet the Governor&#146;s GHG reduction goals. At this time, the only requirements imposed by the state of Illinois are the energy efficiency and renewable portfolio standards in the Illinois Power Act that apply to ComEd. 

&#160; 

On December 18, 2009, Pennsylvania issued the state&#146;s final Climate Change Action Plan. The plan sets as a target a 30 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2020. The Climate Change Advisory Committee continues to meet quarterly to review Climate Action Work Plans for the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. The Climate Change Action Plan does not impose any requirements on Generation or PECO at this time. 

&#160; 

The Maryland Commission on Climate Change was chartered in 2007 and released a greenhouse gas reduction strategy with 42 recommendations on August 27, 2008. The plan&#146;s primary policy recommendation to formally adopt science-based regulatory goals to reduce Maryland&#146;s GHG emissions was realized with the passage of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Act of 2009 (GGRA) which requires Maryland to reduce its GHG emissions by 25 percent below 2006 levels by 2020. It also directed the Maryland Department of Environment to prepare and implement an action plan which was published in October of 2013. Maryland&#146;s electricity consumption reduction goals, required under the &#147;EmPOWER Maryland&#148; program, and mandatory State participation in RGGI Program, are listed as the energy sector&#146;s contribution in the plan. The plan also advocated raising the renewable portfolio standard requirement from 20% by 2022 to 25% by 2022. The Department of Environment was required to submit a December 2015 report to the Governor and General Assembly 

&#160; 

on progress towards the 25% mandate; its costs and benefits; the need for target adjustments; and the status of federal programs. In 2016, the Legislature will review the progress report, its economic impacts on manufacturing sector and other information and determine whether to continue, adjust or eliminate the requirement to achieve a 25% reduction by 2020. 

&#160; 

Exelon&#146;s Voluntary Climate Change Efforts . In a world increasingly concerned about global climate change and regulatory action to reduce GHG, Exelon&#146;s low-carbon generating fleet is seen by management as a competitive advantage. Exelon remains one of the largest, lowest carbon electric generators in the United States: nuclear for base load, natural gas for marginal and peak demand, hydro and pumped storage, and supplemental wind and solar renewables. As further legislation and regulation imposing requirements on emissions of GHG and air pollutants are promulgated, Exelon&#146;s low-carbon, low-emission generation fleet will position the company to benefit from its comparative advantage over other generation fleets. 

&#160; 

Renewable and Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards 

&#160; 

Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia have adopted some form of RPS requirement. Illinois, Pennsylvania and Maryland have laws specifically addressing energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives. In addition to state level activity, RPS legislation has been considered and may be considered again in the future by the United States Congress. Also, states that currently do not have RPS requirements may adopt such legislation in the future. 

&#160; 

Illinois utilities are required to procure cost-effective renewable energy resources in amounts that equal or exceed 2% of the total electricity that each electric utility supplies to its eligible retail customers. ComEd is also required to acquire amounts of renewable energy resources to cumulatively increase this percentage to at least 10% by June 1, 2015 and an ultimate target of at least 25% by June 1, 2025. All goals are subject to rate impact criteria set forth by Illinois legislation. As of December 31, 2015, ComEd had purchased sufficient renewable energy resources or equivalents, such as RECs, to comply with the Illinois legislation. ComEd currently retires all RECs upon transfer and acceptance. ComEd is permitted to recover procurement costs of RECs from retail customers without mark-up through rates. 

&#160; 

The AEPS Act became effective for PECO on January 1, 2011. During 2015, PECO was required to supply approximately 5.0% of electric energy generated from Tier I alternative energy resources (including solar, wind power, low-impact hydropower, geothermal energy, biologically derived methane gas, fuel cells, biomass energy, coal mine methane and black liquor generated within Pennsylvania), as measured in AECs, through May 31, 2015 and subsequently 5.5% beginning June 1, 2015 and continuing through May 31, 2016. PECO was also required to supply 6.2% of electric energy generated from Tier II alternative energy resources (including waste coal, demand-side management, large-scale hydropower, municipal solid waste, generation of electricity utilizing wood and by-products of the pulping process and wood, distributed generation systems and integrated combined coal gasification technology), as measured in AECs, through May 31, 2015 and subsequently 8.2% beginning June 1, 2015 and continuing through May 31, 2016. The compliance requirements will incrementally escalate to 8.0% for Tier I and 10.0% for Tier II by 2021. In order to comply with these requirements, PECO entered into agreements with varying terms with accepted bidders, including Generation, to purchase non-solar Tier I, solar Tier 1 and Tier II AECs. PECO also purchases AECs through its DSP Program full requirement contracts. 

&#160; 

Section 7-703 of the Public Utilities Article in Maryland sets forth the RPS requirement, which applies to all retail electricity sales in Maryland by electricity suppliers. The RPS requirement requires that suppliers obtain a specified percentage of the electricity it sells from Tier 1 sources (solar, wind, biomass, methane, geothermal, ocean, fuel cell, small hydroelectric, and poultry litter) and Tier 2 

&#160; 

sources (hydroelectric, other than pump storage generation, and waste-to-energy). The RPS requirement began in 2006, requiring that suppliers procure 1.0% and 2.5% from Tier 1 and Tier 2 sources, respectively, escalating in 2022 to 22.0% from Tier 1 sources, including at least 2.0% from solar energy, and a phase out of Tier 2 resource options by 2022. In 2015, 10.5% was required from Tier 1 renewable sources, including at least 0.5% derived from solar energy and 2.5% from Tier 2 renewable sources. BGE is subject to requirements established by the Public Utilities Article in Maryland related to the use of alternative energy resources; however, the wholesale suppliers that supply power to BGE through SOS procurement auctions have the obligation, by contract with BGE, to meet the RPS requirements. 

&#160; 

Similar to ComEd, PECO and BGE, Generation&#146;s retail electric business must source a portion of the electric load it serves in many of the states in which it does business from renewable resources or approved equivalents such as RECs. Potential regulation and legislation regarding renewable and alternative energy resources could increase the pace of development of wind and other renewable/alternative energy resources, which could put downward pressure on wholesale market prices for electricity in some markets where Exelon operates generation assets. At the same time, such developments may present some opportunities for sales of Generation&#146;s renewable power, including from wind, solar, hydroelectric and landfill gas.
