For purposes of this annual report on Form 10-K, &#8220;Vince,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our,&#8221; refer to Vince Holding Corp. (&#8220;VHC&#8221;) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, including Vince Intermediate Holding, LLC and Vince, LLC.

Overview

Vince is a leading contemporary fashion brand best known for modern effortless style and everyday luxury essentials. Founded in 2002, the brand now offers a wide range of women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s apparel, women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s footwear, and handbags. Vince products are sold in prestige distribution worldwide, including approximately 2,500 distribution points across 38 countries. While we have recently experienced a slowdown in sales growth, we believe that we can generate growth by improving our product offering, expanding our selling into international markets, and growing our own branded retail and our e-commerce direct-to-consumer businesses. We have a small number of wholesale partners who account for a significant portion of our net sales. Net sales to the full-price, off-price and e-commerce operations of our three largest wholesale partners were 43%, 49% and 46% of our total revenue for fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively. These partners include Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, each accounting for more than 10% of our total revenue for fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. We design our products in the U.S. and source the vast majority of our products from contract manufacturers outside the U.S., primarily in Asia and South America.

We serve our customers through a variety of channels that reinforce the Vince brand image. Our diversified channel strategy allows us to introduce our products to customers through multiple distribution points that are reported in two segments: wholesale and direct-to-consumer. Our wholesale segment is comprised of sales to major department stores and specialty stores in the U.S. and in select international markets, with U.S. wholesale representing 56%, 67% and 71% of our fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 sales, respectively, and the total wholesale segment representing 67%, 76% and 79% of our sales in those same periods. We believe that our success in the U.S. wholesale channel and our strong relationships with premier wholesale partners provide opportunities for further growth. These growth initiatives include creating enhanced product assortments and brand extensions through both in-house development activities and licensing arrangements, as well as continuing the build-out of branded shop-in-shops in select wholesale partner locations. We also believe international wholesale, which represented 10%, 9% and 8% of net sales for fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively, presents a significant growth opportunity as we strengthen our presence in existing geographies and introduce Vince in new markets globally. Our wholesale segment also includes our licensing business related to our licensing arrangements for our women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s footwear.

Our direct-to-consumer segment includes our company-operated retail and outlet stores and our e-commerce business. In 2008, we initiated a direct-to-consumer strategy with the opening of our first retail store. During fiscal 2015, we opened 11 new stores consisting of six full-price retail stores and five outlet locations. As of January 30, 2016, we operated 48 stores, consisting of 34 company-operated full-price retail stores and 14 company-operated outlet locations. The direct-to-consumer segment also includes our e-commerce website, www.vince.com , which was launched in 2008 and re-launched with enhancements to the website during fiscal 2014. The direct-to-consumer segment accounted for 33%, 24% and 21% of fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 net sales, respectively. We expect sales from this channel to continue to grow as we drive productivity in existing stores, open new stores and continue to make improvements in our e-commerce business.

Vince operates on a fiscal calendar widely used by the retail industry that results in a given fiscal year consisting of a 52 or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31 of the following year.

Vince Holding Corp., previously named Apparel Holding Corp., was incorporated in Delaware in February 2008 in connection with the acquisition of Kellwood Company by affiliates of Sun Capital Partners, Inc. (&#8220;Sun Capital&#8221;). In September 2012, Kellwood Company formed Vince, LLC and all assets constituting the Vince business were contributed to Vince, LLC at such time (the &#8220;Vince Transfer&#8221;). On November 27, 2013, Apparel Holding Corp. was renamed Vince Holding Corp. in connection with the consummation of the IPO. Certain restructuring transactions were completed in connection with the consummation of the IPO. These transactions, among other things, included Kellwood Holding, LLC acquiring the non-Vince businesses, which include Kellwood Company, LLC, from the Company; and the Company continues to own and operate the Vince business, which includes Vince, LLC. The restructuring 

transactions separated the Vince and non-Vince businesses on November 27, 2013. Any and all debt obligations outstanding at the time of the restructuring transactions either remained with Kellwood Holding, LLC and its subsidiaries (i.e. the non-Vince businesses) and/or were discharged, repurchased or refinanced in connection with the consummation of the IPO. Historical financial information for the non-Vince businesses has been presented as a component of discontinued operations, u ntil the businesses were separated on November 27, 2013, in this annual report on Form 10-K and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included herein. Our principal executive office is located at 500 Fifth Avenue, 20th Floor, New York, Ne w York 10110 and our telephone number is (212) 515-2600. Our corporate website address is www.vince.com . 

Brand and Products

Vince is a leading contemporary fashion brand best known for modern effortless style and everyday luxury essentials. The Vince brand was founded in 2002 with a collection of stylish women&#8217;s knits and cashmere sweaters that rapidly attracted a loyal customer base drawn to the casual sophistication and luxurious feel of our products. Over the last decade, Vince has generated strong sales momentum and has successfully grown to include a men&#8217;s collection in 2007, expanded our leather and outerwear offerings and launched a women&#8217;s handbag line in 2014. In addition, through licensing partnerships, we launched women&#8217;s footwear in 2012 and men&#8217;s footwear in 2014. The Vince brand is synonymous with a clean, timeless aesthetic, sophisticated design and superior quality. We believe these attributes have generated strong customer loyalty and have enabled us to hold a distinctive position among contemporary fashion brands. We also believe that we will achieve continued success by expanding our product assortment and distributing this expanded product assortment through our premier wholesale partners in the U.S. and select international markets, as well as through our growing number of branded retail locations and on our e-commerce platform.

Since our inception in 2002, we have offered contemporary apparel with a focus on clean and authentic design and superior quality. We believe that our differentiated design aesthetic and strong attention to detail and fit allow us to maintain premium pricing, and that the combination of quality and value positions Vince as an everyday luxury brand that encourages repeat purchases among our customers.

The women&#8217;s collection under the Vince brand includes seasonal collections of luxurious cashmere sweaters and silk blouses, leather and suede leggings and jackets, dresses, denim, pants, tanks and t-shirts, and a growing assortment of outerwear. The men&#8217;s collection under the Vince brand includes t-shirts, knit and woven tops, sweaters, denim, pants, blazers, outerwear and stylish leather jackets. Other primarily includes handbags and revenues earned under our licensing arrangements for footwear.

We have identified additional brand extension opportunities, including elevating our men&#8217;s collection and expanding outerwear, women&#8217;s pants and dresses. In addition, through our licensing arrangements, we also offer women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s footwear. We continue to evaluate other brand extension opportunities through both in-house development activities as well as through potential licensing arrangements with third parties.

Design and Merchandising

We are focused on developing an elevated collection of Vince apparel and accessories that build upon the brand&#8217;s product heritage of modern, effortless style and everyday luxury essentials. The current design vision is to create a cohesive and compelling product assortment with sophisticated head-to-toe looks for multiple wear occasions. In November 2015, we entered into consulting agreements with our co-founders, Rea Laccone and Christopher LaPolice, with initial terms of two years, to oversee our product, merchandising and creative efforts. Our design efforts are also supported by well-established product development and production teams and processes that enable us to bring new products to market quickly. We are looking to further build our merchant capabilities and believe continued collaboration between design and merchandising will ensure we respond to consumer preferences and market trends with new innovative product offerings while maintaining our core fashion foundation.

Business Segments 

We serve our customers through a variety of channels that reinforce the Vince brand image. Our diversified channel strategy allows us to introduce our products to customers through multiple distribution points that are reported in two segments: wholesale and direct-to-consumer.

Wholesale Segment

Our wholesale segment is comprised of sales to major department stores and specialty stores in the U.S. and in select international markets, with U.S. wholesale representing 56%, 67% and 71% in fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 and international wholesale representing 10%, 9% and 8% of our net sales for those same periods. Our products are currently sold in 38 countries. As of January 30, 2016, our products were sold to consumers at 2,441 doors through our wholesale partners. In addition, we also have shop-in-shops which are operated by our domestic and international wholesale partners where we sell the merchandise to the partners on a wholesale basis, recognizing revenue upon shipment of goods when title and risk of loss passes to the wholesale partner. The shop-in-shops are dedicated spaces within the selling floors of select domestic and international wholesale partners where Vince product is prominently displayed and sold. Vince generally provides the shop-in-shop fixtures needed to build out the spaces within the department stores operated by our wholesale partners. As of January 30, 2016, there were 53 shop-in-shops consisting of 33 shop-in-shops with our U.S. wholesale partners and 20 shop-in-shops with our international wholesale partners. We also have one international free-standing store in Tokyo that is owned and operated through a distribution arrangement whereby Vince provides the merchandise to the distribution partner for sale in the free-standing store which solely sells Vince product. Our wholesale segment also includes our licensing business related to our licensing arrangements for our women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s footwear line. Under these licensing arrangements we launched women&#8217;s footwear in fiscal 2012 and in fiscal 2014 we launched men&#8217;s footwear. The licensed products are sold in our own stores and by our licensee to select wholesale partners, and we earn a royalty based on net sales to the wholesale partners.

Direct-to-Consumer Segment

Our direct-to-consumer segment includes our company-operated retail and outlet stores and our e-commerce business. In 2008, we initiated a direct-to-consumer strategy with the opening of our first retail store. As of January 30, 2016, we operated 48 stores, which consisted of 34 company-operated full-price retail stores and 14 company-operated outlet locations. The direct-to-consumer segment also includes our e-commerce website, www.vince.com , which was launched in 2008 and re-launched with website enhancements during fiscal 2014. The direct-to-consumer segment accounted for approximately 33%, 24% and 21% of fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 net sales, respectively. We expect sales from this channel to continue to grow as we drive productivity in existing stores, open new stores and continue to make improvements in our e-commerce business.

Marketing, Advertising and Public Relations

We use marketing, advertising and public relations as critical tools to deliver a consistent and compelling brand message to consumers. Our brand message and marketing strategies are cultivated by dedicated creative, design, marketing, visual merchandising and public relations teams. These teams work closely together to develop and execute campaigns that appeal to both our core and aspirational customers.

To execute our marketing stra tegies, w e engage in a wide range of campaign tactics that include traditional media ( such as direct mail, print advertising, cooperative advertising with wholesale partners and outdoor advertising), digital media ( such as email , search and social display ) and experiential campaigns (such as events and collection previews) to drive traffic , brand awareness, conversion and ultimately sales across all channels. 

In fiscal 2015, we believe these strategies increased our brand awareness and grew our customer and email databases. Email now drives approximately one-third of our e-commerce business and growth of our database continues to be a key to our success. We use social platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest to engage customers and create excitement about our brand. In addition, the growing number of visits to www.vince.com , which totaled 5.6 million in fiscal 2015, representing a 45% increase from fiscal 2014, provides an opportunity to grow our customer base and communicate directly with our customers.

Our public relations team conducts a wide variety of press activities to reinforce the Vince brand image and create excitement around the brand. Vince apparel, handbags and footwear have appeared in the pages of major fashion magazines such as Vogue, Harper&#8217;s Bazaar , Elle, W, GQ , Esquire and Vanity Fair . Well-known trend setters in entertainment and fashion are also regularly seen wearing the Vince brand.

Sourcing and Manufacturing

Vince does not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We contract for the purchase of finished goods with manufacturers who are responsible for the entire manufacturing process, including the purchase of piece goods and trim. Although we do not have long-term written contracts with manufacturers, we have long-standing relationships with a diverse base of vendors which we believe to be mutually satisfactory. We work with over 30 manufacturers across five countries, with 89% of our products produced in China in fiscal 2015. For cost and control purposes, we contract with select third-party vendors in the U.S. to produce a small portion of our merchandise that includes woven pants and products manufactured with man-made fibers.

All of our garments are produced according to our specifications, and we require that all of our manufacturers adhere to strict regulatory compliance and standards of conduct. Our vendors&#8217; factories are monitored by our production team to ensure quality control, and they are monitored by independent third-party inspectors we employ for compliance with local manufacturing standards and regulations on an annual basis. Our quality assurance staff in the U.S. and Asia also monitors our vendors&#8217; manufacturing facilities regularly, providing technical assistance and performing in-line and final audits to ensure the highest possible quality.

Shared Services Agreement

In connection with the consummation of the IPO, Vince, LLC entered into a shared services agreement with Kellwood Company, LLC on November 27, 2013 (the &#8220;Shared Services Agreement&#8221;) pursuant to which Kellwood Company, LLC would provide certain support services in various operational areas including, among other things, e-commerce operations, distribution, logistics, information technology, accounts payable, credit and collections and payroll and benefits. Since the IPO, we have been working on transitioning certain back office functions performed by Kellwood under the Shared Services Agreement. Among these functions that have transitioned to Vince are certain accounting related functions as well as benefits administration. We have also been working on developing our own information technology infrastructure and are now in the process of implementing our own enterprise resource planning (&#8220;ERP&#8221;) system, point-of-sale systems, e-commerce platform and supporting systems. We are also in the process of migrating our U.S. distribution system from Kellwood to a new third party provider. Until those systems are implemented, we will continue to utilize the Kellwood information technology infrastructure, including e-commerce platform systems, under the Shared Services Agreement. Refer to the discussion under &#8220;Information Systems&#8221; below for further information on our ERP implementation. See also &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Kellwood provides us with certain key services for our business, which we are in the process of transitioning to our own systems and processes. If Kellwood fails to perform its obligations to us during the period of transition or if we cannot successfully transition these services to our own systems, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially harmed.&#8221; In addition, see &#8220;Shared Services Agreement&#8221; under Note 15 &#8220;Related Party Transactions&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K for further information.

Distribution Facilities

Pursuant to the Shared Services Agreement, Kellwood has provided distribution facilities and services to us in the U.S. These services included distribution, storage and fulfillment. In November 2015, we entered into a service agreement with a new third-party distribution provider and commenced the migration of the distribution facility from Kellwood in the first quarter of 2016. Kellwood will continue to provide these services to us through a transition period until such time as we terminate the provision of such services in accordance with the terms of the Shared Services Agreement. See &#8220;Shared Services Agreements&#8221; under Note 15 &#8220;Related Party Transactions&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Shared Services Agreement.

As of January 3 0 , 201 6 , we operated out of three distribution centers, two located in the U.S. and one in Belgium. The primary warehouse operated by Kellwood is located in City o f Industry, California, and included 75,000 square feet dedicated to fulfilling orders for our wholesale partners and retail locations. An adjacent warehouse span ning 22,000 square feet supported Vince&#8217; s e-commerce business . Our space in both of the California warehouses utilize warehouse ma nagement systems that are fully customer and vendor compliant and are completely integrated with our current ERP and accounting systems. The new distribution center will be located in City o f Industry, California and will have approximately 100,000 square feet of dedicated space to fulfill orders for our wholesale partners , our retail locations and our e-commerce business. 

The warehouse in Belgium is operated by a third-party logistics provider and supports our wholesale orders for customers located primarily in Europe. The warehouse management systems of the Belgium warehouse are integrated with our current ERP systems to provide us with near real-time visibility into our international distribution.

We believe we have sufficient capacity in our domestic and international distribution facilities to support our continued growth.

Information Systems

Kellwood has continued to provide certain information technology services to us and will continue to do so until such time as we elect to terminate provision of such services in accordance with the terms of the Shared Services Agreement. These services included information technology planning and administration, desktop support and help desk, our ERP system, financial applications, warehouse systems, reporting and analysis applications and our retail and e-commerce interfaces. 

The ERP system we current use under the Shared Services Agreement was developed from a core system that is widely used in the apparel and fashion industry, which was customized to suit our inventory management and order processing requirements. Oracle Financials has been integrated with the ERP system to meet our financial reporting and accounting requirements. Additionally, we use a suite of third-party hosted retail applications integrated with the ERP system that provide us with merchandising, retail inventory management, point-of-sale systems (&#8220;POS&#8221;), customer relationship management and retail accounting, all of which are currently used under the Shared Services Agreement. The ERP and warehouse management systems are also integrated with a hosted, third-party e-commerce platform. We have commenced the development and implementation of our own ERP, POS and supporting systems and network infrastructure, engaged with a new e-commerce platform provider and completed the migration of the human resource recruitment system. The ERP, POS, e-commerce platform and supporting system implementations are expected to be completed in 2016. Our new ERP system is operated on a system from Microsoft Dynamics AX and is cloud based and will integrate with our new POS, e-commerce platform and other supporting systems. Collectively, these systems will replace the current ERP, Oracle Financials and all other systems currently used under the Shared Services Agreement. Once implemented, we will no longer rely on Kellwood&#8217;s information technology services.

See &#8220;&#8212;Shared Services Agreement,&#8221; above and &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; Kellwood provides us with certain key services for our business, which we are in the process of transitioning to our own systems and processes. If Kellwood fails to perform its obligations to us during the period of transition or if we cannot successfully transition these services to our own systems, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially harmed.&#8221; In addition, see &#8220;Shared Services Agreement&#8221; under Note 15 &#8220;Related Party Transactions&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on form 10-K for further information.

Seasonality

The apparel and fashion industry in which we operate is cyclical and, consequently, our revenues are affected by general economic conditions and the seasonal trends characteristic to the apparel and fashion industry. Purchases of apparel are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the level of consumer spending, including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates, consumer confidence as well as the impact from adverse weather conditions. In addition, fluctuations in sales in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting direct-to-consumer sales; as such, the financial results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the fiscal year.

Competition

We face strong competition in each of the product categories and markets where we compete on the basis of style, quality, price and brand recognition. Some of our competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial, marketing, distribution and other resources than us. However, we believe that we have established a sustainable advantage and distinct position in the current marketplace, driven by a product assortment that combines classic and fashion-forward styling, and a pricing strategy that offers customers accessible luxury. Our competitors are varied but include Theory, Helmut Lang, Rag &#38; Bone, Joie, J Brand, James Perse and J. Crew, among others.

Employees 

As of January 30, 2016, we had 565 employees, of which 340 were employed in our company-operated retail stores. Except for two employees in France, who are covered by collective bargaining agreements pursuant to French law, none of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our employee relations are good.

Trademarks and Licensing

We own the Vince trademark for the production, marketing and distribution of our products in the U.S. and internationally. We have registered the trademark domestically and have registrations on file or pending in a number of foreign jurisdictions. We intend to continue to strategically register, both domestically and internationally, trademarks that we use today and those we develop in the future. We license the domain name for our website, www.vince.com , pursuant to a license agreement. Under this license agreement, we have an exclusive, irrevocable license to use the www.vince.com domain name without restriction at a nominal annual cost. While we may terminate such license agreement at our discretion, the agreement does not provide for termination by the licensor. We also own unregistered copyright rights in our design marks.
