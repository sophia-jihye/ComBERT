 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

COMPANY HISTORY 

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 2, 2001 under the name Altus Explorations Inc. (Altus) as a company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of oil and natural gas properties. The company has not been able to secure sufficient financing to act on oil and gas investment opportunities as they were identified. Therefore, we did very little business and showed very limited activity, with no profitability. In September 2010 we chose to enter the expanding field of training of peace and law enforcement officers as well as other professionals involved in the fields of security and safety oriented civilian training at both the individual and corporate levels. and entered into an agreement, in principle, to purchase Canadian Tactical Training Academy Inc. from UWD Unitas World Development Inc. (&#34;UNITAS&#34;), a private Canadian company. We refer to this asset purchase transaction as the Acquisition. On October 1, 2010, Altus entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the &#34;Agreement&#34;) with Unitas. Pursuant to the Agreement, Altus issued 80,000,000 shares of common stock for the acquisition of 450 shares of common stock of The Canadian Tactical Training Academy Inc., representing 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, which were held by UWD. Further, Altus changed its name to Canadian Tactical Training Academy Inc. (CTTA) (the Company subsequently changed its name to Earth Life Sciences Inc.) and increased the authorized share capital from 40,000,000 to 250,000,000 shares of common stock and then further from 250,000,000 to 450,000,000. The Company assumed the business Canadian Tactical Training Academy Inc., which is the training of law enforcement, security, investigation and protection for officers and high-profile individuals.

To reflect the nature of our new business, we changed our corporate name on November 4, 2010 from Altus Explorations Inc. to Canadian Tactical Training Academy Inc. Our principal executive offices are now located at 7000 Chemin Cote de Liesse, Suite 8, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H4T 1E7 and our telephone number is (514) 373-8411.
