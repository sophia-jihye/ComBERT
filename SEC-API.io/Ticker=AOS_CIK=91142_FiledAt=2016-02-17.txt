 ITEM 1 - BUSINESS 

Our company is comprised of two reporting segments: North America and Rest of World. Our Rest of World segment is primarily comprised of China, Europe and India. Both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas, gas tankless and electric water heaters. Both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective regions of the world. Our North America segment also manufactures and globally markets specialty commercial water heating equipment, condensing and non-condensing boilers and water systems tanks. Primarily for Asia, our Rest of World segment also manufactures and markets water treatment products. We also market in-home air purification products in China. 

On August 22, 2011, we sold our Electrical Products business (EPC) to Regal Beloit Corporation (RBC) for approximately $760 million in cash and approximately 2.83 million shares of RBC common stock valued at $140.6 million as of that date. Due to the sale, EPC has been reflected as a discontinued operation in the accompanying financial information for all periods presented.

&#160; NORTH AMERICA 

Sales in our North America segment increased 5.0 percent or $81.3 million in 2015 compared with the prior year. The sales increase in 2015 was the result of price increases in the U.S. and Canada for residential and commercial water heaters and higher volumes of commercial water heaters and condensing commercial boilers in the U.S. Lower volumes of U.S. residential water heaters and lower water heater sales in Canada, primarily due to a decline in the value of the Canadian dollar of approximately thirteen percent versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset these favorable factors. Our Lochinvar brand, which we acquired in August 2011, incrementally added approximately $143 million of sales in 2012 compared to 2011. Approximately 40 percent of Lochinvar-branded sales consist of residential and commercial water heaters while the remaining 60 percent of Lochinvar-branded sales consist primarily of boilers and related parts. 

We serve residential and commercial end markets in North America with a broad range of products including: 

Water heaters . Our residential and commercial water heaters come in sizes ranging from 2.5 gallon (point-of-use) models to 12,500 gallon products with varying efficiency ranges. We offer electric, natural gas, gas tankless and liquid propane models as well as solar tank units. Our North American residential water heater sales in 2015 were approximately $1.1 billion or 62 percent of North America sales. Typical applications for our water heaters include residences, restaurants, hotels and motels, office buildings, laundries, car washes and small businesses. 

Boilers. Our residential and commercial boilers range in size from 40,000 British Thermal Units (BTUs) to 5.0 million BTUs. Our commercial boilers are used primarily in space heating applications for hospitals, schools, hotels and other large commercial buildings. 

Other. Our North America segment also manufactures expansion tanks, commercial solar water heating systems, swimming pool and spa heaters, and related products and parts. 

A significant portion of the sales in our North America segment is derived from the replacement of existing products. 

We are the largest manufacturer and marketer of water heaters in North America, and we have a leading share in both the residential and commercial markets. In the commercial market, we believe our comprehensive product line including boilers 

&#160;

and our high-efficiency products give us a competitive advantage in this portion of the water heating industry. Our wholesale distribution channel includes more than 1,200 independent wholesale plumbing distributors with more than 4,400 selling locations serving residential and commercial end markets. We also sell our residential water heaters through the retail channel. In this channel, our customers include five of the seven largest national hardware and home center chains, including long-standing exclusive relationships with both Lowe&#146;s and Sears. Our boiler distribution channel is primarily comprised of manufacturer representative firms. 

Our Lochinvar brand is one of the leading brands of residential and commercial boilers in the U.S. 

Our energy efficient product offerings continue to be a sales driver for our business. Our Cyclone product family and our condensing boilers continue to be an option for commercial customers looking for high efficiency water and space heating with a short payback period through energy savings. We offer residential heat pump, condensing tank-type and tankless water heaters in North America, as well as other higher efficiency water heating solutions to round out our energy efficient product offerings. 

We sell our water heating products in highly competitive markets. We compete in each of our targeted market segments based on product design, reliability, quality of products and services, advanced technologies, product performance, maintenance costs and price. Our principal water heating and boiler competitors in North America include Rheem, Bradford White, Rinnai, Aerco and Navien. Numerous other manufacturing companies also compete. 

REST OF WORLD 

Sales in our Rest of World segment increased 12.7 percent, or $97.8 million, in 2015 compared with the prior year. A 13.7 percent increase in sales in China to $789.2 million was the primary source of the increase. Excluding the impact from the stronger U.S. dollar, China sales increased 16.1 percent in 2015. 

We have operated in China for 20 years. In that time, we have been aggressively expanding our presence while building A. O. Smith brand recognition in the Chinese residential and commercial markets. The Chinese water heater market is predominantly comprised of electric wall-hung, solar and gas tankless water heaters. We believe we are one of the leading suppliers of water heaters to the residential market in China, with a broad product offering including electric, gas, gas tankless, heat pump and solar units as well as combi boilers. Primarily for Asia, we also manufacture and market water treatment products. We also market air purification products primarily for the residential market in China. 

We sell water heaters in more than 8,000 retail outlets in China, of which over 2,000 exclusively sell our products. Our water treatment products and air purification products are sold in over 5,500 and 1,200 retail outlets in China, respectively. Our online sales continue to grow in China and in 2015 reached $140 million. 

In 2008, we established a sales office in India and began importing products specifically designed for India from our China operations. We began manufacturing water heaters in India in 2010. Our sales in India were $15.9 million in 2015 compared with $15.1 million in 2014. 

Our primary competitor in China is Haier Appliances, a Chinese company, but we also compete with Midea in the electric water heater and water treatment markets and Rinnai and Noritz in the gas tankless and solar water heater markets. Additionally, we compete with numerous other Chinese private and state-owned water heater and water treatment companies in China. In India, we compete in the water heater and water treatment markets. We compete with Bajaj and MTS-Racold in the water heater market and Eureka Forbes and Kent in the water treatment market. 

In addition, we sell water heaters in the European and Middle Eastern markets and water treatment products in Turkey, all of which combined comprised less than seven percent of total Rest of World sales in 2015. 

RAW MATERIALS 

Raw materials for our manufacturing operations, primarily consisting of steel, are generally available in adequate quantities. A portion of our customers are contractually obligated to accept price changes based on fluctuations in steel prices. There has been volatility in steel costs over the last several years. 

&#160;

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

To improve our competitiveness by generating new products and processes, we conduct research and development at our Corporate Technology Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at our Global Engineering Center in Nanjing, China, and at our operating locations. Our total expenditures for research and development in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $73.7 million, $67.9 million and $57.8 million, respectively. 

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS 

We own and use in our businesses various trademarks, trade names, patents, trade secrets and licenses. We do not believe that our business as a whole is materially dependent upon any such trademark, trade name, patent, trade secret or license. However, our trade name is important with respect to our products, particularly in China, India and the U.S. 

EMPLOYEES 

We employed approximately 13,400 employees as of December 31, 2015, primarily non-union. 

BACKLOG 

Due to the short-cycle nature of our businesses, none of our operations sustains significant backlogs. 

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS 

Our operations are governed by a variety of federal, foreign, state and local laws intended to protect the environment. Compliance with environmental laws has not had and is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of our company. See Item 3.
