As used herein, &#8220;CPI&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; and similar terms refer to CPI Card Group Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a leading provider of comprehensive Financial Payment Card solutions in North America. We define &#8220; Financial Payment Cards &#8221; as credit, debit and Prepaid Debit Cards issued on the networks of the &#8220; Payment Card Brands &#8221; (Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover) and Interac (in Canada). In 201 5 , we produced over 156.6 million EMV Financial Payment Cards and provided integrated card services to over 3,250 card - issuing banks. We define &#8220;Prepaid Debit Cards&#8221; as debit cards issued on the networks of the Payment Card Brands, but not linked to a traditional bank account. We have established a leading position in the Financial Payment Card market through more than 20 years of experience and are focused primarily on this growing subsector of the financial technology market. Our customers are pri marily leading national and regional banks, independent community banks, credit unions, managers of prepaid debit programs, &#8220; Group Service Providers &#8221; (organizations that assist small card issuers, such as credit unions, with managing their credit and debit card programs, including managing the Financial Payment Card issuance process) and card processors. We serve a diverse set of over 4,000 direct and indirect customers, including many of the largest North American issuers of debit and credit cards such as JPMorgan Chase, B ank of America and Wells Fargo, the largest global managers of Prepaid Debit Card programs, including InComm, Green Dot, Blackhawk Network and American Express, as well as thousands of independent community banks, credit unions, Group Service Providers and card processors. 

&#160; 

We serve our customers through a network of ten production and card services facilities, including eight high - security facilities in North America , each of which is certified by one or more of the Payment Card Brands and Interac (in Canada) and, where required by our customers, certified to be in compliance with the standards of the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (the &#8220; PCI Security Standards Council &#8221;) . We have the largest such network of high - security production facilities in North America, allowing us to optimize our solutions offerings to serve the needs of our diverse and long - term customer base. 

&#160; 

We estimate that we produce approximately 35 % of all Finan cial Payment Cards in the United States, which we believe gives us the &#160; #1 market position by unit volume. We believe we have: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the #1 position in the U.S. prepaid debit market (which represents the fastest growing subset of the Financial Payment Card m arket in the United States), serving the top five U.S. Prepaid Debit Card program managers; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

a leading position in the U.S. large issuer market, serving the majority of the top 20 U.S. debit and credit card issuers; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the #1 position in the highly attractive U.S. small issuer market, which includes independent community banks and credit unions, driven by our strong relationships, capabilitie s and technologies. 

&#160; 

We have grown our business significantly over the past decade, both organically and through acquisitions. Over that time period, we have completed six acquisitions, significantly increasing our geographic and market coverage, solutions offerings and capacity. On March 9, 2010, we purchased certain assets of Premier Card Solutions, a leading provider of Financial Payment Cards, data personalization services and tamper - evident security packaging for Prepaid Debit Cards that utilize the payment networks of the Payment Card Brands. The Premier Card Solutions transaction significantly enhanced our offering to Prepaid Debit Card customers. On September 2, 2014, we acquired EFT Source, a recognized leader in the financial technology industry that was named to American Banker and Bank Administration Institute&#8217;s FinTech Forward 100 in &#160; 2013 , 2014 and 201 5 . The acquisition of EFT Source significantly enhanced our card services offering, added Card@Once &#174; to our instant issuance card offering and expanded our end - to - end Financial Payment Card solutions. 

&#160; 

&#160;

In addition to our eight North American facilities, we have two facilities in the United Kingdom that produce retail cards, such as gift and loyalty cards , that are not issued on the networks of the Payment Card Brands, and personalization services. 

&#160; 

In 2015, we generated : 

&#183; 

Net sales of $ 374. 1 million, wh ich represented an increase of 43. 3 % compared to the prior year , 

&#183; 

Net income from continuing operations of $31.3 million, which re presented an increase of 95.7 % compared to the prior year, 

&#183; 

Adjusted EBITDA of $ 9 6.2 million, wh ich represented an increase of 77.5 % compared to the prior year , 

&#183; 

N et income from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA margins of 8.4 % and 25.7 %, respectively. 

&#160; 

Our 2014 results include four months of results from EFT Source. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are financial measures not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income from continuing operations, the mos t comparable GAAP measure, see Part III, Item 6, Selected Financial Data . 

&#160; 

Our business consists of the following reportable segments : U.S. Debit and Credit , which primarily produces Financial Payment Cards and provides integrated card services to card-issuing banks in the United States; U.S. Prepaid Debit , which primarily provides integrated card services to Prepaid Debit Card issuers in the United States; and U.K. Limited , which primarily produces retail cards, such as gift and loyalty cards for customers in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, and which are not certified by any of the Payment Card Brands or to be in compliance with &#160; the standards of the PCI Security Standards Council . Businesses not considered part of these segments are categorized as "Other" and include our operations in Ontario, Canada and Petersfield, United Kingdom . &#160; &#160; In August 2015, we completed the shut down and closure of our operations at our Petersfield , United Kingdom facility. The Petersfield , United Kingdom facility is not material to our business. Also included in &#8220;Other&#8221; is our corporate headquarters. 

&#160; 

For information regarding our net sales by geographic location and additional details regarding our segments, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 19 "Segment Reporting," and Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Our Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Leading Market Position with Long - Term Customer Relationships. As a market leader, we have long - standing trust - based relationships with our key customers and often deep process and technology integration, particularly in the case of customers who utilize our card services and instant issuance systems and services. The solutions that we provide require strict data integrity, and generally card issuers are reluctant to switch away from trusted providers due to the requirements for high - security and access to highly - sensitive cardholder information. As a result, our customers are selective about the partners with which they work and typically seek out partners who have a well - established reputation for trust and quality and are able to meet their service requirements. 

&#160; 

We have long - standing relationships with our customers, many of whom we have served for decades and provide a differentiated level of service, as evidenced by our strong net pro moter score, a customer satisfaction metric developed through customer satisfaction surveys conducted by an independent market research firm. We also maintain important relationships with the Payment Card Brands to ensure our facilities and processes consistently meet their standards. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Well Positioned for EMV Conversion in the United States. As a leading provider of integrated credit, debit and Prepaid Debit Card solutions in North America, we are well - positioned to capitalize on the U.S. market conversion to the Europay, Mastercard and Visa (&#8220; EMV &#8221;) chip technology. EMV is a global, technical standard, mainta ined by EMV Co for smart payment cards , and for payment terminals and automated teller machines that accept them. EMV cards are smart cards (also called chip cards) which store data on integrated circuits rather than magnetic stripes, although EMV cards may have magnetic stripes . EMV cards c an be contact cards that must be physically inserted (or &#8220; dipped&#8221;) into a reader, contactless cards 

&#160;

that can be read over a short distance using radio-frequency identification (&#8220;RFID&#8221;) technology, or cards with both contact and contactless functionality (&#8220;dual-interface EMV cards&#8221;) . We serve our customers through a network of ten production and card services facilities, including eight high - security facilities in North America that are each certified by one or more of the Payment Card Brands, Interac (in Canada) and, w here required by our customers, certified to be in compliance with the standards of the PCI Security Standards Council. We have made significant investments in our physical infrastructure and equipment platform to prepare for the EMV conversion , including opening a dedicated EMV technology center in Colorado for EMV Financial Payment Card production and personalization , and significant information technology, human capital and equipment upgrades across our network of facilities. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Comprehensive End - to - End Card Solutions Drive Deep Customer Integration. The foundation of our strong market position is our comprehensive end - to - end Financial Payment Card solutions. Our solutions provide a full suite of products and card services required to produce, personalize and fulfill Financial Payment Cards, while maintaining the stringent security requirements of the Payment Card Brands. We are integral to many of our customers&#8217; card programs, pairing card production with an end - to - end offering of card data personalization and card services that are deeply integrated within our customers &#8217; operations. We provide card data personalization services for financial institutions and managers of Prepaid Debit Card programs that require extensive technology integration, such as secure data links to transfer highly sensitive cardholder information. Similarly, our installed base of instant issuance systems at bank and credit union branches across the United States require comparable levels of customer integration , as our Card@Once &#174; instant issuance system utilizes only our secure technology to instantly personalize cards. Certain customers have also integrated our proprietary software into their customer - facing websites to offer card design and customization to their cardholders. We believe that our comprehensive solution allows our customers to choose a single trusted partner to address their card program needs in a cost - effective manner instead of managing multiple suppliers across a complex value chain. We believe our customers choose and retain us for these critical functions, which typically require integrations that are costly and complex , due to our reputation as a trusted partner, our high levels of service and proven execution. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Certified Network of North American High - Security Facilities. Our eight high - security North American facilities are each certified by one or more of the Payment Card Brands and Interac (in Canada), forming the largest network of certified production facilities in North America. The Payment Card Brand certifications allow us to produce cards bearing these brands and provide relevant card services for our issuer customers. Additionally, many of our facilities are also certified &#160; to be in compliance with the standards of the PCI Security Standards Council . These certification processes are long, complex and costly, and our facilities must comply with strict standards of security in order to obtain and retain this designation, which are regularly verified by both the Payment Card Brands and our customers. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Industry Experience and Proprietary and Patented Solutions. Over the course of our long operating history, we have developed extensive technological, engineering and operational expertise that we believe has made us a leader in our industry for product and process know - how. We believe that our technological and operational know - how, combined with our specific focus on the Financial Payment Card market, gives us a competitive advantage and fosters a culture of innovation. We have developed and acquired significant intellectual property over our operating history and hold 19 U.S. patents, as well as 30 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, on our Financial Payment Card solutions, including patents on our instant issuance offering , and patents on our tamper - evident security packaging used by our customers that have Prepaid Debit Card offerings . We also hold exclusive production rights to certain products the Company has developed , as well as patented software solutions such as our MYCA&#8482; offering, which is integrated into the websites of over 300 card issuing banks and other customers. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Strong Management Team. We have built a strong management team led by Steven Montross, our CEO and President. Mr. Montross has led CPI for seven years and under his leadership we have completed three strategic acquisitions and we have experienced significant growth . Our management team has established a track record of recognizing and capitalizing on growth opportunities across the markets we serve. Management identified and drove our expansion into Prepaid Debit Card services during the early market adoption period of this card product. Similarly, our management team devised and executed on a strategy to develop our card services offering, which was accelerated by our acquisition of EFT Source. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

The key components of our strategy include: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Capitalize on U.S. EMV Conversion. The conversion to the EMV standard in the United States , which is expected to significantly &#160; increase the size of the Financial Payment Card market, is driven primarily by the increasing levels of card fraud in the United States, the Payment Card Brands&#8217; coordinated EMV conversion plan, including the liability shift which occurred on October 1, 2015, and the desire for a single global interoperable standard of card acceptance. The conversion of Financial Paym ent Cards in the United States from magnetic stripe technology to the EMV standard began in earnest in the second half of 2014 and is expected to continue over the next several years, with full adoption in the credit and bank debit card markets expected to be largely complete by the end of 2017 and increasing levels of adoption of Prepaid Debit Cards and &#8220; Private Label Credit Cards&#8221; (credit cards issued by an individual merchant for their exclusive use) beyond 2017 . In anticipation of the EMV conversion , and subsequently the expected further adoption of the more complex and higher priced d ual - i nterface EMV cards, we invested significantly in our network of facilities, technological infrastructure and human capital resources. We believe our comprehensive solutions offering and proven track record ideally positions us to be our customers&#8217; partner of choice to successfully complete the EMV conversion. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Capitalize on Growth in Prepaid Debit Market. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the expected growth of the Prepaid Debit Card market due to our market leading position, supported by our industry expertise , patents and comprehensive end - to - end card solutions. We have driven our leading market position through trust - based relationships with the largest global managers of Prepaid Debit Card programs, including InComm, Green Dot, Blackhawk Network , American Express and NetSpend . Additionally, we have further developed proprietary production techniques which provide us a cost advantage and additional flexibility to meet customer demands. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Capitalize on Growth in Instant Issuance Systems and Services Market. We acquired our instant card issuance system, Card@Once &#174; , through the acquisition of EFT Source in 2014 and have continued to drive significant growth in sales of our instant issuance systems and related services revenue. We plan to continue to grow our installed base of instant issuance systems in bank branches across the U.S. to increase our opportunity for continued recurring revenue streams from card personalization which is delivered through our software as a service offering. We believe the U.S. market is in the early stages of instant issuance adoption as, according to First Annapolis, only approximately 20% of U.S. bank branches are equipped with instant issuance solutions. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Cross - Sell Expanded Services Offering Across Customer Base. We believe our leading market position in Financial Payment C ard production in North America, combined with recent enhancements to our card services platform, including our acquisition of EFT Source, represents a significant opportunity to cross - sell services across our customer base by offering comprehensive end - to - end card solution s . W e believe that providing our existing customers this complete end - to - end solution represents a substantial revenue opportunity and means to further deepen our existing customer relationships. Through our strong track record in card services , we believe we have established a reputation as a trusted partner and advisor to our customers with the ability to securely manage significant amounts of sensitive and confidential customer data throughout our network. Due to the high costs of failure, such as a data breach, we expect that customers will continue to choose trusted vendors such as CPI that can provide high levels of security, service and certainty to manage these critical functions. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Continued Execution on Strategic Acquisitions. We have a strong track record of acquiring and integrating complementary businesses, completing six acquisitions since 2008, all of which have enhanced our market share, capabilities and capacity. We expect to continue to opportunistically execute strategic acquisitions that give us access to new markets and capabilities while providing a reasonable value proposition to our stockholders. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Products and Services 

&#160; 

EMV Financial Payment Cards (Contact and Dual - Interface) 

&#160; 

We pr oduce c ontact EMV cards, which feature a n &#160; integrated circuit that interfaces with an EMV payment terminal over a contact plate on the surface of the card when inserted into an EMV - enabled pay ment terminal. We also produce d ual - i nterface EMV cards, which feature both the contact EMV technology and a RFID antenna that utilizes near field communications (&#8220;NFC&#8221;) technology to allow transactions to also be processed on a contactless basis when the card is brought within the requisite proximity to a NFC enabled payment terminal. 

&#160; 

Non - EMV Financial Payme nt Cards and Retail Gift Cards 

&#160; 

We produce non - EMV cards that utilize magnetic stripes, contactless cards which utilize NFC technology and cards that include both magnetic stripes and NFC technology. In addition, we produce retail gift cards (which are not issued on the network of the Payment Card Brands) primarily in the U.K. and Canada. 

&#160; 

Card Data Personalization 

&#160; 

We provide data preparation and card data personalization solutions for debit, credit and Prepaid Debit Cards in EMV and non - EMV card formats. Our personalization services are technology - driven and provide a wide range of card customization options, using advanced processes to personalize (encode, program and emboss with data such as cardholder name and account number) and fulfill cards to individual cardholders. In addition, we provide EMV data script development services for our customers and in certain cases generate PIN numbers and mailers on their behalf. We offer patented card design software, known as MYCA&#8482;, which provides our customers and their cardholders the ability to design cards on the internet and customize cards with individualized digital images. We also provide consultation and card design services to further assist customers in card customization. Finally, we have the capabilities to provide Trusted Service Manager services, leveraging our existing data connectivity with processors and other customers to offer a trusted, high - security solution for facilitating mobile payments. 

&#160; 

Tamper - Eviden t Security Packaging Solutions 

&#160; 

We offer specialized and innovative tamper - evident security packaging products and services to customers with a Prepaid Debit Card offering that reduce fraud for Prepaid Debit Cards sold through the retail channel. The majority of the tamper - evident security packaging we produce is protected by our patents. In certain cases, we also manage the fulfillment of fully - completed Prepaid Debit Card packages to retail locations on behalf of our customers utilizing this solution. 

&#160; 

Instant Card Issuance Systems and Services 

&#160; 

We offer Card@Once &#174; , our proprietary and patented instant card issuance system and services, which provide our card issuing bank customers the ability to issue a completely personalized permanent debit or credit card within the bank branch to individual cardholders upon demand. Our instant issuance system is enabled by cloud - based software that securely transfers data from our servers to the card branch to encode either a magnetic stripe or an EMV card, and personalize the card on a desktop output terminal in a process which is certified by MasterCard and Visa. Our instant issuance system generates both system sales and recurring revenue from software as a service, card personalization and sales of cards and consumables. In addition, we provide instant issuance of debit cards to large financial institutions whereby we provide fully - personalized temporary debit cards which are issued to card holders upon opening a new account, and we manage the fulfillment and replenishment of these fully personalized cards directly to thousands of individual bank branches. 

&#160; 

Suppliers 

&#160; 

The most important component of our products is the EMV microchip, which we expect to become even more significant as EMV cards comprise an increasing percentage of the cards we ship. While we have developed constructive relationships with our suppliers and, in general, receive a high level of cooperation and support from them, the objective of our procurement strategy is not to depend on any single supplier. We obtain our components from multiple suppliers located in South Korea, France, the United States and Singapore, primarily on a purchase order basis. Our main suppliers 

&#160;

of EMV microchips are five leading manufacturers: KONA I Co. Ltd, Smart Packaging Solutions, NXP Semiconductors USA, Inc., Inside Secure and Multos International. Substantially all of our purchased EMV microchips for the year ended Dec ember 31, 2015 came from these five main suppliers. The other key components for our products are substrates (such as PVC), antennas and inlays which we also source from multiple suppliers. We continuously monitor supply chain risks and evaluate alternative suppliers based on numerous attributes including quality, performance, service, scalability, features, innovation and price. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

In the United States, we categorize our customers as follows: large issuers, prepaid debit issuers , program managers and small issuers. Our diverse customer base of over 4,000 direct and indirect customers includes many of the largest issuers of credit and debit cards in the United States and the five largest global managers of Prepaid Debit Card programs. Our top five customers represented approximately 31.5 % of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 201 5 . Our top five customers in 201 5 , who we have been serving for an average of greater than 10 years, were InComm, First Data Corporation, Barclays , Wells Fargo and PSCU . 

&#160; 

We generally enter into master purchase or service agreements that govern the general terms and conditions of our commercial relationships. We then enter into purchase order or other short - term arrangements &#160; that define the prices and the quantities of products to be delivered and services rendered. Usually, our contractual arrangements include neither exclusivity clauses nor commitments from our customers to order any given quantities of products on a medium or long - term basis. 

&#160; 

Production and Services 

&#160; 

Our production and services strategy has several key facets. We have a large network of integrated high - security facilities that we leverage to balance customer orders, expand the array of products and services available to our customers, provide consistent supply and execute short lead times. Our facilities and operating processes are designed to provide a differentiated level of service to each of our key customer sets. For example, we have the processes and capabilities to: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

execute high - volume, low - cost production runs that allow us to meet the competitive price points of large orders; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

execute lower - volume, highly personalized customized runs that allow us to meet the high - service and quick - turn needs of smaller orders; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

meet the specific needs of our Prepaid Debit Card customers. 

&#160; 

We operate approximately 498,000 square feet of facilities in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, where we focus on Financial Payment Card production and personalization services. See Part I, Item 2, &#8220; Propert ies&#8221; &#160; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the operations of each facility. 

&#160; 

We rely on secure ground and secure air freight to deliver products to our banking customers. Due to the high - security nature of the products we provide to our banking customers, product must be shipped to these customers via a secure method, such as armored vehicle. With respect to customers for whom we fulfill individual and personalized debit and credit cards, we utilize the U.S., Canadian and U.K. postal services to deliver these cards directly to individual cardholders. For other customers, we predominately deliver our products via regular ground and air freight. 

&#160; 

CPI has continued to expand its digital services to issuers focus ing on enabling payments for the growing e-commerce and mobile market place. Our digital services are primarily hosted solutions , which are designed to scale quickly to efficiently support a growing number of issuers and end users. CPI&#8217;s e-Services encompass a variety of secure hosted solutions, which enable improved customer service and efficiencies for our customers, including online card re-orders, order status, inventory management, EMV key management, and finished goods fulfillment. We also offer other innovative mobile services, such as CPI Mobile&#8482; , &#160; where we are able to provide solution s to digitize, encrypt and deliver payment credentials to mobile phones. The platform provides secure provisioning of tokenized credentials to phones , and is compliant with all the security mechanisms accepted by the payment networks (cloud-based Host Card 

&#160;

Emulation, Trusted Execution Environment, and hardware secure element). The production environment is PCI-DSS and EMVCo compliant for security, and can support NFC and secure barcode mobile payments. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We market our products and services to national and regional banks, independent community banks, credit unions, managers of prepaid programs, Group Service Providers and card processors. We have approximately 2 5 field - based sales representatives that give us a wide geographic reach across North America, Western Europe and Canada. Our sales representatives offer a complete end - to - end solution that incorporates the full spectrum of our products and services from concept to delivery. Our sales and marketing strategy focuses on strengthening our relationships with existing customers, providing a differentiated offer that includes cross - selling expanded services. We leverage the strength of our full - service offerings to attract new customers. Our marketing efforts focus on the needs of our specific types of customers. By tailoring our marketing strategy to different customer groups, we are able to provide relevant targeted solutions to meet their individual needs. We utilize an array of different marketing communications focused on thought leadership that include industry publications, editorial white papers, conferences and trade shows, print and digital advertisements and educational webinars designed to introduce our existing customers and new customers to innovations in the payments market. Through these efforts, we drive customer retention and satisfaction, and have been able to attract new customers. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The market for products and services in the payment card industry is highly competitive. Some of our competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do and have substantial flexibility in competing with us, including through the use of integrated product offerings and competitive pricing. Competitive factors for our business include product quality, security, service reliability, product line comprehensiveness and integration, timely introduction of new products and features and price. We believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories. 

&#160; 

Our products and services compete with other card manufacturers and card solutions providers. We believe our primary competitors are Oberthur Technologies S.A., Giesecke &#38; Devrient GmbH, Valid S.A. and Gemalto NV. Certain existing and potential financial institution customers also have the ability to personalize Financial Payment Cards in - house. In addition, we compete with customers that offer transaction processing products and services to financial institutions. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We own and control various intellectual property rights, such as patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and applications. We are also party to certain patent cross - license arrangements with industry participants and may, from time to time, enter into similar commercial agreements should we consider it necessary or beneficial for our business. 

&#160; 

We rely on a combination of statutory (copyright, trademark and trade secret) and contractual safeguards for intellectual property protection throughout the world. As of December 31 , 2015, we had 27 registered U.S. and foreign trademarks, 1 9 existing U.S. patents, as well as 30 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. Our patents have an average remaining maturity of 1 3 .5 years, and our trademarks will be due for renewal for additional ten or fifteen - year periods on an ongoing basis. 

&#160; 

Environmental Protection 

&#160; 

Our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental protection regulations, including those governing the emissions of pollutants into the air, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal, the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. We are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. We believe that we are in material compliance with environmental requirements and that environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, although resolution of any item in any particular year or quarter could be material to the results of operations or liquidity for that period. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Regulation 

&#160; 

Privacy and Data Security 

&#160; 

In the course of our business, we receive personally identifiable information of cardholders from our customers, either from a financial institution or through a card processor on behalf of a financial institution. Such information includes names, addresses, card account numbers and expiration dates. In some cases, we receive a cardholder&#8217;s PIN number. As a service provider to financial institutions in the United States, we comply with the privacy provisions of &#160; Gramm &#8209;Leach &#8209;Bliley Act (the &#8220;GLBA&#8221;) and its implementing regulations and, as applicable, with various other federal, state and foreign privacy statutes and regulations, and the PCI Security Standards Council&#8217;s Data Security Standards, each of which is subject to change at any time. We may only use and disclose the personal information we receive on behalf of our customers for the purposes for which it was provided to us and in a manner that is consistent with each financial institution&#8217;s and processor&#8217;s own data privacy and security obligations. 

&#160; 

In order to comply with our obligations under the GLBA, applicable state laws and our contractual agreements with our customers, we are required to safeguard and protect the privacy of personally identifiable information we receive. As part of their compliance with these requirements, each of our U.S. customers is expected to have a program in place for responding to unauthorized access to, or use of, consumer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to consumers. A majority of U.S. states have enacted security breach legislation, requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach, which could result in significant costs to us and significant damage to our reputation. 

&#160; 

The interpretation of pending and existing laws and regulations is evolving and, therefore, these laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently. It is possible that our current data protection policies and practices may be deemed inconsistent with new legal requirements or interpretations thereof, and breaches in the security of our systems and technology could result in a violation of these laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to requirements from the Payment Card Brands, which require us to meet certain security standards in order to achieve certification that allows us to produce and personalize Financial Payment Cards issued on their networks. These standards include extensive checklists with respect to the physical characteristics of our facilities, as well as our electronic treatment and storage of cardholder data. We believe that we have developed significant expertise in acquiring and maintaining these certifications, and have invested significant capital to obtain and retain these designations, which are regularly verified by both the Payment Card Brands and our customers. We believe the long, complex and costly certification process serves as a significant barrier to new entrants to our market. 

&#160; 

Financial Services 

&#160; 

We are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks, thrifts and credit unions. However, as a provider of products and services to these financial institutions, our operations may be examined by various state and federal regulatory authorities and representatives of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, which is a formal inter - agency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions. Also, state and federal regulations require our financial institution clients to include certain provisions in their contracts with service providers like us and to conduct ongoing monitoring and risk management for third party relationships. In addition, independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients&#8217; auditors.

In conducting certain of our card services, we are directly subject to various federal and state laws and regulations including those relating to the movement of money. In order to comply with our obligations under applicable laws, we are required, among other things, to comply with licensing and reporting requirements, to implement operating policies and procedures to comply with anti - money laundering laws, to protect the privacy and security of our clients &#8217; information and to undergo periodic audits and examinations.

In 2010, the Dodd - Frank Act was enacted. The Dodd - Frank Act introduced substantial reforms to the supervision and operation of the financial services industry, including introducing changes that: affect the oversight and supervision of financial institutions; provide for a new resolution procedure for large financial companies; introduce more stringent regulatory capital requirements; implement changes to corporate governance and executive compensation 

&#160;

practices; and require significant rule - making. The Dodd - Frank Act has generated numerous new regulations that have imposed compliance costs and, in some cases, limited revenue sources for us and our clients. The Dodd - Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( &#8220; CFPB &#8221; ) which is empowered to conduct rule - making and supervision related to, and enforcement of, federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has issued guidance that applies to &#8220;supervised service providers&#8221; which the CFPB has defined to include service providers, like us, to CFPB supervised banks and nonbanks. The CFPB has in the past and may in the future issue regulations that may require us to make compliance investments and/or limit our fees or other revenue sources. We do not currently anticipate a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition due to these regulations, but it is difficult to predict with certainty the extent to which the Dodd - Frank Act, the CFPB or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the businesses of our current and potential clients over the long term.
