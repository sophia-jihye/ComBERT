 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 26, 2009. The Company is engaged in the search mineral deposits or reserves which are not in the development or production stage. The Company intends to explore for oil and gas on its mining property. 

&#160; 

The Company does not have any revenues and has incurred losses since inception. Currently, the Company has no operations, has been issued a going concern opinion and relies upon the sale of our securities and loans from its sole officer and director to fund operations. 

&#160; 

Material Subsequent Events 

On April 5, 2016, we completed the purchase from EMS Find, Inc. (&#8220;EMS&#8221;) of Viva Entertainment Group, Inc. (&#8220;Viva Entertainment&#8221;), a Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of EMS, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement (&#8220;Stock Purchase Agreement&#8221;), and Viva Entertainment&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, Johnny Falcones, resigned from all positions at EMS and has been elected as our sole director and President and Chief Executive Officer to manage the development and marketing of Viva Entertainment&#8217;s over the top (IPTV/OTT) application for connected TV&#8217;s, desktop computers, tablets, and smart phones. 

&#160; 

This purchase represents a new business and industry which we operate in. Therefore, since the 8-K was recently filed with the SEC and we are now filing this 10-K among other SEC documents to be filed with the SEC subsequent thereto, we accordingly discuss the old and new operations herein as follows. References herein to oil and gas exploration are our older business operations and references to Viva Entertainment represent our new business operations. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company and EMS agreed to transfer control of Viva Entertainment to the Company through the purchase from the Seller by the Purchaser of all 800 outstanding shares of stock of Viva Entertainment to the Company in exchange for the issuance to EMS of a 10% promissory note in the principal amount of $100,000, due six months from the Closing (the &#8220;EMS Note&#8221;), which represents the purchase price paid by the Company for Viva Entertainment. In connection with the closing, Alexander Stanbury, our former President and Chief Executive Officer, transferred to Johnny Falcones 26,629,371 shares of restricted common stock of the Company from the shares of common stock owned by Mr. Stanbury in exchange for payment of $93,625 from the $135,000 of financing arranged with Essex Global Investment Corp. for the acquisition of the Company (the &#8220;Acquisition Financing Facility&#8221;). 

&#160; 

On April 6, 2016, the Company closed on the $135,000 Acquisition Financing Facility pursuant to a securities purchase agreement, dated April 6, 2016 (the &#34;Essex Securities Purchase Agreement&#34;), with Essex Global Investment Corp, a Nevada corporation (&#34;Essex&#34;), for the sale of a convertible promissory note (the &#34;Essex Note&#34;) in the principal amount of $145,000, with an original issue discount of $10,000. 

&#160; 

The Essex Note, which is due on March 30, 2017, bears interest at the rate of 10% per annum. All principal and accrued interest on the Note is convertible at any time into shares of the Company's common stock at the election of Essex at a conversion price for each share of Common Stock equal to 55% of the lowest reported trading price of the Company&#8217;s common stock for the twenty prior trading days including the day upon which the conversion notice is received by the Company or its transfer agent. The conversion price discount will be decreased to 45% if the Company experiences a DTC &#34;chill&#34; on its shares. If the Company is not current within 90 days from the date of the Note, the conversion discount will increase by 20%, so that the conversion price would be 35% of the trading price as calculated above. 

&#160; 

The Company has the right to prepay the Essex Note during the first six months following the date of issuance of the Essex Note with a premium of up to 135% of all amounts owed to Essex, including default interest, depending upon when the prepayment is effectuated. The Essex Note may not be redeemed after 180 days. 

&#160; 

The Essex Note contains default events which, if triggered and not timely cured, will result in default interest and penalties.

Strategy 

&#160; 

Please see &#8220;Subsequent Events&#8221; section below that describes a transaction that occurred in 2016. Therefore, this section will discuss our strategy regarding exploration and also discuss our newer strategy concerning our 2016 business acquisition. 

&#160; 

Black River Petroleum's strategy is to explore eastern America's frontier oil and gas resources. We have positioned ourselves in western Tennessee, a relatively unexplored region and is focusing on the prospective Trenton-Black River and Knox Formations. Black River Petroleum understands the need to balance the development of its assets with building value by keeping its overheads to a minimum. As such, we rely on industry professionals and consult with third party experts for the development and execution of a comprehensive exploration plan for the prospect. If the results of this exploration plan generate drill targets then we will aim to drill a well on the prospect in the near future. 

&#160; 

In 2016, we purchased a business and now we develop and market Viva Entertainment&#8217;s over the top (IPTV/OTT) application for connected TV&#8217;s, desktop computers, tablets, and smart phones. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We intend to engage in the acquisition, exploration, and development of Oil and Gas prospects. As such, we compete with other Oil and Gas exploration and development companies for financing and for the acquisition of new properties. We will also be competing with companies in obtaining exploration licenses. The Oil and Gas exploration companies with whom we compete may have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of exploration properties of merit, on exploration of their properties and on development of their properties. In addition, they may be able to afford more geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of such properties. This competition could result in competitors having properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration. This competition could adversely impact on our ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for us to develop our property. 

&#160; 

Government Regulations 

&#160; 

Our planned exploration activities in all operating areas are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing exploration, development, production, labor standards, occupational health and mine safety, control of toxic substances, and other matters involving environmental protection and taxation. It is possible that future changes in these laws or regulations could have a significant impact on our business, causing those activities to be economically reevaluated at that time. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We have not incurred any research and development expenditures over the past two fiscal years. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We currently have four employees consisting of Johnny Falcones, our officer and director, Edwin Batiz, our Urban Marketing President, Alberto Gomez, our Viva Entertainment President, and John Sepulveda, our Latin American President. Over the next 12 months, we intend to engage consultants to consult with us on specific corporate affairs or to perform specific tasks in connection with our Viva Entertainment operations. &#160; 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks.
