Business 

Overview 

TripAdvisor, Inc. owns and operates a portfolio of leading online travel brands. TripAdvisor, our flagship brand, is the world&#8217;s largest travel site. Our mission is to help people around the world plan and book the perfect trip. We accomplish this by, among other things, aggregating millions of travelers&#8217; reviews and opinions about destinations, accommodations, activities and attractions, and restaurants throughout the world so that our users have access to trusted advice wherever their trips take them. Our platform not only helps users plan their trips with our unique user-generated content, but also enables users to compare real-time pricing and availability so that they can book hotels, vacation rentals, flights, activities and attractions, and restaurants.

Our TripAdvisor-branded websites include tripadvisor.com in the United States and localized versions of the TripAdvisor website in 46 countries worldwide and are offered in 28 languages: English, Spanish, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Russian, Arabic, Greek, Korean, Polish, Norwegian, Turkish, Danish, Swedish, Dutch, Bahasa, Thai, Portuguese, Japanese, Italian, French, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Suomi, Hungarian, Czech, Slovak, Serbian, and German. Our TripAdvisor-branded websites, operated by our subsidiaries, reached 350 million average monthly unique visitors during the year ended December 31, 2015, according to our internal log files. Our websites feature 320 million reviews and opinions on 6.2 million places to stay, places to eat and things to do &#8211; including 995,000 hotels and accommodations and 770,000 vacation rentals, 3.8 million restaurants and 625,000 attractions around the world. In addition to user-generated content, our websites feature price comparison tools and links to partner websites, including travel advertisers, on which users can book their travel arrangements. Users may now also complete hotel bookings directly with our partners through tripadvisor.com and also through the TripAdvisor mobile application, where coverage is available.

In addition to the flagship TripAdvisor brand, we now manage and operate 23 other travel media brands, connected by the common goal of providing users the most comprehensive travel-planning and trip-taking resources in the travel industry.

&#160; Corporate History, Equity Ownership and Voting Control 

TripAdvisor was co-founded in February 2000 by Stephen Kaufer, our current President and Chief Executive Officer. TripAdvisor was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp, or IAC, in April 2004. In August 2005, IAC spun-off its portfolio of travel brands, 

&#160;

including TripAdvisor, into a separate newly-formed Delaware corporation called Expedia, Inc., or Expedia. On December 20, 2011 Expedia completed a spin-off of TripAdvisor into a separate publicly traded Delaware corporation. We refer to this second transaction as the &#8220;Spin-Off.&#8221; Following the Spin-Off, TripAdvisor began trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, or NASDAQ, as an independent public company on December 21, 2011 under the symbol &#8220;TRIP.&#8221; 

On December 11, 2012, Liberty Interactive Corporation, or Liberty, purchased an aggregate of 4,799,848 shares of common stock of TripAdvisor from Barry Diller, our former Chairman of the Board of Directors and Senior Executive, and certain of his affiliates. As a result, Liberty beneficially owned 18,159,752 shares of our common stock and 12,799,999 shares of our Class B common stock. 

On August 27, 2014, the entire beneficial ownership of our common stock and Class B common stock held by Liberty was acquired by Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc., or LTRIP. Simultaneously, Liberty, LTRIP&#8217;s former parent company, distributed, by means of a dividend, to the holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock, Liberty&#8217;s entire equity interest in LTRIP. We refer to this transaction as the Liberty Spin Off. As a result of the Liberty Spin-Off, effective August 27, 2014, LTRIP became a separate, publicly traded company holding 100% of Liberty&#8217;s interest in TripAdvisor. 

As a result of these transactions, as of December 31, 2015, LTRIP beneficially owned 18,159,752 shares of our common stock and 12,799,999 shares of our Class B common stock, which shares constitute 13.7% of the outstanding shares of common stock and 100% of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Assuming the conversion of all of LTRIP&#8217;s shares of Class B common stock into common stock, LTRIP would beneficially own 21.3% of the outstanding common stock. Because each share of Class B common stock is generally entitled to ten votes per share and each share of common stock is entitled to one vote per share, LTRIP may be deemed to beneficially own equity securities representing approximately 56.1% of our voting power.

Our Business Model 

Our platforms connect users wishing to plan and book the best travel experiences with providers of travel accommodations and travel services around the world. We derive the majority of our revenue from the sale of advertising, primarily through click-based advertising and, to a lesser extent, display-based advertising. The remainder of our revenue is generated through a combination of subscription and transaction-based offerings as well as content licensing. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Click-Based Advertising Revenue . Our largest source of revenue is click-based advertising, which includes links to our partners&#8217; booking sites and contextually-relevant branded and unbranded text links. Our click-based advertising partners are predominantly online travel agencies, or OTAs, and direct suppliers in the hotel, airline and cruise product categories. Click-based advertising is generally priced on a cost-per-click, or CPC, basis, with payments from advertisers based on the number of users who click on each type of link. CPC prices are determined in a bidding process that allows our partners to use our proprietary system to submit CPC bids to have their rates and availability listed on our site. When a partner submits a CPC bid they agree to pay the amount of that bid each time a user subsequently clicks on the URL link to the partner&#8217;s website. Bids are submitted periodically &#8211; sometimes as often as daily or weekly &#8211; on a property-by property basis and the size of the bid relative to other bids received determines the partner&#8217;s placement in all metasearch placements on our site with one or more offers shown, including hotel comparison search results and the property detail page. The system is automated and the size of the partner&#8217;s bid is the only factor impacting the partner&#8217;s placement on that page, except that individual partners may be sorted lower in the event that they have not provided price information or if they cease to have availability for the property. 

Click-based advertising revenue also includes revenue from our instant booking feature, which enables the merchant of record, generally an OTA or hotel partner, to pay a commission rate for a user that completes a reservation on TripAdvisor. Instant booking revenue is currently recognized under two different models : the transaction model and the consumption model. Our transaction model commission revenue is recorded at the time a traveler books a hotel reservation on our site with one of our transaction partners. Our transaction partners are liable for commission payment to us upon booking and the partner assumes the cancelation risk. When a traveler makes a hotel reservation on our site with one of our consumption partners, revenue is not recorded until the travelers&#8217; stay. Our consumption partners are liable for commission payment upon the completion of stay by the traveler. OTA and hotel partner placement and comparative hotel prices available to the traveler in the booking process under both models are determined in a bidding process in our proprietary system, based on a number of variables including commission rates, depending on the specific hotel selected.

For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we earned $956 million, or 64%, $870 million, or 70% and $696 million, or 74%, respectively, in revenue from click-based advertising.

&#160;

&#183; 

Display-Based Advertising Revenue . Advertising partners can promote their brands in a contextually-relevant manner through a variety of display-based advertising placements on our websites. While our display-based advertising clients are predominately direct suppliers in the hotel, airline and cruise categories as well as OTAs, we also accept display 

&#160;

&#160;

advertising from destination marketing organizations, casinos, resorts and attractions, as well as advertisers from non-travel categories. Display-based advertising is sold predominantly on a cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, basis. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , we earned $159 million, o r 11%, $140 million, or 11%, and $119 million, or 13%, respectively, in revenue from display-based advertising. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Subscription-Based, Transaction-Based and Other Revenue . Business Listings is a subscription-based advertising product offered to hotels, B&#38;Bs and other specialty lodging properties. This advertising product is sold for a flat fee and allows subscribers to list, for a contracted period of time, a website URL, email address and phone number on our TripAdvisor-branded websites, as well as to post special offers for travelers. In addition, we earn revenue from making hotel room nights available for booking on our transaction-based sites, including Jetsetter and Tingo for which we are the merchant of record, making rental listings available through our vacation rentals business, selling destination activities primarily through Viator, and providing access to online restaurant reservations primarily through Lafourchette, or thefork.com; as well as other revenue including content licensing with third party sites. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we earned $377 million, or 25%, $236 million, or 19%, and $130 million, or 14%, respectively, in revenue from subscription-based, transaction-based and other revenue. 

Our Industry 

We operate in the global travel industry, focusing exclusively on online travel activity and the online advertising market.

According to Phocuswright, global travel spending is expected to be greater than $1.3 trillion in 2016. Recent historical trends show that, each year, an increasing percentage of global travel spending has been conducted online through supplier websites and online travel agencies. We believe that this trend will continue as online penetration continues to grow, as more consumers gain broadband access to the Internet, as smartphone, tablets and other mobile computing devices continue to proliferate, and as travel activity increases along with an expanding middle class in certain developing countries like China and India. 

We believe that the Internet will continue to become even more integral to the travel-planning process due to increasing worldwide online penetration, particularly given the capabilities that the Internet provides travelers, including the ability to refine searches, compare destinations, view real-time pricing, complete bookings, and access information while in-destination. 

More advertisers continue to shift their spending from offline to online channels, mirroring the trend in consumer media consumption generally. Given the size of the travel market, we believe that travel providers and travel related advertisers are, and will continue to be, motivated to devote significant resources to advertise their travel products and services. In addition, as more and more travel transactions are conducted online generally, we believe that an increasing amount of travel advertising spending will migrate from traditional offline advertising channels to online advertising opportunities. 

Our Key Strengths 

TripAdvisor-branded sites are comprehensive online resources for user-generated content on destinations, lodging, attractions and restaurants that help travelers plan and book the perfect trip. To help our users plan their trip, we currently feature 320 million reviews and opinions on accommodations, attractions, and restaurants, including more than 50 million candid photos, and helpful content ranging from hotel room tips to travel guides. We provide real-time pricing and availability search functionality that compares hundreds of partner websites so that users can find and book the best prices. We also enable users to book activities and attractions and restaurant reservations on our site. Our tools and travel content are available to users around the world in 28 different languages as well as on web-based and mobile applications on mobile devices and on desktops.

In order to achieve our goal, we leverage our key assets&#8212;a robust travel community, rich user-generated content, continuous technological innovation and global reach&#8212;as follows: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Robust Travel Community . We believe that we have the largest breadth of content in our markets and that, because of this breadth, travelers gravitate to our websites to research and plan their trips. By providing an interactive forum to share their experiences, our large and highly engaged community of travelers is a valuable resource. To facilitate planning, we enable consumers to research pricing and availability from third-party travel booking sites. To encourage better travel experiences for consumers and to create a feedback loop between the hospitality industry and individual travelers, we allow hospitality management representatives to respond to reviews of their properties on our website. After completing their trip, consumers can return to our websites to write reviews to give back to the community that helped them plan their trip. Through this cycle, more content is generated, which drives community, traffic, loyalty and higher search engine rankings, all of which lead to further content creation. We believe that the volume of reviews generated on our websites and the robust feedback loop created on our websites provides us with a significant advantage over our competitors. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Rich User-Generated Content. We believe that the best travel content comes fro m the wisdom and insight of a robust community of travelers. We leverage user-generated content to power travel planning by allowing members to create reviews and share opinions on hundreds of thousands of accommodations, destinations, attractions and rest aurants. As evidenced by the growth of our business, this type of travel planning has been embraced by travelers. To promote an enthusiastic reviewer community that continues to provide valuable content and promotes our brand, we have launched several prog rams to recognize reviewer contributions, including site badges, helpful vote recognition, and other features, all of which highlight the current and helpful reviews and opinions available throughout the TripAdvisor community. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Technology and Innovation . Product innovation and speed to market are our two most important priorities in order to create an increasingly rich user experience. We have weekly engineering releases that contain new products and features for our websites and mobile apps. Some recent examples of this product innovation include: Just For You, which delivers users a more personalized hotel shopping experience; instant booking, a feature that enables users to complete a hotel reservation while remaining on the TripAdvisor website; hotel metasearch, which enables users to see real-time availability and compare prices from hundreds of partner websites, without requiring the user to visit another website; and TripConnect, which enables independent hoteliers to compete for leads on TripAdvisor. Our ongoing commitment to innovation also extends to content syndication and review collection partnerships, as we leverage our technology and content for the benefit of other websites. In addition, we utilize manual and electronic fraud detection in order to maintain the quality and authenticity of user reviews. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Global Reach . We are a global company, both through the reach of our portfolio of branded websites and through our in-market staffing in 24 countries. As of December 31, 2015, we had 1,530 employees based outside of the United States, representing 51% of our employee population. As of December 31, 2015, we had branded websites in 46 countries outside the United States in 28 languages. We have nearly 990 million review translations, and are committed to continuing to improve the in-country user experience and the local content coverage for all of our points-of-sale. We believe that the universally-relevant content and community of our core TripAdvisor platform and our other brands uniquely position us to appeal to travelers throughout the world. 

Our Strategy 

We leverage significant investments in technology, operations, brand-building, and relationships with advertisers and other partners to expand our business and enhance our global competitive position. These investments have enabled us to, among other things, aggregate a large base of consumer reviews, in a variety of languages, across our global platform of websites. We continue to focus on the following areas to grow our business:

&#160;

&#183; 

Continuing Technology Innovation. We believe our ability to innovate and to provide additional functionality to our websites and apps across all devices will enable us to continue to deliver an industry-leading user experience. Our innovation culture supports bringing product enhancements to market at speed. In doing so, we believe that we can continue to, among other things, grow content, usage, loyalty and engagement, as well as to enhance our competitive positioning. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Enhancing Community-Driven Platform. We grow brand awareness and member acquisition on social media channels, including Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms. We believe our social integration and personalization initiatives help to drive usage of, engagement with, and content contributed to, our products. Users can share their reviews and ratings with their friends through Facebook Connect and also can publish their TripAdvisor content to their Facebook timelines. Additionally, our Just For You personalization feature gives users personalized recommendations based on friends&#8217; reviews and ratings as well as information collected about user preferences in selecting hotels. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Improving the User Experience. We strive to improve the travel discovery and booking experience as well as help users discover and book places to eat and things to do while they are on the trip. For example, in 2013 we introduced hotel price comparison, or hotel metasearch, which enables users to find real-time availability and the lowest hotel room prices from hundreds of partner websites, without requiring the user to visit another website. Starting in 2014 and throughout 2015, we also rolled out our hotel instant booking feature, for hotels across our U.S. and U.K. platforms to all users on all devices. In addition to price comparison and booking capabilities, we offer user reviews, photos, room tips, management questions and answers, maps, and filtering to enable users to find the best accommodation, attraction or restaurant for them. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Investing in Traffic Growth. We believe that our travel products are excellent tools to help all travelers plan and book the perfect trip. We seek to amplify our global brand and products through various online and offline marketing channels to increase the number of users who navigate to our site either directly, also known as domain direct traffic, or from other marketing channels. We leverage a number of offline advertising channels including: permanent branding campaigns such as TripAdvisor-branded travel awards, certificates, stickers and badges and television advertising. We also leverage a number of online advertising channels including: customer relationship management email campaigns, or CRM; social 

&#160;

&#160;

networks; organic search through search engine optimization, or SEO; paid search thro ugh search engine marketing, or SEM; and referrals from partners whose sites contain links to TripAdvisor content, badges or widgets. At approximately 18% of global online travel unique visitors, according to comScore Media Metrix, we believe that we have an opportunity to continue growing unique visitors to our websites. In order to achieve this objective, we intend to invest in the aforementioned channels, as well as any new channels that we may identify in the future. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Allowing Hotel Shoppers to Book Directly on Our Websites. We believe that allowing users to book directly online without leaving our TripAdvisor-branded websites will result in a better user experience as well as, ultimately, additional revenue to the Company. Instant booking is a feature that enables users to make a hotel reservation directly with a hotel or OTA partner while remaining on the TripAdvisor website. We have been gradually rolling this feature out in the U.S. since June 2014 and in 2015, accelerated the rollout of instant booking for hotels across our U.S. and U.K. platforms to all users on all devices. We also plan to continue rolling out this feature to additional international markets in 2016. Our business success depends in large part on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with our partners in the travel industry. These partners power the instant booking feature on our website and, we believe, also benefit from this feature, through increased reservations and more direct relationships with travelers. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Enhancing Our Mobile Offerings . We believe investing in and rapidly innovating and improving the TripAdvisor user experience on mobile devices is necessary to maintain and grow our business. We create new, user-friendly and differentiated mobile offerings and develop ways to efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platforms. We have invested in developing and improving our native applications and have made significant progress creating mobile offerings which have received strong user feedback and have been downloaded 290 million times. We see an opportunity to increase monetization of mobile devices, especially as we increase the percentage of revenue that comes from transaction-based products. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Enhancing International Offerings . We are focused on strengthening our broad global footprint as we believe that penetrating international markets represents a long-term opportunity for us. We continue to improve localization and grow our user base in Europe, Asia and South America, especially in emerging markets, such as Brazil, Russia and China. In addition, we currently have a lead product offering in the Chinese market&#8212;re-branded Mao Tu Ying (or TripAdvisor China) &#8212; headquartered in Beijing. We continue to invest in the Chinese market, despite operating at a loss, and will continue to enhance our product offerings to international travelers. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expansion into Adjacent Categories . We intend to continue to grow our business and expand our product and service offerings that either complement our existing core hotel segment or provide additional resources, products and/or services that will improve the user experience for hotel shoppers. In addition, we continue to make investments, in adjacent categories in order to leverage and monetize the significant percentage of our users who are not hotel shoppers, or who visit TripAdvisor sites without navigating to pages that contain a listing of hotels in a city or a specific hotel&#8217;s page. Two recent examples include our acquisitions of Lafourchette or thefork.com, the leading online and mobile reservation platform for restaurants in France, Spain and Switzerland, with a network of restaurant partners in Europe and Australia; and Viator, the leading online resource for researching and booking destination activities around the world. 

Our Commercial Relationships 

We have a number of commercial relationships that are important to the success of our business. Although these relationships are memorialized in some form of agreement, many of these agreements are for a limited term or are terminable at will or on short notice. As a result, we work hard to ensure the mutual success of these relationships. 

We have advertising relationships with the vast majority of the leading OTAs as well as a variety of other travel suppliers pursuant to which these companies purchase traveler leads from us, generally on a CPC basis. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our two most significant advertising partners, Expedia and Priceline (and their subsidiaries), each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue and combined accounted for 46% of our total revenue. 

&#160;

Our instant booking feature enables hotel shoppers to book directly with a third-party partner, without leaving our website. To facilitate this, we have partnered with seven of the top ten major hotel chains, including Accor, Best Western International, Carlson Rezidor, Choice Hotels, Hyatt Hotels, Marriott International and Wyndham Worldwide. We also partnered with Priceline, whereby some of Priceline's online travel brands will participate in our instant booking platform, beginning with its Booking.com brand. As a result, users are able to book more than 450,000 hotels, powered by our partners, without leaving the TripAdvisor site or mobile experience. 

We have a content licensing program utilized by over 1,300 partners around the world, including hotel chains, online travel agents, tourist boards, airlines and media sites. TripAdvisor also distributes its content through self-service HTML widgets, which are used on the websites of hotels, restaurants, attractions and destination marketing organizations. These products, which are available at 

&#160;

no cost in the TripAdvisor Management Center, allow businesses and destinations to promote themselves by displaying their TripAdv isor ratings, reviews and awards. TripAdvisor widgets are presently found on more than 200,000 unique domains around the globe. Both free and licensed TripAdvisor content reaches over 900 million people per month. Partners benefit from our user-generated content, such as reviews, ratings and photos. In addition, we power review collection for a growing number of partners, such as Accor Hotels, Wyndham Hotel Group, Best Western and Easytobook.com, enabling them to proactively collect reviews from their own customers post-stay in their own branded environment. We have also developed partnerships with mobile carriers and device manufacturers. 

Marketing and Promotions 

We have established widely-used and recognized brands through our marketing efforts. We continue to aggressively promote our brands, particularly our flagship brand TripAdvisor. Our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our brands, promote consumer engagement and contributions, drive qualified clicks to our metasearch and instant booking partners and strategically position our brands in the market. Our long-term success depends on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of consumers flowing through our brand in a cost-effective manner, to engage customers in both the planning and booking phase, and to attract consumers who will share their own content from their trips. We reach consumers across mobile and desktop devices through our online marketing acquisition programs, and offline through our offline brand campaigns. We also utilize our CRM channels by sending relevant and engaging traveler communications to our members via email. We have a robust global public relations program that yields placements on a constant basis in major print and online publications. We continue to look for new ways to build brand awareness and expand new channels, which may include traditional media and social media channels including Facebook and Twitter to deepen customer engagement. We syndicate our content so that other sites can feature TripAdvisor branding and content. Lastly, marketing and product development initiatives are closely tied. We are constantly creating helpful features and functionality so that our users can discover more relevant travel planning reviews, advice and booking content that they want to talk about and share with their friends. 

Operations and Technology 

We have assembled a team of highly skilled software engineers, computer scientists, data scientists, network engineers, and systems engineers whose expertise spans a broad range of technical areas, including a wide variety of open source operating systems, databases, languages, analytics, networking, scalable web architecture, operations, and warehousing technologies. We make significant investments in product and feature development, data management, personalization technologies, scalable infrastructures, networking, data warehousing, and search engine technologies. The TripAdvisor-branded websites are powered primarily using Java programming language. 

Our systems infrastructure, web and database servers for TripAdvisor-branded websites are housed at two geographically separate facilities and have multiple communication links as well as continuous monitoring and engineering support. Each facility is fully self-sufficient and operational with its own hardware, networking, software, and content, and is structured in an active/passive, fully redundant configuration. Substantially all of our software components, data, and content are replicated in multiple datacenters and development centers, as well as being backed up at offsite locations. Our systems are monitored and protected though multiple layers of security. Several of our individual subsidiaries and businesses, including Viator, have their own data infrastructure and technology teams. 

Widespread adoption of mobile devices such as iPhone, Android-enabled smart phones and tablets such as the iPad, coupled with the improved web browsing functionality and development of thousands of useful apps available on these devices, is driving substantial traffic and commerce activity to mobile platforms. We have seen tremendous growth in the adoption of mobile platforms, as have our advertising partners. Advertising opportunities may be more limited on mobile devices given their small screen sizes. Further, given the size and technical limitations of tablets and smartphones, mobile consumers may not be willing to download multiple apps from multiple travel service providers and instead prefer to use one or a limited number of apps for their mobile travel activity. As a result, the consumer experience with mobile apps (as well as brand recognition and loyalty) is becoming increasingly important and we make significant investments in this area. 

We believe that mobile bookings are necessary to maintain and grow our business as consumers increasingly turn to mobile devices and mobile applications. As a result, we have made significant progress creating mobile offerings, which have received strong reviews, solid download trends and are driving an increasing share of our business. 

Our Competition 

We compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets. We face competition for content, users, advertisers, online travel search and price comparison services (or hotel metasearch) and online reservations. We also face competition from large companies that also offer comprehensive on-line resources for destinations, lodging, attractions and restaurants. 

&#160;

Our primary competitors include large online portals, social networking sites and search engines, su ch as Google (including Google + Local), Facebook (including Graph Search), Yahoo! (including Yahoo! Travel) and Baidu. We also face competition from OTAs (such as Expedia and Priceline and their respective subsidiaries), as well as wholesalers, tour opera tors and traditional offline travel agencies. We also compete with a wide range of other companies, including Airbnb, Inc., Alibaba, Ctrip.com International, Ltd., HolidayCheck AG, HomeAway, Inc. (a subsidiary of Expedia), Yelp, Inc. and OpenTable, Inc. (a subsidiary of Priceline). 

In the competition to attract users, we rely on our ability to acquire traffic through offline brand recognition and brand-direct efforts such as television, email and online search, whether unpaid or paid. Unpaid search is sometimes referred to as SEO, which is the practice of developing websites with relevant and current content that rank well in &#8220;organic,&#8221; or unpaid, search engine results. SEO can be affected by a number of factors including competitive site content, changes to our website architecture and page designs, changes to search engine ranking algorithms, or changes to display ordering in search engine results such as preferred placement for internal products offered by search engines. SEM is a form of Internet marketing that involves the promotion of websites by increasing their visibility in search engine results pages through the use of paid placement, contextual advertising, and paid inclusion. SEM is a competitive marketplace with competitors continually updating their traffic acquisition strategies and economic models across a large number of keywords and markets. 

We compete for advertisers with large, established search engines with significantly greater resources than we have, such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo!, as well as online media companies and ad networks, and offline advertising sources, such as television and print media. These competitors have large client bases and significantly greater resources than we have and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic are creating inroads into online travel. Competition from these parties could cause us to lose advertising customers or shares of advertising expenditures. If Google, or any other leading search engines refer significant traffic to these or other travel services that they develop in the future, or otherwise favor supplier websites or other travel service websites over other online travel sites, including us, it would likely become more difficult and expensive for us to generate traffic to our websites and therefore maintain or grow our market share. 

We also compete for online travel search and price comparison services (or hotel metasearch), with other such companies, including Expedia (through its ownership of Trivago), Priceline (through its ownership of Kayak) and HotelsCombined. 

&#160;

With respect to our restaurant, attractions and vacation and short-term rental businesses, we face competition from a variety of companies, including: 

&#160;

&#183; 

online restaurant reservation services, such as OpenTable (a subsidiary of Priceline), Yelp&#8217;s SeatMe and Amazon&#8217;s Table8; 

&#160;

&#183; 

online attraction reservation services, such as GetYourGuide and Expedia&#8217;s Destination Services; 

&#160;

&#183; 

online accommodation search and/or reservation services focused on vacation and short-term rental properties, such as HomeAway (a subsidiary of Expedia) and Airbnb, Inc. 

&#160;

Certain of the companies we do business with are also our competitors. The consolidation of our competitors and partners, including Expedia (through its ownership of Trivago, Orbitz, Travelocity, and HomeAway) and Priceline (through its ownership of Kayak and OpenTable), coupled with evolving business models throughout the industry, results in a highly dynamic competitive environment. As the market evolves for online travel content and the technology supporting it, including platforms such as smartphone and tablet computing devices, we anticipate that the existing competitive landscape will change and new competitors may emerge. 

Intellectual Property 

Our intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, proprietary technology and trade secrets, is an important component of our business. We rely on our intellectual property rights in our content, proprietary technology, software code, ratings indexes, databases of reviews and forum content, images, videos, graphics and brands. We have acquired some of our intellectual property rights through licenses and content agreements with third parties. These licenses and agreements may place restrictions on the use of our intellectual property. 

We protect our intellectual property by relying on our terms of use, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, as well as on international, national, state and common law rights. In addition, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. We protect our brands by pursuing the trademark registration of our core brands, such as TripAdvisor and the Owl Logo, maintaining our trademark portfolio, securing contractual trademark rights protection when appropriate, and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate. We also register copyrights and domain names as deemed appropriate. Additionally, we protect our trademarks, domain names and copyrights with the use of intellectual property licenses and an enforcement program. 

&#160;

We have considered, and will continue to consider, the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions, as circumstances may warrant. However, many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may no t create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us. 

Government Regulation 

We are subject to a number of United States federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These may involve user privacy, libel, rights of publicity, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to United States federal and state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of user data. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. United States federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations is often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving industry in which we operate. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the United States Congress, various state legislative bodies, and foreign governments concerning data protection which could affect us. 

In addition, we provide advertising data and information and conduct marketing activities that are subject to United States federal and state consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices, domestically and internationally. The United States and European Union have begun to adopt legislation that regulates certain aspects of the Internet, including online editorial and user-generated content, user privacy, behavioral targeting and online advertising, taxation, and liability for third-party activities. 

United States federal, state and foreign governments have considered from time to time alternative legislative and regulatory proposals that would increase regulation on Internet advertising. It is impossible to accurately predict whether new taxes or regulations will be imposed on our services, and whether or how we might be affected. Increased regulation of the Internet could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operational results. 

We are subject to laws that require protection of user privacy and user data. In our processing of reservations, we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable data in the United States, Europe and Asia. This data is increasingly subject to laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, including the Commission of the European Union through its Data Protection Directive and variations and implementations of that directive in the member states of the European Union. Such government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.

Our Reportable Segments 

We have two reportable segments: Hotel and Other. Our Other segment consists of three operating segments: our Attractions, Restaurants and Vacation Rentals businesses. Our operating segments are determined based on how our chief operating decision maker manages our business, regularly assesses information and evaluates performance for operating decision-making purposes, including allocation of resources. The chief operating decision maker for the Company is our Chief Executive Officer. 

Hotel Segment 

Our Hotel segment accounted for 85% of our Company&#8217;s consolidated revenue in 2015 and includes revenue generated from services related to hotels, including click-based and display-based advertising revenue from making hotel room nights available for price comparison and booking, including our instant booking feature, as well as subscription-based hotel products such as Business Listings, transaction-based hotel products such as Jetsetter and Tingo, and other revenue related to hotels. Our Hotel segment also includes advertising revenue from making airline reservations and cruise reservations available for price comparison and booking. 

The Hotel segment&#8217;s financial performance is principally dependent on our ability to grow click-based advertising revenue. This revenue stream is highly dependent upon growth in our hotel shoppers, how effectively we convert hotel shoppers into revenue, and the price we get paid per hotel shopper, all of which equates to revenue per hotel shopper. We use the term &#8220;hotel shoppers&#8221; to refer to visitors who view either a listing of hotels in a city or a specific hotel page. 

A significant percentage of our annual unique users are not hotel shoppers and visit TripAdvisor sites without navigating to pages that contain a listing of hotels in a city or a specific hotel&#8217;s page. Revenue generated from these users is reflected in our Other segment below.

&#160;

Other Segment 

Our Other segment accounted for 15% of our consolidated revenue in 2015 and consists of the following businesses: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Attractions. We provide, primarily through Viator, information and services for researching and booking destination activities around the world. Viator works with local operators to provide travelers with access to tours and activities in popular destinations worldwide, earning a commission for such service. In addition to its consumer-direct business, Viator also provides local experiences to affiliate partners, including some of the world&#8217;s top airlines, hotels and travel agencies. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Restaurants. We have several websites that provide online and mobile reservation services that connect restaurants with diners. These websites are primarily focused currently on the European and Australian markets, primarily through Lafourchette or thefork.com (including www.lafourchette.com, www.eltenedor.com, www.iens.nl, www.besttables.com, and www.dimmi.com.au). thefork.com is an online restaurant booking platform with a network of restaurant partners primarily across Europe and Australia. Lafourchette also offers management software solutions helping restaurants to maximize business by providing a flexible online booking, discount and data tool. We generate revenue primarily by charging a fee for each restaurant guest seated through the online reservation systems. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Vacation Rentals. We offer individual property owners and property managers the ability to list their properties available for rental and connect with travelers using a subscription-based fee structure or a free-to-list, commission per booking based option. Our vacation rental inventory currently includes full home rentals, condos, villas, beach rentals, cabins, cottages, and many other accommodation types. These properties are listed across a number of platforms, including TripAdvisor Vacation Rentals, U.S.-based FlipKey and Vacation Home Rentals, and our European-based Holiday Lettings and Niumba businesses. 

Substantially all of the revenue reported in our Other segment is subscription-based, transaction and other revenue.

Financial Information about Reportable Segments and Geographic Information 

For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 our two most significant advertising partners, Expedia and Priceline, each accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue and combined accounted for 46%, 46% and 47% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. This concentration of revenue is recorded in our Hotel segment for these reporting periods. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, Expedia accounted for 11% and 15%, respectively, of our total accounts receivable.

Financial information related to our two reportable segments and geographic information required herein is contained in &#8220;Note 16 &#160;&#8212; Segment and Geographic Information ,&#8221; in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 3,008 employees. Of these employees, approximately 49% were based in the United States. We believe we have good relationships with our employees, including relationships with employees represented by international works councils or other similar organizations. 

Seasonality 

The global travel market is large and traveler expenditures tend to follow a seasonal pattern. As such, expenditures by travel advertisers to market to potential travelers, and, therefore, our financial performance, tend to be seasonal as well. As a result, our third quarter tends to be our seasonal high, as it is a key period for travel research and trip-taking and our seasonal low generally occurs in the first and/or fourth quarter. Significant shifts in our business mix or adverse economic conditions could influence the typical trend of our seasonality in the future.

Except as explicitly noted, the information on our website, as well as the websites of our various brands and businesses, is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or in any other filings with, or in any information furnished or submitted to, the SEC.
