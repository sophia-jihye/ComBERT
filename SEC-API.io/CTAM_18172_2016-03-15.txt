 ITEM 1 &#8212; &#32; Business 

In this annual report on Form 10-K, &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; refer to A. M. Castle &#38; Co., a Maryland corporation, and its subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements, except as otherwise indicated or as the context otherwise requires. 

Business and Markets 

Company Overview 

The Company is a specialty metals ( 83% &#32;of net sales in 2015) and plastics ( 17% &#32;of net sales in 2015) distribution company serving customers on a global basis. The Company provides a broad range of products and value-added processing and supply chain services to a wide array of customers. The Company's metals customers are principally within the producer durable equipment, oil and gas, aerospace, heavy industrial equipment, industrial goods and construction equipment sectors of the global economy, and its plastics customers are primarily in the retail, marine and automotive sectors. Particular focus is placed on the aerospace, power generation, mining, heavy industrial equipment, manufacturing and oil and gas for metals and automotive, marine, office furniture and fixtures, safety products, life sciences applications, transportation and general manufacturing industries for plastics. 

The Company&#8217;s corporate headquarters is located in Oak Brook, Illinois. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company operates out of 24 &#32;metals service centers located throughout North America ( 19 ), Europe ( 3 ) and Asia ( 2 ) and 17 &#32;plastics service centers located in the United States. The Company&#8217;s service centers hold inventory and process and distribute products to both local and export markets. 

Industry and Markets 

Service centers act as supply chain intermediaries between primary producers, which deal in bulk quantities in order to achieve economies of scale, and end-users in a variety of industries that require specialized products in significantly smaller quantities and forms. Service centers also manage the differences in lead times that exist in the supply chain. While original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEM&#8221;) and other customers often demand delivery within hours, the lead time required by primary producers can be as long as several months. Service centers provide value to customers by aggregating purchasing, providing warehousing and distribution services to meet specific customer needs including demanding delivery times and precise metal specifications, and by providing value-added metals processing services. 

The principal markets served by the Company are highly competitive. Competition is based on service, quality, processing capabilities, inventory availability, timely delivery, ability to provide supply chain solutions and price. The Company competes in a highly fragmented industry. Competition in the various markets in which the Company participates comes from a large number of value-added metals processors and service centers on a regional and local basis, some of which have greater financial resources and some of which have more established brand names in the local, regional and global markets served by the Company. 

The Company also competes to a lesser extent with primary metals producers who typically sell to larger customers requiring shipments of large volumes of metal. 

In order to capture scale efficiencies and remain competitive, many primary metal producers are consolidating their operations and focusing on their core production activities. These producers have increasingly outsourced metals distribution, inventory management and value-added metals processing services to metals service centers. This process of outsourcing allows them to work with a relatively small number of intermediaries rather than many end customers. As a result, metals service centers, including the Company, are now providing a range of services for their customers, including metal purchasing, processing and supply chain solutions. 

Procurement 

The Company purchases metals and plastics from many producers. Material is purchased in large lots and stocked at its service centers until sold, usually in smaller quantities and typically with some value-added processing services performed. The Company&#8217;s ability to provide quick delivery of a wide variety of specialty metals and plastic products, along with its processing capabilities and supply chain management solutions, allows customers to lower their own inventory investment by reducing their need to order the large quantities required by producers and their need to perform additional material processing services. Some of the Company&#8217;s purchases are covered by long-term contracts and commitments, which generally have corresponding customer sales agreements. 

Orders are primarily filled with materials shipped from Company stock. The materials required to fill the balance of sales are obtained from other sources, such as purchases from other distributors or direct mill shipments to customers. Deliveries are made principally by the Company&#8217;s fleet contracted through third party logistics providers. Common carrier delivery is used in areas not serviced directly by the Company&#8217;s fleet. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had 1,515 &#32;full-time employees. Of these full-time employees, 225 &#32;were represented by the United Steelworkers of America under collective bargaining agreements. 

Business Segments 

The Company distributes and performs processing on both metals and plastics. Although the distribution processes are similar, the customer markets, supplier bases and types of products are different. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision-maker, reviews and manages these two businesses separately. As such, these businesses are considered reportable segments and are reported accordingly in the Company&#8217;s various public filings. Neither of the Company&#8217;s reportable segments has any unusual working capital requirements. 

In the last three years, the percentages of total sales of the two segments were as follows:

Metals Segment 

In its Metals segment, the Company&#8217;s marketing strategy focuses on distributing highly engineered specialty grades and alloys of metals as well as providing specialized processing services designed to meet very precise specifications. Core products include alloy, aluminum, nickel, stainless steel, carbon and titanium. Inventories of these products assume many forms such as plate, sheet, extrusions, round bar, hexagon bar, square and flat bar, tubing and coil. Depending on the size of the facility and the nature of the markets it serves, the Company's service centers are equipped as needed with bar saws, plate saws, oxygen and plasma arc flame cutting machinery, trepanning machinery, boring machinery, honing equipment, water-jet cutting equipment, stress relieving and annealing furnaces, surface grinding equipment, CNC machinery and sheet shearing equipment. This segment also performs various specialized 

fabrications for its customers through pre-qualified subcontractors that thermally process, turn, polish, cut-to-length and straighten alloy and carbon bar. 

The Company&#8217;s customer base is well diversified and therefore, the Company does not have dependence upon any single customer, or a few customers. Our customer base includes many Fortune 500 companies as well as thousands of medium and smaller sized firms. 

The Company&#8217;s broad network of locations provides same or next-day delivery to most of the segment&#8217;s markets, and two-day delivery to substantially all of the remaining markets. 

Plastics Segment 

The Company&#8217;s Plastics segment consists exclusively of a wholly-owned subsidiary that operates as Total Plastics, Inc. (&#8220;TPI&#8221;), headquartered in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Plastics segment stocks and distributes a wide variety of plastics in forms that include plate, rod, tube, clear sheet, tape, gaskets and fittings. Processing activities within this segment include cut-to-length, cut-to-shape, bending and forming according to customer specifications. 

The Plastics segment&#8217;s diverse customer base consists of companies in the retail (point-of-purchase), automotive, marine, office furniture and fixtures, safety products, life sciences applications, and general manufacturing industries. TPI has locations throughout the upper northeast and midwest regions of the U.S. and one facility in Florida from which it services a wide variety of users of industrial plastics. 

On March 11, 2016, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with an unrelated third-party for the sale of TPI. TPI represents the entirety of the Company's Plastics segment and therefore, the Company will only have one reporting segment, the Metals segment, going forward. As of December 31, 2015, TPI did not meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale and accordingly its results are presented with continuing operations. The terms of the sale are discussed in Note 15 - Subsequent Events &#32;to the consolidated financial statements. 

For further information on the Company's segment results, see Part II Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 13 - Segment Reporting &#32;within the notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. 

Joint Venture 

The Company holds a 50% &#32;joint venture interest in Kreher Steel Company, LLC (&#8220;Kreher&#8221;), a national distributor and processor of carbon and alloy steel bar products, headquartered in Melrose Park, Illinois. The Company&#8217;s equity in the earnings (losses) of this joint venture is reported separately in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of operations. Kreher's stand-alone financial statements are included in this filing.
