 Item 1. Business. Our History and Corporate Structure 

China Health Industries Holdings, Inc. (&#147;China Health US&#148;) was incorporated in the State of Arizona on July 11, 1996 and was the successor of the business known as Arizona Mist, Inc. which began in 1989. On May 9, 2005, it entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement and Share Exchange (effecting a reverse merger) with Edmonds 6, Inc. (&#147;Edmonds 6&#148;), a Delaware corporation, and changed its name to Universal Fog, Inc. Pursuant to this agreement, Universal Fog, Inc. (which has been in continuous operation since 1996) became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Edmonds 6.

China Health Industries Holdings Limited (&#147;China Health HK&#148;) was incorporated on July 20, 2007 in Hong Kong under the Companies Ordinance as a limited liability company. China Health HK was formed for the purpose of seeking and consummating a merger or acquisition with a business entity organized as a private corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship as defined by FASB ACS Topic 915 (&#147;Development Stage Entities&#148;).

Harbin Humankind Biology Technology Co., Limited (&#147;Humankind&#148;) was incorporated in Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province, the People&#146;s Republic of China (the &#147;PRC&#148;) on December 14, 2003, as a limited liability company under the Company Law of the PRC. Humankind is engaged in the manufacturing and sale of health products.

On August 20, 2007, the sole shareholder of China Health HK entered into a share purchase agreement (the &#147;Share Purchase Agreement&#148;) with the owners of Humankind. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, China Health HK purchased 100% of the ownership in Humankind for a cash consideration of $60,408 (the &#147;Share Purchase&#148;). Subsequent to the completion of the Share Purchase, Humankind became a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Health HK. The Share Purchase was accounted for as a &#147;reverse merger&#148; since the owner of Humankind owned a majority of the outstanding shares of China Health HK&#146;s common stock immediately following the execution of the Share Purchase Agreement, it was deemed to be the acquirer in the reverse merger. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that have been reflected in the financial statements for periods prior to the Share Purchase are those of Humankind and have been recorded at the historical cost basis. After completion of the Share Purchase, China Health HK&#146;s consolidated financial statements include the assets and liabilities of both China Health HK and Humankind, the historical operations of Humankind, and the operations of China Health HK and its subsidiaries from the closing date of the Share Purchase.

On October 14, 2008, Humankind set up a 99% owned subsidiary, Harbin Huimeijia Medicine Company (&#147;Huimeijia&#148;), with its primary business being manufacturing and distributing medicine. Mr. Xin Sun, the Company&#146;s majority owner, owns 1% of Huimeijia. Huimeijia is consolidated in the consolidated financial statements of China Health HK.

On December 31, 2008, China Health HK entered into a reverse merger with Universal Fog, Inc., a U.S. publicly traded shell company (the &#147;Transaction&#148;). China Health HK is the acquirer in the Transaction, and the Transaction has been treated as a recapitalization of China Health US. After the Transaction and a 20:1 reverse stock split, Mr. Xin Sun owned 61,203,088 shares of common stock, representing 98.3% of the 62,234,737 total outstanding shares of common stock of China Health US. On April 7, 2009, Mr. Sun transferred 28,200,000 shares of common stock to 296 individuals, leaving him with 33,003,088 shares of common stock of China Health US, or approximately 53.03% of the total outstanding shares of common stock. Universal Fog, Inc. changed its name to China Health Industries Holdings, Inc. on February 19, 2009.

On November 22, 2013, Humankind completed the acquisition of Heilongjiang Huimeijia Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (&#147;HLJ Huimeijia&#148;) for a total purchase price of $16,339,869 (RMB100,000,000). HLJ Huimeijia was founded on October 30, 2003, and is engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of tincture, ointments, rubber paste (including hormones), topical solution, suppositories, liniment (including traditional Chinese medicine extractions), enemas and oral liquids. HLJ Huimeijia&#146;s predecessor is Heilongjiang Xue Du Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., which has established its brand name in the market through its supply of high quality medical products. HLJ Huimeijia is categorized as a &#147;high and new technology&#148; enterprise by the Science Technology Department in Heilongjiang Province. HLJ Huimeijia has 21 products which have been approved by, and have received approval numbers issued by, the China Food and Drug Administration (&#147;CFDA&#148;). In addition, HLJ Huimeijia is the holder of one patent for utility models, five patents for external design and three trademarks in China, including the Chinese brand name of &#147;Xue Du&#148; which has an established reputation among customers in northeastern China.

China Health US, China Health HK, Humankind, Huimeijia and HLJ Huimeijia are collectively referred herein to as the &#147;Company.&#148;

Our corporate structure as of June 30, 2016 was as below:

Business Overview 

Humankind was incorporated in the PRC on December 14, 2003, and completed its Good Manufacturing Practice (&#147;GMP&#148;) certificate on April 24, 2007, which will last until February 14, 2019 and is expected to extend after that. It is in the business of the manufacture and sale of health products.

Huimeijia was incorporated in the PRC on October 14, 2008. Huimeijia received its GMP certificate on July 23, 2009, which expired as of July 22, 2014. On December 24, 2014, Humankind entered into a stock transfer agreement (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) with Xiuzheng Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. a company incorporated under the laws of the People&#146;s Republic of China and located in Jilin province (&#147;Xiuzheng Pharmacy&#148; or the &#147;Buyer&#148;), Mr. Xin Sun, the CEO of the Company, and Huimeijia, pursuant to which, Humankind and Mr. Xin Sun (the &#147;Equity Holders&#148;), shall sell their respective equity interests in Huimeijia to Xiuzheng Pharmacy. The transfer of the 100% equity interests of Huimeijia to the Buyer was for a total cash consideration of RMB 8,000,000 (approximately $1,306,186) to the Equity Holders. 

On February 9, 2015, the four parties entered into a supplementary agreement (the &#147;Supplementary Agreement&#148;) to modify the terms of the Agreement, pursuant to which, the Equity Holders and Huimeijia (collectively the &#147;Assets Transferors&#148;) shall only sell the 19 drug approval numbers (including the tablet, capsule, powder, mixture, oral liquid, syrup and oral solution under the 19 approval numbers; licenses including the original copies of Business License, Organization Code Certificate, Tax Registration Certificate, Drug Production Permit and GMP Certificate, and other documents and original copies related to the production and operation of the 19 drugs) (the &#147;Assets&#148;) to Xiuzheng Pharmacy. The Equity Holders will retain the equity interests in Huimeijia, but will have the equity interests pledged to Xiuzheng Pharmacy until the Assets are transferred, at which time all the cash consideration shall be paid by the Buyer. The total cash consideration remains to be the same as under the Agreement, i.e., RMB 8,000,000 (approximately $1,306,186) to the Assets Transferors. 

In the event that the Assets are failed to be transferred to the Buyer due to the fault of the Assets Transferors, the paid consideration shall be returned to the Buyer with interests accrued. If the failure of the transfer of the Assets is a result of the government policy changes or force majeure, the paid cash consideration shall be returned to the Buyer but without any interests. As of June 30, 2016, the transfer of the Assets had not been completed because the assets transfer crossed different provinces which resulted in a complicated interaction among the local administrations of Heilongjiang Province, where Huimeijia is located and Jilin Province, where the transferee is located. The Company is striving to accelerate the process of the transfer.

HLJ Huimeijia was founded on October 30, 2003, its latest GMP certificate was effective from November 12, 2009 to December 31, 2015. HLJ Huimeijia has applied a new certificate of GMP, which is expected to be obtained in April 2017. HLJ Huimeijia engages in the manufacture and distribution of tincture, ointments, rubber paste (including hormones), topical solution, suppositories, liniment (including traditional Chinese medicine extractions), enemas and oral liquids. Its predecessor is Heilongjiang Xue Du Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., which had established brand name in the market through its supply of high-quality drug products. HLJ Huimeijia is a &#147;high and new technology&#148; enterprise that provides the most comprehensive types of topical medical products in Heilongjiang Province, a northeastern province of China.

Our business is conducted through our PRC subsidiaries, Humankind and HLJ Huimeijia. Our products are primarily sold through sales agents. We plan to develop chain-stores to sell our products and to eventually sell our products online.

Our Development Strategy 

We will focus on combining our products with traditional Chinese medicine, the creation of new products, and developing our B2C e-business and chain-stores. We plan to implement health management projects in our future chain-stores throughout China and establish a database of our clients&#146; health data obtained from our B2C e-business and call center.

We plan to establish a one-stop shop for our customer&#146;s health needs. From conducting a genetic profile of our customer to determine his/her susceptibility to certain types of diseases and then customizing health supplements and organic/green food to meet his/her needs, we plan to cater to our customer&#146;s needs at all levels. With the distribution network we hope to establish through our chain stores and B2C e-businesses, we plan to eventually branch into the sale and distribution of beauty products and medical appliances.

The Future 

Within the next ten years, our goals are to:

&#160; 1. Increase product coverage in target markets; achieve 20%-30% coverage 

Our target market is the health industry market. Presently, we believe that our product coverage is approximately 0.2% . We plan to open distribution stores in different provinces of China to expand our coverage. We also plan to sell our products through B2C websites to our customers.

&#160; 2. Enter into the medicine, health product, health industry top 500 companies in the PRC 

Currently, we are not ranked in the top 500 medicine, health product and health industry companies in the PRC. We believe that if our projected increase in revenue is achieved, we will achieve our goal of becoming one of the top 500 medicine, health product, health industry companies in China.

&#160; 3. Form a diversified management group 

Currently, our management group comprises people graduated from the most prestigious universities in the PRC, such as Peking University and Renmin University of China. We plan to further diversify management group by hiring talent both in the PRC and abroad.

&#160; 4. Enter into the international market and create an internationally famous brand 

Currently, our products are sold under the brand names &#147;Qunle&#148;, &#147;Kindlink&#148;, &#147;Huimeijia&#148; and &#147;Dr. Xiao&#148; in the PRC. Our goal is eventually to expand our sales abroad to countries such as the United States of America, Russia, and Eastern Europe and South-east Asian countries.

Our Business Plan 

The plans designed to meet our manufacturing, marketing and profit targets include:

Good Manufacturing Practice or &#147;GMP&#148; is a term that is recognized worldwide for the control and management of manufacturing and quality control testing of foods and pharmaceutical products. An important part of GMP is documentation of every aspect of the process, activities, and operations involved with drug and medical device manufacture. Additionally, GMP requires that all manufacturing and testing equipment has been qualified as suitable for use, and that all operational methodologies and procedures (such as manufacturing, cleaning, and analytical testing) utilized in the drug manufacturing process have been validated (according to predetermined specifications), to demonstrate that they can perform their purported function(s).

The Market for Healthcare and Beauty Products 

The health product industry is one of the mainstream industries in the PRC, since it has a high level of recognition and importance. Recently there have been new policies for health products, which control quality, manufacturing, manufacturing environments and techniques. With the PRC&#146;s large and aging population there will be a steady demand for healthcare products. It is predicted that the healthcare and beauty industry will flourish over the next 50 years.

The Healthcare Product Market in the PRC 

With thousands years of history in health culture and traditional Chinese medicine, PRC currently utilizes advanced technique and production capacity to initiate a new round of health care trend, from drugs and medicines to traditional health food and nutritional supplements, and from medical devices to health management and advices. The trend demonstrates huge potential in PRC&#146;s health products market.

Compared with the U.S. and Australia, the Chinese domestic industry of healthcare products is emerging. The scale of this industry in 2014 is $14 billion. The per capita consumption level is $56 in the U.S., $41.6 in Australia, and $11.4 in China. According to the forecast conducted by Bain and Company, the scale of the industry in China will increase by 8% each year in the following four years, and reach $19.6 billion in 2018. 

According to a report issued by BCG, the global management consulting firm based in Boston, titled &#147;From Insight to Action: Capturing a Share of China&#146;s Consumer Health Market&#148;, Chinese consumers are increasingly health conscious and China&#146;s growing health and wellness market is expected to reach nearly $70 billion by 2020.

In the PRC, a Good Manufacturing Practice Certification (&#147;GMP Certification&#148;) is required for companies that produce medical drugs and health supplements. It is also required to market our medical drugs and health supplements. According to the Administrative Rules of Drug Manufacturing and Certification issued by the CFDA of the PRC on September 7, 2005, the CFDA is responsible for the review and issuance of GMP Certification. To obtain a GMP Certification, a company shall submit its application; the CFDA will then conduct a technical review of the application materials; if such company passes the technical review, the CFDA will inspect the manufacturing site. The CFDA also conducts follow-up inspections on the manufacturing site. After the issuance of the GMP Certification, the CFDA may inspect the manufacturing site from time to time. The GMP Certifications of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Humankind, HLJ Huimeijia and Huimeijia, are valid through February 14, 2019, December 31, 2015, and July 22, 2014, respectively. For the GMP Certificate of HLJ Huimeijia&#146;s, the Company has applied a new certificate, which is expected to be issued in April 2017. Once GMP Certification is obtained, we would be able to manufacture and market our products without further governmental approval. For the GMP Certificate of Huimeijia&#146;s, the Company did not renew the GMP Certificate due to its pending assets sale to Xiuzheng Pharmacy.
