Business

Overview

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing a pipeline of differentiated therapeutics for orphan indications that we intend to commercialize on our own, and for larger market indications that we intend to partner with global pharmaceutical companies. We have built a core enabling discovery platform for the discovery of validated drug targets by studying rare human diseases with extreme traits, including diseases caused by mutations in ion channels, known as channelopathies. We have an integrated platform that includes in-house capabilities for human genetics, small molecule drug discovery, as well as preclinical and clinical development.

Our pharmaceutical partners include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., or Teva (through its subsidiary, Ivax International GmbH), Genentech, Inc., or Genentech, and Merck &#38; Co., Inc., or Merck (through its affiliate, Essex Chemie AG). Our pharmaceutical collaborations have generated in aggregate over $155.0 million in non-equity funding to date with the potential to provide us with over $1.0 billion in future milestone payments, as well as royalties and co-promotion income on product sales.

Our business was founded on our proprietary discovery platform, which we refer to as Extreme Genetics. Extreme Genetics involves the study of families where individuals exhibit inherited severe traits, or phenotypes. By identifying and characterizing single-gene defects responsible for these phenotypes, we gain insights into human disease biology to better select targets for therapeutic intervention. We believe that our Extreme Genetics discovery platform enhances the likelihood of discovering a drug target that has a major effect in humans. From these discoveries, we can gain an improved understanding of how a drug that modulates the target might act when given to a human.

Our Extreme Genetics discovery platform has yielded the first approved gene therapy product in the European Union, or the EU, and a broad proprietary development pipeline and multiple pharmaceutical partnerships, which include:

&#160;

&#183; 

Glybera, developed by our licensee uniQure Biopharma B.V., or uniQure, the first, and currently the only, gene therapy product approved in the EU for the treatment of the orphan disorder lipoprotein lipase deficiency, or LPLD. The first patient treated with Glybera as a commercially-available gene therapy was announced by uniQure in November 2015 and enabled by its commercialization partner in the EU, Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A., or Chiesi, which has sole control over commercialization in the EU; 

&#160;

&#183; 

TV-45070 (formerly XEN402), a product candidate being developed in collaboration with Teva for the treatment of pain. Teva is currently conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with post- herpetic neuralgia, or PHN, with results expected in the second half of 2016. TV-45070 is a topically applied small-molecule inhibitor of the sodium channel Nav1.7 and other sodium channels, including those that are expressed in the pain-sensing peripheral nervous system ; 

&#160;

&#183; 

GDC-0276 and GDC-0310, which are both oral, selective Nav1.7 small-molecule inhibitors being developed in collaboration with Genentech for the potential treatment of pain. Phase 1 clinical trials for GDC-0276 and GDC-0310 are ongoing, and pending a full assessment of the results, Genentech intends to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in 2016. Xenon and Genentech also have an active research collaboration focused on other orally selective small molecule inhibitors of Nav1.7; 

&#160;

&#183; 

XEN801, a stearoyl Co-A desaturase-1, or SCD1, inhibitor being developed for the treatment of acne. SCD1 is an enzyme involved in lipid synthesis that is expressed in sebaceous glands in the skin. We have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial for XEN801 and initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in February 2016 in patients with moderate to severe facial acne. We anticipate topline results in the fourth quarter of 2016; and 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

additional proprietary preclinical programs, including a Nav1.6 sodium channel inhibitor for the treatment of rare childhood epilepsy disorders, such as Dravet Syndrome, or DS, an orphan disease of severe childhood epilepsy. We expect to identify a development candidate in 2016 and file an investigational new drug, or IND, application for our Nav1.6 i nhibitor in the first half of 2017. &#160;

Our Strategy 

Our goal is to build a self-sustaining, fully-integrated and profitable company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative therapeutics, including novel selective ion channel inhibitors, by applying our expertise in the genetics of rare human diseases.

Since our inception, we believe we have operated in a capital-efficient manner to build our capabilities and assets through phased growth, expansion and value creation. Prior to our November 2014 initial public offering and concurrent private placement, our last equity financing was in 2006. From 2006 to November 2014, we funded our operations and expanded our platform, product pipeline and infrastructure through a strategy which combined the deployment of our own resources and the establishment of broadly enabling and well-structured pharmaceutical partnerships with industry leaders.

Our strategy includes:

&#160;

&#183; 

Expanding our pipeline and advancing multiple discovery and development programs, focusing on orphan and niche disease market opportunities that we can independently develop and commercialize ourselves. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Selectively establishing additional partnerships enabling us to access large commercial indications while leveraging the benefits of those collaborations to expand our internal capabilities. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Further leveraging our discovery platform and insights into disease biology to identify novel targets and develop next-generation products. 

Our Extreme Genetics Discovery Platform

Despite advances in medical sciences and the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s understanding of diseases, research and development productivity in the industry has declined over the years. We believe that a contributor to this problem is the industry&#8217;s reliance on drug discovery approaches that are sometimes based on targets that do not necessarily have a major biological effect in humans. Consequently, it is fairly common for a pharmaceutical company to invest substantial time, resources and funds into drug development only to realize in late-stage clinical trials that a product candidate may be directed to a target that is either not biologically relevant to the disease or that may have diverse functions or effects in humans, thereby leading to poor efficacy or safety.

Our Extreme Genetics discovery platform enables us to identify drug targets that may be more biologically relevant in humans. Our platform is built on the foundation of identifying and studying rare individuals and families with severe phenotypes to discover single-gene defects that have major biological effects in humans. By studying these individuals and families with severe phenotypes, we can obtain critical insights into the genes underlying these diseases and their related biology to develop promising product candidates. We therefore are able to initiate our drug discovery efforts with the advantage of having a greater understanding of the role of the drug target in human disease.

The selection of suitable families with rare phenotypes is integral to our successful identification of single-gene defects. Such families are rare and dispersed throughout the world, which makes accessing and studying such families a challenge. We have developed internal clinical genetics expertise allowing us to identify and access rare families. To date, we have established a global network that has included more than 30 clinical collaborations in multiple countries. We collect DNA and detailed clinical information from the selected families to which we then apply our in-house genetics, molecular biology and bioinformatics capabilities to identify the single-gene defect. Using these genetic insights, we apply our in-house, small-molecule expertise as well as access other therapeutic modalities, with the goal of developing novel medicines.

&#160;

Our reli ance on our Extreme Genetics discovery platform for target selection differs from other target selection methods commonly employed in the industry, such as in vitro cell biology and screening, tissue and differential expression studies, in vitro and animal based pharmacology and the use of animal models, such as gene knock-outs or animal transgenics. Some companies, however, do use human genetics to varying degrees to assist with target identification, such as approaches where larger populations of patients and controls are studied to define associations where a disease and single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, in certain genes are linked. While SNP associations allow the identifications of genes that show an association with a disease or may increase ri sk of disease, such associations differ from our Extreme Genetics discovery platform since they do not discover genes that are determinant or causal of a disease. By studying families with rare diseases where individuals present with severe phenotypes, we seek to isolate the genetic cause of such diseases. We then use this causal information as our primary methodology underlying our target discovery and selection. 

The key components of our Extreme Genetics discovery platform include:

&#160;

&#183; 

clinical geneticists and genetic counselors with a deep understanding of clinical phenotypes. These experts identify the rare genetic disorders with severe phenotypes that we study; 

&#160;

&#183; 

years of experience and extensive know-how in successfully navigating through regulations in multiple countries in order to obtain the approvals necessary to collect and use detailed clinical information and DNA samples from individuals and families with severe phenotypes; 

&#160;

&#183; 

internal capabilities in genome sequencing, molecular biology and bioinformatics to enable identification of single-gene defects and validation of these as potential drug targets; 

&#160;

&#183; 

expertise in small-molecule drug discovery to design promising product candidates that effectively modulate the identified drug targets. Our drug discovery capabilities include medicinal and synthetic chemistry, assay development and in vitro and in vivo pharmacology; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

an established global network that has included more than 30 clinical collaborators in multiple countries, and which has provided us with access to rare individuals and families with severe phenotypes dispersed throughout the world. 

In addition, Xenon has built upon our global network by developing a new direct-to-patient web-based recruitment approach for identifying patients with rare or extreme phenotypes. By leveraging social media tools and allowing potential participants to directly access research studies online, we have successfully broadened the recruitment of participants for several of our research studies. 

Focus on Human Channelopathies

A significant focus of our Extreme Genetics discovery platform has been human channelopathies, enabling us to develop strong capabilities in small molecule ion channel drug discovery. Our ion channel discovery capability is founded upon our understanding of the genetics of channelopathies combined with our proprietary biology and medicinal chemistry assets and know-how. We identified new binding sites on ion channels which, in turn, led to the discovery of highly-selective voltage-gated ion channel inhibitors which may have safety and efficacy advantages over non-selective inhibitors.

While the pharmaceutical industry has shown significant interest in channelopathies, a general inability to target ion channels selectively with a pharmaceutical agent has been a limitation to the development of effective therapeutics. We believe we have developed a core competence in developing highly-selective small-molecule ion channel inhibitors, and we believe we can use this know-how to develop a pipeline of novel ion channel inhibitors for diseases in areas of high unmet medical need.

For example, we discovered that deficiency of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 is present in the rare human disease called congenital indifference to pain, or CIP. Individuals with CIP are unable to feel pain. This relationship indicated that Nav1.7 may be a key mechanism for the development of novel analgesics. We are pursuing this mechanism in separate partnerships with Teva and with Genentech.

Similarly, with our collaborators from McGill University, we identified the genetic link between rare human epilepsies and mutations in the Nav1.1 sodium channel. These genetic epilepsy discoveries helped to define our therapeutic selective ion channel strategy for DS and other rare childhood epilepsies. We believe that our Extreme Genetics discovery platform provides the opportunity to validate additional ion channel targets for both prevalent and orphan indications.

&#160;

Our Pipeline 

Our pipeline is summarized in the following figure, which shows both our partnered programs and our own proprietary product candidates:

&#160;

Our Partnered Programs

Glybera (alipogene tiparvovec): A Gene Therapy for the Orphan Disease LPLD

Glybera is a gene therapy product approved in the EU in October 2012 for the treatment of a subset of patients with the orphan lipid disorder lipoprotein lipase deficiency, or LPLD. Specifically, it is intended to treat LPLD in patients with severe or multiple pancreatitis attacks, despite dietary fat restrictions. LPLD is a severe metabolic disease of inadequate lipid metabolism, resulting in pancreatitis and in some cases, death. In collaboration with the University of British Columbia, or UBC, we demonstrated that humans with a variant of the lipoprotein lipase, or LPL, gene called LPL S447X resulted in increased LPL enzyme activity leading to reduced triglyceride levels. Under our sublicense and research agreement with uniQure, we collaborated with uniQure and UBC on preclinical activities, and thereafter uniQure developed a LPL gene therapy product, Glybera, which contains the LPL S447X variant. We believe that the introduction of the therapeutic LPL S447X gene through administration of Glybera provides a clinical benefit for LPLD patients.

Glybera is the first product whose active ingredient was derived from our platform to receive commercial approval and is the first gene therapy product to be approved in the EU. The goal of Glybera therapy is to treat LPLD in order to achieve sustained improvement of clearance of triglyceride-rich lipid particles known as chylomicrons, and to significantly reduce the risk of pancreatitis attacks in patients suffering from multiple recurrent pancreatitis and abdominal pain events. 

&#160;

About LPLD 

Familial LPLD is a rare autosomal-recessive disorder of lipoprotein metabolism. LPLD is characterized by severe hypertriglyceridemia caused by the absence of LPL activity, and, as a consequence, certain triglyceride-rich lipoproteins accumulate in the plasma. The population frequency of LPLD in the U.S. has been reported to be approximately one in a million individuals by the National Library of Medicine.

LPLD typically manifests early in childhood, with repeated episodes of abdominal pain and acute pancreatitis that can be life-threatening. There is currently no approved gene therapy for LPLD in the U.S. The current management of LPLD consists of strict adherence to an extremely low-fat diet, but compliance with such a diet is challenging. Lipid-lowering drugs are generally not effective for treating LPLD. We believe effective therapeutic strategies are therefore needed for this condition.

About LPL S447X 

Together with our collaborators at UBC and using our Extreme Genetics discovery platform, we demonstrated that the LPL S447X variant resulted in reduced triglyceride levels in humans, as this single-gene defect results in elevated LPL enzyme activity, and we further demonstrated that LPL S447X in an adenovirus gene therapy could treat hypertriglyceridemia in animal models of LPLD.

Clinical Development of Glybera

In a scientific publication, a single dose of Glybera was well-tolerated with no material safety concerns and was demonstrated to reduce the incidence of acute pancreatitis and abdominal pain events over the two-year study period.

Commercialization of Glybera

In 2012, Glybera was approved in the EU for the orphan disorder LPLD to treat patients with severe or multiple pancreatitis attacks. In July 2013, uniQure announced that it had entered into a partnership with Chiesi for the commercialization of Glybera in the EU and more than a dozen other countries including Brazil, China, Mexico and Russia. Glybera has received both fast-track and orphan drug designations for the treatment of LPLD in both the EU and the U.S. The first patient treated with Glybera as a commercially-available gene therapy in the EU was announced by uniQure in November 2015. Although commercial sales of Glybera have now commenced, we do not expect to receive significant revenue in the near-term from these sales. uniQure also disclosed in November 2015 that it will not pursue U.S. regulatory approval of Glybera in order to maintain its focus on three core therapeutic areas. uniQure has announced that it will not provide additional guidance regarding commercialization progress for Glybera. For a more detailed description of the terms of our agreement with uniQure for Glybera, see &#8220;&#8212;Strategic Alliances&#8221; below.

TV-45070: A Small Molecule for the Treatment of Pain

TV-45070 (formerly XEN402) is a small-molecule inhibitor of the sodium channel Nav1.7 and other sodium channels, including those that are expressed in the pain-sensing peripheral nervous system. TV-45070 has potential application in neuropathic pain mediated by damage, dysfunction, or injury of nerves. TV-45070 is partnered with Teva. Using a topical ointment formulation of TV-45070, Teva is currently conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with PHN with results expected in the second half of 2016. Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with Teva, Teva is obligated to complete one additional Phase 2 or later stage clinical trial.

We selected Nav1.7 as a drug target for pain after we discovered that the Nav1.7 protein is deficient in the rare human disease, CIP, where humans suffering from CIP are unable to feel pain. We have observed promising evidence of activity for TV-45070 in four Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trials, including two trials in the orphan disease erythromelalgia, or EM, one trial in PHN and one trial in dental pain, a form of nociceptive pain. In December 2012, we entered into a collaborative development and license agreement with Teva through its subsidiary Ivax, pursuant to which we granted Teva an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize TV-45070. For a more detailed description of the terms of our agreement with Teva, see &#8220;&#8212;Strategic Alliances&#8221; below. Prior to our entry into a collaborative development and license agreement with Teva, we submitted INDs to the FDA for oral TV-45070 for the indication of dental pain (July 2009) and topical TV-45070 for the indication of acute and chronic pain, including neuropathic and inflammatory pain (July 2010). Teva submitted an IND to the FDA for topical TV-45070 for the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis, or OA (November 2013).

&#160;

Discovery of TV-45070 and Mechanism of Action 

Using our Extreme Genetics discovery platform, we discovered Nav1.7 by studying families with the rare disorder CIP. Patients with CIP are unable to feel pain for painful events including fractures, childbirth, osteomyelitis, severe burns, ulcers, wounds and tooth abscesses. Based on this severe phenotype of absence of pain in humans with CIP, we predicted that the single-gene defect causing CIP could define an important novel human drug target for treating pain. We showed that defects in the CIP gene result in deficiency of the sodium channel Nav1.7.

Nav1.7 is highly expressed in peripheral nerves and transmits pain signals. We believe that inhibition of Nav1.7 may reduce these pain signals. TV-45070 was designed to be a non-selective small-molecule inhibitor of Nav1.7 such that it also can inhibit additional sodium channels, including those that we believe play a role in pain signaling. We believe this mixed sodium channel inhibition may enhance the potential efficacy of TV-45070 in chronic pain. TV-45070 is currently being developed as a topical product as its chemical properties are favorable for topical administration, including high local skin and underlying tissue concentrations with low plasma levels. With these properties, we believe we can target the site of generation of peripherally-based pain without unnecessarily exposing other tissues to significant levels of this compound. This is especially true for the central nervous system where we might expect to observe side-effects when multiple sodium channels are inhibited, such as sleepiness, nausea, and dizziness. We have demonstrated efficacy with this compound in multiple animal models for pain including both nociceptive and neuropathic pain models. The broad sodium channel inhibition of TV-45070 is in contrast to our selective inhibitors licensed to Genentech, which are selective for Nav1.7 and are being developed as oral formulations.

Clinical Development of TV-45070

We are collaborating with Teva on the development of topical TV-45070. Topical and oral formulations of TV-45070 have been studied in Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers, four Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trials, a Phase 2b clinical trial in OA of the knee, and an ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial in PHN, with data expected in the second half of 2016. Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with Teva, they are obligated to complete one additional Phase 2 or later stage clinical trial.

TV-45070 Phase 1 Clinical Trials

In a topical Phase 1 study, 20 healthy volunteers were dosed once daily for 21 days with 4% and 8% ointment, placebo, a positive control and a 0.9% saline negative control. Topical TV-45070 was generally well tolerated with no clinically meaningful difference observed between cumulative skin irritation scores for 4% and 8% ointment, placebo and the negative saline control. The positive control as expected did show greater skin irritation; there were no serious adverse events, or SAEs, or deaths in this study. All adverse events were moderate or mild in severity with the majority of adverse events related to local skin reactions from the occlusive tape dressings. The most frequently reported adverse events which were not local skin reactions were headache, dizziness, fatigue, and oropharyngeal pain. Importantly the average plasma concentrations of TV-45070 were low and, as would be expected, central nervous system side effects were of low incidence.

To better understand the systemic side effect profile of TV-45070, the drug was also dosed in Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose studies using a simple liquid-filled capsule for oral administration. The single-ascending dose, or SAD, study was carried out in 38 healthy volunteers dosed up to 800 mg. The multi-ascending dose, or MAD, study was performed in 32 healthy volunteers who were dosed up to 400 mg twice daily for 5.5 days. The maximal tolerated dose, or MTD, for SAD study was 500 mg and dose-limiting toxicity included dizziness and drowsiness observed for the 800 mg single dose, which we believe indicates inhibition of central nervous system expressed sodium channels. The MTD in the MAD study was not achieved and occasional short-lived adverse events of mild to moderate dizziness and drowsiness were reported by some subjects for the 400 mg twice daily dose.

TV-45070 Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept Clinical Trials

Based on the potential broad utility of TV-45070, prior to our collaboration with Teva, we conducted four Phase 2 proof-of-concept trials to explore the potential of TV-45070 as a treatment for both nociceptive and neuropathic pain, as well as providing evidence that TV-45070 can block the pain signaling mediated by Nav1.7. These trials included: (1) an oral Phase 2 clinical trial in third molar tooth extraction; (2) an oral Phase 2 clinical trial in the orphan indication EM; (3) a topical Phase 2 clinical trial in EM; and, (4) a topical Phase 2 clinical trial in PHN.

&#160;

We conducted a trial for third molar tooth extraction, which is an established acute inflammatory pain model. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in 61 healthy male subjects, of which, 41 subject s received a single oral 500 mg dose of TV-45070 and 20 subjects received placebo. Oral TV-45070 was well-tolerated with no SAEs. The most frequently reported adverse events were nausea, dizziness, headache and drowsiness, which were mild or moderate in in tensity. The primary and all secondary endpoints showed consistent trends in favor of reduced pain for TV-45070 versus placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in total pain relief at six hours post-dose. TV-45070-treated subjects experienced greater pain relief compared to subjects who received placebo (p=0.171), although the difference did not achieve the pre-defined statistical significance for the trial of p=0.1. In a post-hoc analysis, a significantly increased proportion of TV-45070-treat ed patients reported 30% or greater (p&#60;0.05) and 50% or greater (p&#60;0.05) reduction in their pain compared to placebo. 

TV-45070 was studied in both a topical formulation and an oral formulation in small, exploratory Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trials in primary EM. EM is a disorder of severe neuropathic pain where, in certain families, mutations causing increased activity of the Nav1.7 sodium channel have been identified. The disorder is characterized by recurrent flares of intense burning pain with redness of the skin in the feet, hands or both. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover design trial with four subjects comparing oral TV-45070 to placebo each administered twice per day for a duration of two days. In one treatment period, subjects received TV-45070 (400 mg bid), and in the other treatment period, subjects received placebo. The order in which the subjects received each treatment was randomized. In this oral Phase 2 EM trial, a significant (42%) reduction in pain in the two hours following an induced EM flare was observed in the three patients where pain was induced (p=0.014). There were no SAEs in this trial and the most frequently reported adverse events were dizziness, headache, sedation and drowsiness, which ranged from mild to severe. 

We also conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design trial with eight subjects (seven TV-45070 and one placebo) comparing topical 8% TV-45070 to placebo applied two times per day to the feet for a duration of 14 or 21 days. Throughout the trial, TV-45070 plasma concentrations were low and TV-45070 was well-tolerated. There was no treatment-related dizziness and drowsiness and there were no treatment-related SAEs. Local application site reactions were the most common drug-related adverse events observed. In this topical Phase 2 EM trial, three of seven patients (43%) on TV-45070 showed consistent clinically meaningful reductions in induced and daily pain compared to baseline, while the four remaining TV-45070-treated and placebo-treated subjects were considered to be non-responders based on their magnitude of response or inconsistent response or both. Also, four of six (67%) patients on TV-45070 who used rescue cooling showed a reduction in cooling usage compared to baseline and six of seven (86%) patients on TV-45070 had an improvement in sleep interference scores compared to baseline. This small exploratory trial was not designed to reach statistical significance and no such statistical significance was found. Although we and Teva have evaluated the opportunity to develop TV-45070 as a treatment for EM, Teva is currently focused on the development of TV-45070 for larger market opportunities, such as PHN, and has no current development plans for TV-45070 in EM.

We conducted a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of topical TV-45070 in 70 PHN patients. Patients enrolled into the study had refractory PHN and their average disease duration was 76.6 months. This study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial where topical (8% ointment) TV-45070 was administered twice daily with each patient receiving either TV-45070 or placebo for three weeks, then after a washout period, the subjects received the alternative treatment. In this study, Topical TV-45070 was well-tolerated with no drug-related SAEs. The results showed there was a reduction in the primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline in the mean daily pain score) for both TV-45070 and placebo, but the difference between treatments was not statistically significant. In analysis of certain secondary endpoints, there was a significantly increased proportion of TV-45070-treated patients who reported 30% or greater (p=0.049) and 50% or greater (p=0.0078) reduction in their pain compared to placebo and a retrospective exploratory analysis not described in the study protocol showed that a significant increased proportion of TV-45070-treated patients reported 30% or greater improvement in sleep (p=0.034) compared to placebo. There is a relatively common genetic variant of Nav1.7 called the R1150W gene variant. We genotyped a subset of the PHN trial subjects for R1150W status to explore if the variant could predict a greater likelihood of response to TV-45070 due to its inhibition of Nav1.7. Although it was not a pre-selected endpoint of the trial, a trend towards greater response to TV-45070 was observed in R1150W-carriers versus non-carriers, as five out of the eight evaluable subjects (63%) had a 30% or greater reduction in their pain when treated with TV-45070. TV-45070 plasma concentrations were low and TV-45070 was well-tolerated with no drug-related SAEs. No drug-related centrally mediated side effects of dizziness and drowsiness were observed in this study. In addition, while on topical TV-45070, PHN patients reported reduced site application pain (3% TV-45070 versus 16% placebo) and less pruritus, or itch, (3% TV-45070 versus 13% placebo) compared to while on placebo treatment. Chronic itch is an important co-morbidity for many PHN patients. The most frequently reported AEs included local application site reactions, nasopharyngitis and urinary tract infections.

&#160;

TV-45070 Phase 2b Clinical Trial in OA 

Using a topical (4% and 8% ointment) formulation of TV-45070, Teva completed a 300-patient, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 2b clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topically applied TV-45070 in patients with chronic pain due to OA of the knee. In July 2015, we and Teva announced top line results showing that TV-45070 did not demonstrate statistically significant difference from placebo in efficacy endpoints of reductions in pain due to OA. However, TV-45070 did demonstrate a favorable safety and tolerability profile, with no drug-related SAEs. The most common adverse events were application site dermal skin reactions which were mostly mild and less frequent than seen with other topical analgesics. There were no cardiac or central nervous system safety issues. There are no plans for further development of TV-45070 in OA and future clinical development of TV-45070 is focused on neuropathic pain, including PHN.

TV-45070 Phase 2b Clinical Trial in PHN

Based on the encouraging data from our Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in PHN, Teva is currently conducting a larger Phase 2b trial in patients with PHN. The rationale supporting the development of TV-45070 in PHN includes:

&#160;

&#183; 

We observed promising efficacy findings in our PHN Phase 2 proof of concept trial. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We observed improved responder rates for carriers of the R1150W variant in our PHN Phase 2 proof of concept trial. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Topical TV-45070 has exhibited an ability to penetrate the skin of PHN patients and reside locally, in both the skin and underlying tissue, at relatively high concentrations. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Application of TV-45070 to the human torso in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials to date resulted in low systemic exposure of TV-45070, which may reduce systemic adverse events. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Central nervous system , or CNS, side effects were not observed in the topical PHN trial due to low plasma levels, which we believe is a benefit given evidence that PHN patients have shown poor compliance with products that trigger common CNS side effects. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Topical TV-45070 in the PHN Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial reduced the incidence of itch compared to placebo. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Lidocaine, a weak sodium channel blocker, provides relief of PHN pain and is approved and widely used for this indication. 

The Phase 2b trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-site study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TV-45070 in patients with PHN. The study includes three treatment groups that receive doses of 4% or 8% of TV-45070 or placebo, dosed twice daily. Approximately 330 patients will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be stratified into treatment groups based on their R1150W status, a genetic pain biomarker believed to be related to pain susceptibility. The primary endpoint of this study is the change from baseline to week 4 in the numeric rating scale, or NRS, scores. Secondary endpoints include additional pain measurement scores at specified daily time points, the percentage of patients with greater than 30% and greater than 50% improvement in pain scores, quality of life measurements and adverse events measurements. The first patient was enrolled in April 2015, and results are expected in the second half of 2016.

About Post-Herpetic Neuralgia

PHN is a painful complication of Herpes zoster infection, occurring particularly in patients above the age of 50. Herpes zoster , otherwise known as shingles, generally manifests as a painful skin rash with blisters in a limited area on one side of the body. Pain can occur both before and during the rash, and can also persist after the infection has resolved. PHN is defined as pain that persists for 120 days or longer after the onset of rash. It is estimated that the annual incidence of Herpes zoster is between 230 and 630 cases per 100,000 people, with PHN occurring in approximately 20% of cases, resulting in approximately 200,000 PHN patients in the U.S.

Like other forms of neuropathic pain, there is a need for improved treatments for PHN. The current leading drugs used to treat PHN suffer from low efficacy for many patients and common dose limiting side effects. It has been reported that 30% to 50% of PHN patients achieve a 30% to 50% improvement in their pain with these agents. Currently prescribed treatments include Pfizer&#8217;s Lyrica, and generic forms of gabapentin, both of which target the same mechanism. Common side effects for these drugs include sleepiness, dizziness, blurred vision, edema and weight gain.

GDC-0276, GDC-0310, and Other Selective Inhibitors of Nav1.7 for the Treatment of Pain 

In December 2011, we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with Genentech and its affiliate, F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd, or Roche, to discover and develop selective oral inhibitors of Nav1.7 for the treatment of pain. For a more detailed description of the terms of this agreement with Genentech, see &#8220;&#8212;Strategic Alliances&#8221; below. Based on our discovery of Nav1.7 deficiency underlying CIP, we believe that Nav1.7 is a highly-validated target for the treatment of pain. Our Genentech collaboration is focused on discovering and developing selective oral Nav1.7 inhibitors, which is in contrast to our Teva partnership that is focused on developing a topical drug that targets a number of different sodium channels, including Nav1.7.

Genentech is currently conducting Phase 1 clinical trials for GDC-0276 and GDC-0310, which are both oral, selective Nav1.7 small-molecule inhibitors being developed for the potential treatment of pain. Both Phase 1 clinical trials are ongoing, and pending a full assessment of the results, Genentech intends to initiate a Phase 2 trial in 2016.

To study the effects of targeting Nav1.7 for the treatment of pain, we developed an animal model of inherited EM, or IEM, by expressing human Nav1.7 carrying a known IEM mutation in mice. These mice demonstrate a greater sensitivity to pain. As shown in the figure below, with a single dose of GDC-0276, these mice have fewer pain events demonstrating the ability of GDC-0276 to inhibit Nav1.7 in vivo .

&#160;

Chronic pain conditions, such as severe cancer pain and neuropathic pain, are generally recognized as unmet medical needs providing potential commercial opportunities for a new oral pain drug. Currently available pain drugs often have either a lack of meaningful pain relief or dose limiting side effects for many patients. An orally administered selective Nav1.7 inhibitor could present a novel mechanism for the treatment of moderate to severe pain as a single agent or in combination with existing analgesics that work through different mechanisms. This mechanism contrasts with our non-selective sodium channel inhibition approach taken with TV-45070. We believe that the selective inhibition of Nav1.7 may lower the potential for dose-limiting central nervous system side-effects and allow for an improved side-effect profile for oral administration of such an inhibitor, which could potentially allow for the treatment of pain that has a central or deep tissue component, including cancer pain and neuropathic pain.

We formed a second collaboration with Genentech in March 2014 for pain genetics, where we intend to focus on rare phenotypes where individuals have an inability to perceive pain or where individuals have non-precipitated spontaneous severe pain. For a more detailed description of the terms of this second agreement with Genentech, see &#8220;&#8212;Strategic Alliances&#8221; below. We believe these phenotypes may unlock new key molecular regulators of pain signaling in humans, which we will seek to validate as targets for new pain drugs. For example, we are analyzing CIP families that are not explained by Nav1.7 deficiency as well as families with conditions associated with severe pain phenotypes such as paroxysmal extreme pain disorder, or PEPD, inherited EM and cluster headache.

Selective Small-Molecule Inhibitors of Targets for the Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease 

We entered into a collaborative research and option agreement with Merck in June 2009 to discover novel targets and compounds for the treatment of cardiovascular disease using our Extreme Genetics discovery platform. For a more detailed description of the terms of our agreement with Merck, see &#8220;&#8212;Strategic Alliances&#8221; below. In 2012, Merck exercised its option to obtain an exclusive license to a target for cardiovascular disease and compound inhibitors that were discovered during the research collaboration. The target, when inhibited, is predicted to provide a beneficial lipid profile with the goal of protecting from cardiovascular disease.

Our Proprietary Product Candidates 

XEN801 for the Treatment of Acne

XEN801 is a selective, small molecule inhibitor of SCD1 being developed for the treatment of moderate to severe acne. SCD1 is an enzyme involved in lipid synthesis that is expressed in sebaceous glands in the skin. Mice deficient in SCD1 have a marked phenotype of sebaceous gland atrophy suggesting that inhibition of SCD1 activity in the skin may provide a novel treatment option for disorders of enlarged or overactive sebaceous glands, including acne. Published literature studying animals deficient in skin SCD1 have shown that these animals have lower levels of certain lipids produced by sebaceous glands, increased levels of retinoic acid, and increased levels of retinoic acid induced proteins including greatly elevated expression of Lipocalin-2, or LCN2, a gene which transcribes neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, or NGAL. NGAL has been shown to mediate sebaceous gland cell death and may also have antibacterial properties. LCN2 is also highly upregulated and NGAL levels increased in a human sebaceous gland cell line treated with a SCD1 inhibitor. Published reports on isotretinoin, an approved acne treatment, also support the theory that isotretinoin&#8217;s therapeutic effects are achieved in part through increasing levels of NGAL.

We have discovered and developed novel small-molecule SCD1 inhibitors to which we have sole rights. In multiple animal models, we have shown that our SCD1 inhibitors can reduce the size and number of sebaceous glands. XEN801 has demonstrated good properties for topical administration including formulation in a light gel and adequate skin penetration in multiple animal species.

In preclinical mouse models, XEN801 applied topically showed reduction in the size of sebaceous glands in the underlying skin in a time and dose dependent manner.

&#160;

In these preclinical mouse efficacy studies, at the vehicle treated sites, numerous normally sized lipid loaded sebaceous glands are visible whereas only very small sebaceous glands with hardly any visible lipids are present at the XEN801 treated sites. These reductions are visible after two days of twice-daily treatment and reached statistical significance after seven days (data presented in the above figure), reverting to normal levels once the treatment is stopped. Skin areas distant from the XEN801 treated sites exhibit no changes in sebaceous glands which is consistent with the observed low plasma concentrations of XEN801 and the high local concentrations found in the skin at the treated sites.

We believe these properties support the local treatment of acne and other dermatological disorders with topical XEN801 by decreasing the size of the sebaceous glands, while leaving the skin in other areas unaffected and not exposed unnecessarily to high drug concentrations. 

&#160;

Clinical Development of XEN801 

In September 2015, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of XEN801, which was completed by the end of the year. In the Phase 1 study, XEN801 was found to be safe and generally well tolerated. In total, 48 healthy volunteers were dosed for either a 14-day or 21-day treatment period. A number of different dose volumes of the 1% XEN801 drug product were evaluated in the Phase 1 clinical trial with dosing on the back and face of healthy volunteers to determine the maximum tolerated dose. As expected, the most common side effects were localized, generally mild skin reactions. No serious adverse events were observed. Maximal plasma concentrations of XEN801 were low, whereas the median skin concentration of XEN801 was above the drug concentration predicted for efficacy for all dose volumes evaluated. A Phase 2 dose was selected based on favorable tolerability and skin drug concentrations.

In February 2016, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with moderate to severe acne. The Phase 2 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study to determine the safety, tolerability, efficacy and systemic exposure of XEN801 in approximately 150 patients with moderate to severe facial acne. Patients will apply XEN801 (or vehicle placebo) topically to their face for 12-weeks with a 4-week follow up. The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change in total (inflammatory and non-inflammatory) lesion count from baseline to week 12. Secondary endpoints include the percent change in inflammatory and/or non-inflammatory lesions at different time points throughout the 12 week study as well as a number of Investigator's Global Assessment measures. We anticipate topline results in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

About Acne

Acne is a multifactorial disease of the pilosebaceous unit, which are skin structures consisting of a hair follicle and its associated sebaceous gland. Increased levels of androgens, such as testosterone, which occurs during puberty cause an enlargement of the sebaceous gland that increases the amount of sebum, a naturally occurring oil, production. Acne develops as a result of blockages in the hair follicles due to the sebaceous glands becoming clogged with excess sebum and dead skin cells. Under these conditions, the bacteria proprionibacterium acnes can multiply and cause the noticeable inflammatory lesions. We believe that topically applied SCD1 inhibitors will treat acne at its root cause by reducing the underlying sebaceous gland enlargement and reducing sebum production. With its association with the onset of puberty, acne prevalence peaks in late adolescence and is estimated to affect 40 to 50 million people in the U.S, of which there are approximately 11 million and 1.2 million individuals with moderate and severe acne, respectively.

Milder forms of acne are normally treated with over the counter products such as those containing benzoyl peroxide whereas moderate and severe forms of acne are often treated with the prescription drug isotretinoin. Isotretinoin is effective with the majority of patients reporting an improvement and approximately 50% of patients reporting remission of their acne. Scientific studies have shown that isotretinoin can cause apoptosis, a form of cell death, in sebaceous glands thereby reducing sebum production. Isotretinoin treatment has been associated with relatively common side effects including thin and dry skin, hair loss, severe acne flares, blood lipid and liver enzyme elevations. However, the most significant adverse event of isotretinoin is birth defects if taken by women during pregnancy or even a short time before conception due to its teratogenic potential. In 2005, the FDA approved a risk management plan for isotretinoin called iPLEDGE. Under this program, general practitioners are prohibited to prescribe isotretinoin and patients are referred to dermatologists registered and activated in the iPLEDGE program. In addition, patients are also required to register and qualify for the iPLEDGE program. Isotretinoin can only be dispensed for a 30-day supply (no refills) by a registered pharmacy. We believe that a safer alternative drug (without an onerous risk mitigation plan) that potently reduces sebum production may be a significant treatment option for moderate to severe acne.

Selective Small-Molecule Sodium Channel Inhibitors for the Treatment of Severe Childhood Epilepsy Disorders 

We are developing selective inhibitors of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6 as a treatment for severe childhood epilepsy disorders, such as the orphan disease DS. We have developed considerable expertise in voltage-gated sodium channel biology and have accumulated significant experience in the development of selective sodium channel inhibitors. We are leveraging this expertise and chemistry know-how for the development of selective inhibitors of Nav1.6 for the treatment of severe childhood epilepsy disorders, such as DS.

&#160;

With our collaborators from McGill University, we identified the genetic link between rare human epilepsy and mutations in the Nav1.1 gene. For example, it is now estimated that approximately 80% of DS cases are believed to be due to mutations in one c opy of the Nav1.1 voltage-gated sodium channel that cause a partial loss of Nav1.1 function. Nav1.1 plays a critical role in the normal functioning of inhibitory pathways in the brain. The lack of fully functioning Nav1.1 and inhibitory pathways allows the brain excitatory pathways to be unopposed resulting in the severe seizures of DS. The brain excitatory pathways are preferentially mediated by the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6 and therefore if we are able to selectively inhibit Nav1.6 with a small- molecule compound, we expect to taper this neuronal excitation and thereby treat rare forms of severe childhood epilepsy, such as DS. To further support inhibiting Nav1.6 as a potential therapeutic approach to treat DS and other forms of rare epilepsy, pub lished data has shown that seizures and premature death observed in a DS mouse model can be corrected when these animals are bred with a Nav1.6 knockout mouse. While DS is one of the most resistant epilepsies to treatment, there are other intractable childh ood seizures that have been associated with genetically-linked partial loss of function of Nav1.1 or gain of function of Nav1.6, which may benefit from a selective inhibitor of Nav1.6, including intractable childhood epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and sporadic infantile epileptic encephalopathy. 

Based on our experience and know-how in developing selective ion channel inhibitors, we have identified potent, selective Nav1.6 inhibitors and have demonstrated efficacy for seizures in an animal model with such an inhibitor. We expect to identify a development candidate in 2016 and file an IND application in the first half of 2017. Given the orphan nature of severe childhood epilepsies, including DS, we believe that these indications may represent attractive opportunities for us to independently develop and commercialize product candidates.

New Pipeline Opportunities

In addition to our study of rare human disorders of extreme pain or the absence of pain, we are also studying other rare disorders with extreme phenotypes that we believe could yield new drug targets in disorders where high medical need exists. Given our expertise in ion channel drug discovery, we are also focusing our discovery efforts on the identification of ion channel targets where we believe novel selective inhibitors might represent significant therapeutic advances with a focus on orphan indications.

Strategic Alliances 

Agreement with uniQure for Glybera

Effective August 2000, we entered into a sublicense and research agreement with uniQure (formerly Amsterdam Molecular Therapeutics) pursuant to which we granted to uniQure an exclusive, worldwide sublicense under certain intellectual property controlled by us to develop and commercialize technology and compounds related to the variant of LPL, called LPL S447X . Together with collaborators from UBC, we demonstrated that the LPL S447X variant resulted in increased LPL enzyme activity leading to reduced triglyceride levels in humans. Under our sublicense and research agreement with uniQure, we collaborated with uniQure and UBC on preclinical activities, and thereafter uniQure developed an LPL gene therapy product, Glybera, which contains the LPL S447X variant. Glybera was approved in the EU in October 2012 to treat LPLD in patients with severe or multiple pancreatic attacks despite dietary fat restrictions. uniQure conducted the clinical trials and is responsible for the commercialization of Glybera.

Under the terms of the agreement, we are eligible to receive mid single-digit royalties on net sales of the licensed products, for sales made by uniQure and its affiliates. The royalty rates are reduced to a low single-digit for sales made by uniQure and its affiliates in countries where a licensed technology or a licensed product is not covered by a valid patent claim. Such royalties are payable until the expiration of the last licensed patent from UBC. With respect to uniQure&#8217;s sublicense to Chiesi, we are eligible to receive a percentage in the low twenties of all non-royalty compensation relating to the licensed technology or products that uniQure receives from Chiesi (for example upfront payments and milestone payments), a percentage in the low twenties of any royalties that uniQure receives from Chiesi based on sales of technology or products covered by the licensed patents, plus a mid single-digit percentage of certain further royalties that uniQure receives from Chiesi based on sales of our licensed technology or products after the expiration of all licensed patents covering the licensed technology or products during the period expiring ten years after the date of the first sale by or on behalf of Chiesi. If uniQure grants a sublicense to a third party other than to Chiesi, then we are eligible to receive a percentage in the low twenties of all non-royalty compensation relating to the licensed technology or products that uniQure receives from such sublicensee (for example upfront payments and milestone payments), plus a percentage in the low twenties of any royalties that uniQure receives from such sublicensee based on sales of technology or products covered by the licensed patents. Although commercial sales of Glybera commenced in the fourth quarter of 2015, we do not expect to receive significant revenue in the near-term from these sales. Furthermore, royalties we are eligible to receive pursuant to our agreement with uniQure, including royalties related to sales made by Chiesi, are subject to customary royalty stacking deductions in the event that uniQure, or any of its sublicensees, have to license other technologies in order to commercialize Glybera.

&#160;

We are eligible to receive certain additional milestone payments of less than CAD$1.0 million for Glybera and for each subsequent product, if any, developed pursuant to the agreement with uniQu re. We, in turn, have certain payment obligations to our licensor, UBC, based on amounts received from uniQure or otherwise based on the exploitation of the licensed intellectual property. 

Our sublicense agreement with uniQure expires on the date of the expiration of the UBC license agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party&#8217;s default under the agreement that remains uncured for 20 days after receipt of notice from the non-breaching party.

Agreement with UBC

Effective August 2000, we entered into a license agreement with UBC pursuant to which UBC granted to us an exclusive, worldwide license under UBC&#8217;s interest in certain intellectual property controlled by UBC to develop and commercialize technology and compounds in the field of gene therapy, including products that related to the variant of LPL, called LPL S447X .

Under the terms of the agreement, UBC is eligible to receive certain pre-commercial milestone payments. UBC is also eligible to receive a mid single-digit percentage of certain compensation that we receive based on sublicenses granted by us to a third party relating to the licensed technology or products, including in connection with our sublicensing agreement with uniQure for LPL S447X .

Through December 31, 2015, we have paid to UBC upfront fees and milestone payments totaling CAD$271,000 and are obligated to pay a certain additional milestone payment of approximately CAD$200,000 for Glybera and further milestone payments of CAD$322,500 for each subsequent product, if any, developed pursuant to our sublicensing agreement with uniQure.

Our license agreement with UBC expires on the date of the expiration of the last patent granted under such license. In the event that our sublicense with uniQure is terminated, we may terminate the agreement with 30 days advance notice to UBC. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party&#8217;s default under the agreement that remains uncured for 30 days after receipt of notice from the non-breaching party, and UBC may terminate without such cure period in the event of certain types of breach by us.

Agreement with Teva for TV-45070

In December 2012, we entered into a collaborative development and license agreement with Teva, through its subsidiary, Ivax, pursuant to which we granted Teva an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize certain products, including TV-45070.Under the terms of the agreement, Teva paid us an upfront fee of $41.0 million. We are collaborating with Teva to further develop TV-45070, and Teva is funding all development costs with respect to the licensed products. In addition, we are eligible to receive potential milestone payments totaling up to $335.0 million, comprised of a $20.0 million clinical milestone payment, up to $285.0 million in regulatory milestone payments, and a $30.0 million sales-based milestone payment. If TV-45070 is approved, we are also eligible to receive royalties in the low teens to the low twenties on net sales of the licensed products for the timeframe ending upon the latest of (a) expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent covering the product, (b) the date on which such product loses market exclusivity and (c) the 10th anniversary of first commercial sale, in each case on a country-by-country basis.

We have an option to a 20% to 30% co-promotion interest for products incorporating TV-45070 in the U.S. Our exercise of this option is subject to meeting objective financial conditions, staffing requirements and compliance standards to be determined in Teva&#8217;s reasonable discretion in accordance with standard industry practice. Our co-promotion option is exercisable upon the filing of the first new drug application, or NDA, for a TV-45070 product with the FDA and we will be obligated to pay an opt-in fee to Teva, which is calculated by multiplying our co-promotion interest (as a percentage) by the amount of certain milestones paid or payable by Teva, to which is added certain past and future development costs incurred by Teva with respect to the product for the U.S. Our co-promotion interest is in the 20% to 30% range, and equals our percentage share of detailing activities and co-promotion expenses. Such opt-in fee is payable as a reduction to the milestone payments or our share of operating profits that Teva would otherwise owe to us or a combination of the two. If we exercise this option, upon paying an opt-in fee to Teva, we will be eligible to receive, in lieu of royalties with respect to such product sales in the U.S., a percentage share (equal to our co-promotion interest) of operating profits from such product sales in the U.S.

&#160;

Our agreement with Teva expires on the date of the expiration of all payment obligations to us under the agreement. Teva may terminate the agreement with 60 days adva nced written notice to us after at least three Phase 2 (or later stage) clinical trials have been completed or in the event that safety or efficacy issues arise in the development of the licensed products. Either party may terminate the agreement in the ev ent of the other party&#8217;s material breach which remains uncured for 90 business days. In certain termination circumstances, we would receive licenses to Teva intellectual property relating to TV-45070 clinical development and regulatory filings. If patents within such Teva intellectual property cover the TV-45070 product, then Teva is eligible to receive royalties from us based on a percentage of net product sales, within the mid single-digit range. Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with Teva, an affili ate of Teva purchased 1,111,111 common shares in our initial public offering, based upon the initial public offering price of $9.00 per share. 

Agreements with Genentech for GDC-0276, GDC-0310, and Selective Inhibitors of Nav1.7 and Pain Genetics

In December 2011, we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with Genentech and its affiliate, Roche, to discover and develop small and large molecules that selectively inhibit the Nav1.7 sodium channel and companion diagnostics for the potential treatment of pain. Pursuant to this agreement, we granted Genentech a worldwide exclusive license to develop and commercialize compounds directed to Nav1.7 and products incorporating such compounds for all uses. We also granted Genentech a worldwide non-exclusive license to diagnostic products for the purpose of developing or commercializing such compounds.

Under the terms of the agreement, Genentech paid us an upfront fee of $10.0 million, a $5.0 million milestone payment for the selection of GDC-0276 for development and an $8.0 million milestone payment upon the approval by Health Canada of the clinical trial application, or CTA, for GDC-0276. Genentech is providing funding to us for certain of our full-time equivalents, or FTEs, performing the research collaboration plan. In addition, we are eligible to receive pre-commercial and commercial milestone payments with respect to the licensed products totaling up to an additional $613.0 million, comprised of up to $45.5 million in preclinical and clinical milestone payments, up to $387.5 million in regulatory milestone payments, and up to $180.0 million in sales-based milestone payments for multiple products and indications. In addition, we are eligible to receive royalties based on net sales of the licensed products, which range from a mid single-digit percentage to ten percent for small-molecule inhibitors for the timeframe that such products are covered by the licensed patents and a low single-digit percentage thereafter until the date that is ten years after first commercial sale on a country-by-country basis, plus a low single-digit percentage for large molecule inhibitors of Nav1.7 for a period of ten years from first commercial sale on a country-by-country basis.

Our agreement with Genentech expires on the date of the expiration of all payment obligations to us under the agreement. Genentech may terminate the agreement with three months advance notice anytime on or after the third anniversary of the effective date of the agreement, and each party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party that remains uncured after 90 days. In the event that Genentech terminates the agreement due to our breach, Genentech retains its licenses and its payment obligations to us are reduced. In the event that we terminate the agreement due to Genentech&#8217;s breach, the rights and licenses granted to Genentech revert back to us, subject to certain rights to make and use certain large-molecule product candidates that are retained by Genentech, and Genentech is obligated to assign certain regulatory approvals and grant certain licenses to us to enable us to develop and commercialize certain terminated products outside of the collaboration.

In May 2015, we amended the collaborative research and license agreement to leverage the work performed in our ongoing Nav1.7 pain collaboration with Genentech for use in our research and development program directed towards modulators of Nav1.6 for use in the field of treating epilepsy, including DS. Pursuant to the amendment, we obtained a worldwide, non-exclusive, revocable license under intellectual property previously licensed by us to Genentech and intellectual property developed under the Nav1.7 collaboration that is necessary or useful to make and use certain Nav1.6 modulators for use in the field, excluding commercialization. We obtained a right of first negotiation for a certain period of time to obtain a worldwide, exclusive license under the intellectual property licensed to us to commercialize certain Nav1.6 modulators to treat any disease in the field. We also granted Genentech a right of first negotiation to enter into a drug research and development collaboration with us for our Nav1.6 program. Genentech can terminate the license upon 90 days&#8217; notice after the third anniversary of the amendment or at any time upon our uncured material breach.

Pursuant to the amendment, we granted Genentech a worldwide exclusive license under intellectual property developed under our Nav1.6 program. The license permits Genentech to develop and commercialize compounds identified or first made in our Nav1.6 program for all uses outside the field of epilepsy and to develop and commercialize compounds (other than certain compounds identified or first made in our Nav1.6 program) for all uses. If Genentech reaches certain development milestones for and/or sells certain compounds identified or first made in our Nav1.6 program that are covered by a patent licensed to Genentech under the amendment, products containing such compound would be included in the products subject to the royalty and milestone obligations payable to us under the original agreement. The collaborative research and license agreement was amended again in December 2015 to extend the term of the research program. 

&#160;

In March 2014, we entered into an additional agreement with Genentech for pain genetics, where we intend to use our Extreme Genetics discovery platform to focus on identifying genetic targets associated with rare phenotypes where individuals have an inabi lity to perceive pain or where individuals have non-precipitated spontaneous severe pain. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, any intellectual property arising out of the collaboration will be jointly owned by us and Genentech. We have also granted Ge nentech a time-limited, exclusive right of first negotiation on a target-by-target basis to form joint drug discovery collaborations. Under the terms of this agreement, Genentech paid us an upfront payment of $1.5 million, a $0.25 million milestone payment related to the identification of a novel pain target in September 2015, and we are eligible for an additional $1.75 million in milestone payments. The agreement terminates upon the expiration of Genentech&#8217;s time-limited, exclusive right of first negotiati on which shall be exercisable for two years. Genentech may terminate the agreement with three months advance notice anytime on or after the 12 month anniversary of the effective date of the agreement, and each party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party that remains uncured for 90 days. Furthermore, pursuant to the terms of a common share put agreement, an affiliate of Genentech, Roche Finance Ltd., invested approximately $4.5 million in a private placement concurr ent with our initial public offering at the same price per share as the initial public offering. 

Agreement with Merck for Cardiovascular Disease

In June 2009, we entered into an exclusive collaborative research and option agreement with Merck, pursuant to which the parties conducted a research program to discover and develop novel small-molecule candidates for the potential treatment of cardiovascular disease. Merck provided payments to us for our FTEs who performed our activities pursuant to the research program conducted under the Merck agreement. The Merck collaborative research program ended in December 2012.

Under the terms of the agreement, Merck had the option to obtain an exclusive license under certain intellectual property controlled by us to develop and commercialize compounds and products directed to targets in the research program, which has now expired. In June 2012, Merck exercised its option and paid us $2.0 million to obtain such a worldwide exclusive license to develop and commercialize compound inhibitors of a target that was identified using our Extreme Genetics discovery platform. Through December 31, 2015, we have received milestone payments and an option fee totaling $9.0 million, and we are eligible for further research, development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $64.0 million, comprised of $21.0 million in preclinical and clinical milestone payments and up to $43.0 million in regulatory milestone payments for products directed to the licensed target, as well as royalties from the mid to high single-digit range in countries where such products are covered by a valid composition or method of use claim of a Xenon or Merck patent or, if not covered by such claims, royalties in the mid single-digit range for ten years after first commercial sale of such products.

We have an option to co-fund the Phase 1 and first Phase 2 clinical trials of product candidates licensed by Merck by paying Merck 50% of such development costs. Such co-funding option is available at the IND-filing stage for the applicable product candidate. If we exercise our co-funding option then the maximum eligible milestone amounts due to us increase to $86.5 million and the royalties increase to the high single-digit to the sub-teen double-digit range.

Our agreement with Merck expires on the date of the expiration of all royalty payment obligations to us under the agreement. Merck has the right to terminate the agreement upon providing certain notices to us. Each party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party that remains uncured for 90 days after notice of such breach. In the event that Merck terminates the agreement due to our breach, the licenses granted to Merck survive and becomes fully paid up. In the event that we terminate the agreement due to Merck&#8217;s breach, the licenses granted to Merck terminate.

Intellectual Property

As part of our business strategy, we generally file patent applications disclosing and claiming the drug targets and their novel uses that we identified with the use of our Extreme Genetics discovery platform, novel compositions that modulate such targets, methods of making and using such compositions and various therapeutic formulations of such compositions that cover our product candidates. In some cases, we also file claims on screening assays as well as compositions and methods for use in diagnosing certain diseases. We generally file applications in the U.S., Canada, the EU and other commercially significant foreign jurisdictions. We also rely on trade secrets, internal know-how, technological innovations and agreements with third parties to develop, maintain and protect our competitive position. Our ability to be competitive will depend on the success of this strategy.

As of December 31, 2015, we owned, co-owned or licensed 56 issued or allowed U.S. patents and approximately 20 pending U.S. patent applications, including provisional and non-provisional filings. We also owned, co-owned or licensed an additional 639 pending and granted counterpart applications worldwide, including 161 country-specific validations of 11 European patents.

&#160;

We have in-licensed from UBC patent applications and patents related to Glybera, and methods of making and using Glybera. These include European Patent No. 1,200,117, Japan ese Patent No. 5,095,894, Canadian Patent No. 2,370,081 and the allowed U.S. Patent Application No. 14/324,151. European Patent No. 1,200,117, Japanese Patent No. 5,095,894 and Canadian Patent No. 2,370,081, are expected to expire in June 2020 (absent any extensions of term); U.S. Patent Application No. 14/324,151, when issued, is expected to expire in June 2020 (absent any extensions of term). In addition, U.S. Patent No. 6,814,962 has claims directed to the use of various recombinant viruses containing LP L coding sequences to treat various pathologies and is expected to expire in November 2020 (absent any extensions of term). 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned eight issued U.S. patents and seven pending U.S. patent applications related to TV-45070, and methods of making and using this and certain related compounds. The issued patents are expected to expire between 2026 and 2030 (absent any extensions of term). In addition, we have 67 foreign issued patents (exclusive of European patent national validation) and have filed 145 corresponding applications in various foreign jurisdictions relating to TV-45070 and certain related compounds.

As of December 31, 2015, we, together with Genentech, co-owned two issued U.S. patents, two pending U.S. patent applications and 30 pending counterpart patent applications worldwide relating to GDC-0276 and methods of making and using this and certain related compounds. The issued patents, as well as patents issuing from these applications are expected to expire in 2033 (absent any extensions of term). We also co-owned with Genentech one pending U.S. patent application, one pending PCT international application, and three corresponding applications in various foreign jurisdictions relating to GDC-0310 and certain related compounds. Any patents issuing from these applications are expected to expire between 2034 and 2035 (absent any extensions of term).

As of December 31, 2015, we owned or co-owned four issued U.S. patents related to XEN801, and methods of making and using this and certain related compounds. These issued patents are expected to expire between 2024 and 2028 (absent any extensions of term). In addition, we have 27 foreign issued patents (exclusive of European patent national validation) and have filed nine corresponding applications in various foreign jurisdictions relating to XEN801 and certain related compounds.

We may obtain patents on our novel compositions before we obtain marketing approval for product candidates containing such compositions. Because patents are only valid for a limited period, and the life of a particular patent may begin prior to the commercial sale of the related product, the commercial value of any patent is limited. However, in certain circumstances, we may be able to seek patent term extensions for patents in the U.S. and in a number of European countries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval, but we cannot be certain we will obtain such extensions.

Further, the existence of issued patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize any product candidate covered by such a patent. Third parties may have or obtain rights to other patents that could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates. If these other parties are successful in obtaining valid and enforceable patents, and establishing our infringement of those patents, we could be prevented from commercializing our product candidates unless we were able to obtain a license under such patents, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

In the conduct of our business, we may infringe patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. If we do infringe such patents or other proprietary rights, we could be prevented from developing or selling products or from using the processes covered by those patents, could be required to pay substantial damages or could be required to obtain a license from the third party to allow us to use their technology, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are not able to obtain a required license or develop alternative technologies, we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products, and our business could be adversely affected.

Much of our scientific capabilities depend upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key scientific and technical personnel. To protect our rights to our proprietary know-how and technology, we require all our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements that require disclosure and assignment to us of ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by these employees, consultants and advisors in the course of their service to us.

&#160;

We may be unable to obtain, ma intain and protect the intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business, and we may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, which could materially harm our business. Although we b elieve our patents and patent applications provide us with a competitive advantage, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We and our collaborators may not be abl e to develop patentable product candidates or processes or obtain patents from pending patent applications. Even if patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned by o r licensed to us or to our collaborators. In certain cases where we have licensed rights to our intellectual property to our collaborators, such collaborators have assumed control of the prosecution and maintenance of the intellectual property portfolio re lated to such licensed rights. If our collaborators fail to adequately prosecute or maintain any portion of our licensed intellectual property, the competitive advantage and value of our intellectual property portfolio may be reduced. For more information, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property Rights.&#8221; 

We own a number of trademarks and intend to develop names for our product candidates and as appropriate seek to secure trademark protection for them, including domain name registration, in relevant jurisdictions.

Competition

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience, scientific knowledge and drug discovery approach provide us with certain advantages, we face potential competition in target discovery and product development from many different approaches and sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates or products that we or our collaborators successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products and new products that may become available in the future.

With respect to target discovery activities, competitors and other third parties, including academic and clinical researchers, may be able to access rare families and identify targets before we do.

Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaboration arrangements with large and established companies.

The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of alternative products, the level of competition and the availability of coverage, and adequate reimbursement from government and other third party payers.

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products or therapies that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products.

Aside from the product marketplace, our competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites, recruiting patients for clinical trials, and by acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.

Our partnered products and proprietary product candidates that are currently approved or are in clinical development may compete with various therapies and drugs, both in the marketplace and currently under development.

Glybera (alipogene tiparvovec) Competition

There are no approved gene therapies currently on the market for LPLD. The current management of LPLD consists of strict adherence to an extremely low-fat diet, but compliance with such a diet is challenging. Lipid-lowering drugs are generally not effective for treating LPLD. We are not aware of any other drugs or therapies currently in development that treat LPLD by using the LPL sequence containing the LPL S447X genetic variant or otherwise.

&#160;

TV-45070, GDC-0276, and GDC-0310 Competition 

Drug discovery and development for various pain applications is intensely competitive. There are a large number of approved products for neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain and other pain indications. These approved products include capsaicin, celecoxib, lidocaine, narcotic analgesics and pregabalin. We are also aware of clinical-stage development programs at several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are developing Nav1.7 inhibitors or other sodium channel inhibitors for the treatment of pain, including Biogen Inc., Dainippon Sumitomo Co., Ltd., Eli Lilly and Company, Merck, NeuroQuest Inc., and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Moreover, we are aware of various other product candidates in development that target other mechanisms of action to treat various pain indications, including calcium channel inhibitors, nerve growth factor inhibitors and P2X purinoceptor 3 inhibitors.

XEN801 Competition

If XEN801 were approved for the treatment of acne, we anticipate it would compete with other approved prescription acne products including topical retinoids, oral hormonal therapies, topical and oral antimicrobials, and oral isotretinoin. In addition to approved prescription therapies, there are a wide range of over-the-counter, or OTC, treatments targeted at treating acne. Additionally, there are a number of prescription products that are used &#8220;off-label&#8221; for the treatment of acne. We are also aware of several products in clinical development that could potentially compete with XEN801, including products in development from Allergan PLC, AOBiome LLC, Braintree Laboratories Inc., Cassiopea SpA, Dermira Inc., Foamix Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Galderma SA, Mimetica Pty Ltd, Novan Therapeutics, Phosphagenics Ltd, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, and XBiotech Inc.

Government Regulation

We are developing both small-molecule and large-molecule product candidates. Our small-molecule product candidates are regulated as drugs by the FDA. The gene therapy product, Glybera, would be regulated by the FDA as a biologic. Within the FDA, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, regulates drugs and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates biological products. Drugs and biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&#38;C Act, and other federal, provincial, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Biological products are also subject to regulation under the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act. Both the FD&#38;C Act and the PHS Act, as applicable, and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, import, export, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving drugs and biological products. FDA approval must be obtained before clinical testing of drugs or biological products is initiated, and each clinical study protocol for such product candidates is reviewed by the FDA prior to initiation in the U.S. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of drugs and biological products in the U.S. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, provincial, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.

Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. In particular, ethical, social and legal concerns about genetic testing, genetic research and gene therapy could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use in discovering and developing our products candidates and in manufacturing and marketing Glybera and any other gene therapy products we or our collaborators may develop. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

U.S. Drug Development Process

The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin; 

&#160;

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA&#8217;s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for its intended use; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA for drug products or a biological license application, or BLA, for biologic al products for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical studies; &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with good manufacturing practices, or GMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; 

&#160;

&#183; 

potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA, or licensure of the BLA. 

Before testing any drug or biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.

The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.

Clinical studies involve the administration of the drug or biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor&#8217;s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.

Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 1 . The drug or biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 2 . The drug or biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 3 . Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 

Post-approval clinical studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA recommends that sponsors observe subjects in studies of gene therapy products for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of study subjects. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators.

&#160;

Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the drug or biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength , quality, potency and purity of the final drug or biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug or biological product candidate does not undergo una cceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics, and studies of gene therapy products are subject to certain regulatory requirements in addition to those set forth above including certain requirements of the National Institutes of Health.

U.S. Review and Approval Processes

After the completion of clinical studies of a drug or biological product, FDA approval of an NDA or a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the drug or biological product, respectively. The NDA or BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or a BLA or supplement to an NDA or a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the NDA or BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for drugs and biologics and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs or biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.

Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews an NDA or BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any marketing application that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA or BLA. The FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with GMP to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the application without a REMS, if required.

Before approving an NDA or a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure GMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.

&#160;

Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the marketing application, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the application identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issu ed, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval clinical studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies, designed to further assess a product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.

One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to complete its review of 90% of standard NDAs and BLAs within ten months from filing and 90% of priority NDAs and BLAs within six months from filing, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the application sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.

Fast Track Designation

The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, which are intended to expedite the process for reviewing drugs. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to expedite the FDA&#8217;s review of drugs that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Under the Fast Track process, drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, may also receive priority review by the FDA, or review within six months of the filing of an NDA compared to a traditional review time of ten months. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval of a drug, for Fast Track designated drugs, the FDA will also attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug, to expedite such drug&#8217;s review and development. Although FDA has granted fast track designations to TV-45070 for EM and to Glybera for LPLD, such designations may not result in a faster development or review time, do not increase the odds of approval, and may be rescinded at any time if these drug candidates do not continue to meet the qualifications for these programs.

Orphan Drug Designation

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Both Glybera and TV-45070 have received orphan drug designation from the FDA. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

&#160;

If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for such drug for the disease or condition for which it has s uch designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but f or a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our pro duct candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#8217;s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the EU has similar, but not identical, benefits, including up to ten years of exclusivity. 

Post-Approval Requirements

Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, provincial, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of drug and biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to drug and biological products, include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After an NDA or BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer&#8217;s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of drug and biological products.

We also must comply with the FDA&#8217;s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product&#8217;s approved labeling (known as &#8220;off-label use&#8221;), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.

Drug and biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drug or biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

&#160;

U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.

Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, a drug product containing a new chemical entity as its active ingredient is entitled to five years of market exclusivity, and a product for which the sponsor is required to generate new clinical data is entitled to three years of market exclusivity. A drug or biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued &#8220;Written Request&#8221; for such a study.

The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.

A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant&#8217;s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics&#8217; patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.

Additional Regulation

In addition to the foregoing, provincial, state and federal U.S. and Canadian laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.

U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, to which we are subject, prohibit corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We can also be held liable for the acts of our third party agents under the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

&#160;

Government Regulation Outside of the U.S. 

In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.

Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the EU, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country&#8217;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country&#8217;s requirements, clinical study development may proceed.

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, coverage, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The application used to file the NDA or BLA in the U.S. is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the EU, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator&#8217;s data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator&#8217;s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU&#8217;s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Products receiving orphan designation in the EU can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no similar medicinal product for the same indication may be placed on the market. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.

The criteria for designating an &#8220;orphan medicinal product&#8221; in the EU are similar in principle to those in the U.S. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Glybera has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of LPLD in the EU.

The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if:

&#160;

&#183; 

the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. 

For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, coverage, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

&#160;

If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspe nsion or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, managed care plans, private health insurers, and other organizations. These third-party payers may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Third-party payers may attempt to control costs by limiting coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication, and by limiting the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments.

The cost of pharmaceuticals and devices continues to generate substantial governmental and third party payer interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payer&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

Some third-party payers also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and to operate profitably.

In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payers, that coverage or an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third-party payers&#8217; reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.

Healthcare Reform

In the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs.

In the U.S., the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the Medicare Modernization Act, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The Medicare Modernization Act expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly by establishing Medicare Part D and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician administered drugs under Medicare Part B. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class under the new Medicare Part D program. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and reimbursement rate that we receive for any of our approved products. While the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the Medicare Modernization Act may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers.

&#160;

In March 2010, the President signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, or PPACA, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, redu ce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufac turers and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, PPACA revises the definition of &#8220;average manufacturer price&#8221; for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners and a significa nt number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective. Although it is too early to determine the full effect of PPACA, the new law appears likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medic are program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. These new laws may result in reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.

We expect that PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our future revenue. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.

In addition, different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may be marketed only once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. Some of these countries may require, as condition of obtaining reimbursement or pricing approval, the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements

In the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, provincial, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with fraud and abuse laws such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, as amended, the federal False Claims Act, as amended, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.

&#160;

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly and willfully sol iciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal hea lthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. The term &#8220;remuneration &#8221; is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment s, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criter ia for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the recently enacted PPACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute su ch that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or serv ices resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Additionally, many states have adopt ed laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs in at least some case s, and do not contain safe harbors. 

The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a federal healthcare program. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, improper promotion of off-label uses (i.e., uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug&#8217;s label), and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Our future activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, provincial, state and third party reimbursement of our products, and the sale and marketing of our products and our service arrangements or data purchases, among other activities, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance. Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. For example, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform federal standards for certain &#8220;covered entities&#8221; (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included expansion of HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to &#8220;business associates&#8221;&#8212;independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#8217;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.

&#160;

There are also an increasing number of state &#8220;sunshine&#8221; laws that require manuf acturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data t o pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. In addition, beginning in 2013, a similar federal requirement began requiring manufacturers to track and report to the federal governmen t certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The federal government discloses the r eported information on a publicly available website. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. 

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-approval requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.

Environmental Matters

Our operations require the use of hazardous materials (including biological materials) which subject us to a variety of federal, provincial and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of the regulations under the current regulatory structure provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or someone else&#8217;s, business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We cannot predict how changes in laws or development of new regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we had 83 employees, including 76 full-time employees. Of our employees, 55 were primarily engaged in research and development, and 25 of whom hold a Ph.D. or M.D. (or equivalent) degree. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

Research and Development

We have committed, and expect to continue to commit, significant resources to developing new product candidates. We have assembled experienced research and development teams at our Burnaby, British Columbia location with scientific, clinical and regulatory personnel. Our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $15.2 million, $11.8 million, and $12.3 million, respectively.

Manufacturing

We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties and our collaborators for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. Accordingly, we have not internally developed any manufacturing facilities or hired related personnel.

To date, we have obtained materials for our product candidates from multiple third-party manufacturers. We believe that all of the materials required for the manufacture of our product candidates can be obtained from more than one source. However, the manufacturing processes for each of our product candidates, which include large and small-molecules, vary and sourcing adequate supplies may be made more difficult depending on the type of product candidate involved. Our small-molecule product candidates generally can be manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. This chemistry generally is amenable to scale-up and does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process.

&#160;
