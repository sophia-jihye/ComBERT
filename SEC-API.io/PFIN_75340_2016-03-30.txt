 ITEM 1. Business 

&#160;

P&#38;F Industries, Inc. (&#8220;P&#38;F&#8221;) is a Delaware corporation incorporated on April 19, 1963. P&#38;F and each of its subsidiaries are herein referred to collectively as the &#8220;Company.&#8221; In addition, the words &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; refer to the Company. The Company operates in two primary lines of business, or segments: (i) tools and other products (&#8220;Tools&#8221;) and (ii) hardware and accessories (&#8220;Hardware&#8221;).

&#160;

Tools 

&#160;

The Company conducts its Tools business through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Continental Tool Group, Inc. (&#8220;Continental&#8221;), which in turn currently operates through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Florida Pneumatic Manufacturing Corporation (&#8220;Florida Pneumatic&#8221;) and Hy-Tech Machine, Inc. (&#8220;Hy-Tech&#8221;). During the third quarter of 2014, the Company acquired Exhaust Technologies Inc. (&#8220;ETI&#8221;), a developer and distributor of pneumatic tools, through a merger between a newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of Florida Pneumatic and ETI. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2014 Florida Pneumatic acquired all of the outstanding shares of Universal Air Tool Company Limited (&#8220;UAT&#8221;), a distributor of pneumatic tools located in High Wycombe, England. UAT markets pneumatic tools primarily to the automotive market sector in the United Kingdom and Ireland. This acquisition provides the Company with direct entry into the European pneumatic tool market for the Company&#8217;s entire suite of air tool products. Both ETI and UAT are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Florida Pneumatic, and unless otherwise indicated, the operations and results of operations of Florida Pneumatic herein include ETI and UAT as of the respective dates such companies were acquired. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2014, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of Air Tool Service Company (&#8220;ATSCO&#8221;), through a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hy-Tech, and unless otherwise indicated, the operations and results of operations of Hy-Tech herein include ATSCO as of the date the business was acquired.

&#160;

Florida Pneumatic 

&#160;

Florida Pneumatic imports and sells pneumatic hand tools, most of which are of its own design, primarily to the retail, industrial and automotive markets. This line of products includes sanders, grinders, drills, saws and impact wrenches. These tools are similar in appearance and function to electric hand tools, but are powered by compressed air, rather than directly by electricity. Air tools, as they are more commonly referred to, generally are less expensive to operate, offer better performance and weigh less than their electrical counterparts. Florida Pneumatic imports approximately seventy-five types of pneumatic hand tools, most of which are sold at prices ranging from $50 to $1,000, under the names &#8220;Florida Pneumatic&#8221;, &#8220;Universal Tool,&#8221; AIRCAT or NITROCAT, as well as under the trade names or trademarks of several private label customers. These products are sold to retailers, distributors, and private label customers through in-house sales personnel and manufacturers&#8217; representatives. The AIRCAT and NITROCAT brand of pneumatic tools are sold primarily to the automotive market. Users of Florida Pneumatic&#8217;s hand tools include industrial maintenance and production staffs, do-it-yourself mechanics, automobile mechanics and auto body personnel.

&#160;

During 2015, Florida Pneumatic purchased approximately 49% of its pneumatic tools from China, 50% from Taiwan and 1% from Japan and Europe. Florida Pneumatic performs final assembly on certain of its products at its factory in Jupiter, Florida.

&#160;

Florida Pneumatic also markets, through its Berkley Tool division (&#8220;Berkley&#8221;), a product line which includes pipe and bolt dies, pipe taps, wrenches, vises and stands, pipe and tubing cutting equipment, hydrostatic test pumps, and replacement electrical components for a widely-used brand of pipe cutting and threading machines. Florida Pneumatic markets Berkley&#8217;s products through industrial distributors and contractors. Florida Pneumatic sources its Berkley product line from China and Israel, as well as domestic sources. Florida Pneumatic also assembles and markets a line of compressor air filters, for which it imports components from Mexico.

&#160;

There are redundant supply sources for nearly all products purchased.

&#160;

The primary competitive factors in the industrial pneumatic tool market are quality, breadth and availability of products, customer service and technical support. The primary competitive factors in the retail pneumatic tool market are price, service and brand-name awareness. The primary competitive factors in Berkley&#8217;s business are price and service. Florida Pneumatic&#8217;s products are sold off the shelf. Currently, Florida Pneumatic&#8217;s retail business is not seasonal.

&#160;

Hy-Tech manufacturers and distributes its own line of industrial pneumatic tools and parts under the &#8220;ATP&#8221; brand. Under the ATP brand, Hy-Tech produces and sells over sixty types of pneumatic tools, which include impact wrenches, grinders, drills, and motors that are sold at prices ranging from $450 to $28,000.

It also produces a line of siphons under the &#8220;Eureka&#8221; name. Other than a line of sockets sold under the &#8220;OZAT&#8221; brand name that are imported from Israel, all Hy-Tech products are made in the United States of America. In August 2014, a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of Hy-Tech, acquired substantially all of the assets comprising the business of ATSCO, an Ohio-based corporation engaged in the design, manufacture and distribution of pneumatic tools and parts. Following a transition period that lasted into middle of 2015, all ATSCO products are now manufactured in Hy-Tech&#8217;s primary facility located in Cranberry, PA.

&#160;

Hy-Tech products are sold through its in-house sales force as well as manufacturer representatives. Hy-Tech&#8217;s products are sold off the shelf and also are produced to customer&#8217;s specifications.

&#160;

The business is not seasonal but may be subject to periodic schedule changes in refineries, power generation and chemical plants. The primary competitive factors in the industrial pneumatic tool market are quality, breadth and availability of products, customer service and technical support.
