Overview 

&#160; 

We were incorporated on September 27, 2006 in Nevada as Sunrise Global, Inc. Until closing of the Acquisition of Greenkraft on December 6, 2013 (as described below), we were a recycled industrial waste resale company. On December 27, 2013, we changed our corporate name to Greenkraft, Inc. from Sunrise Global, Inc., which name change reflects our acquisition of Greenkraft resulting in us now conducting Greenkraft&#8217;s business. Concurrent with the name change, we effectuated a 2-for-1 forward split, also effective December 27, 2013. All share amounts have been adjusted to give effect to the reverse split. 

&#160; 

We are a manufacturer and distributor of automotive products. We manufacture commercial forward trucks for vehicle classes 3,4, 5, 6, and 7 (GVW ranging from 10,001 lbs. to 33,000 lbs.) in alternative fuels. We also manufacture and sell alternative fuel systems to convert petroleum based fuels to natural gas and propane fuels. 

&#160; 

Our executive offices are located at 2530 S. Birch Street, Santa Ana, CA 92707. Our telephone number is (714) 545-7777 and our Internet address is www.greenkraftinc.com .

&#160; 

Acquisition of Greenkraft, Inc. 

&#160; 

On December 5, 2013, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with the sole stockholder (the &#8220;Stockholder&#8221;) of Greenkraft, Inc., a California corporation (&#8220;Greenkraft&#8221;), pursuant to which, on December 6, 2013 (the &#8220;Closing Date&#8221;), we issued 83,000,000 shares (as adjusted to give effect for the 2-for-1 forward split effectuated on December 27, 2013) of our common stock to the Stockholder in consideration of the Stockholder&#8217;s transfer of all of his Greenkraft shares to our wholly-owned acquisition subsidiary, Greenkraft, Inc, a Nevada corporation (the &#8220;Acquisition Subsidiary)., at which time Greenkraft became Acquisition Subsidiary&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary (the &#8220;Acquisition&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Prior to the Acquisition, Greenkraft was our controlling stockholder, owning approximately 68% of our common stock which it purchased in May 2014. In addition, George Gemayel, Greenkraft&#8217;s sole shareholder, president and director, was appointed as our president and sole director in connection with their purchase of the controlling interest in May 2013. 

&#160; 

As a condition to the closing of the Acquisition, on the Closing Date, 4,600,000 shares (as adjusted to give effect for the 2-for-1 forward split effectuated on December 27, 2013) of our issued and outstanding common stock previously held by Greenkraft were cancelled pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Cancelled Shares&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Following the Acquisition, we now conduct operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Greenkraft. 

&#160; 

Industry Overview 

&#160; 

The combination of environmental pressures, regulations, and alternative fuel vehicle initiatives has resulted in the transportation industry offering environmentally friendly, fuel-efficient vehicles. Currently automotive manufacturers are actively engaged in the competitive pursuit of innovative, clean, alternative fuel vehicles &#8211; particularly as they strive to meet new emissions rules and contribute to reducing greenhouse gases. These alternative fuel vehicles can provide needed performance, sustained mobility, and immediate emissions reductions in the industry. Compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are abundantly available in the US, and a growing network of fueling stations exists in California. Light- and medium-duty service trucks are utilized by a growing business sector. Developing these vehicles to run on CNG, LPG, and electric will offer a cleaner fuel choice for these business operators without sacrificing availability, safety, or convenience. 

&#160; 

Natural gas powers about 112,000 vehicles in the United State and roughly 14.8 million vehicles worldwide. Natural gas vehicles which can run on compressed natural gas are good choices for high mileage centrally fueled fleets which operate within a limited area. For vehicles needing to travel long distances, liquefied natural gas is a good choice. CNG and LNG are considered alternative fuels under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. 

&#160; 

Today&#8217;s fleets are increasingly interested in medium and heavy duty vehicles that use alternative fuels or advanced technologies that can help reduce operating costs, meet emission requirements and support US energy independence. Vehicle and engine manufacturers are responding to this interest with a wide range of options across a steadily growing number of vehicle applications. 

&#160; 

Our business expects to benefit from the availability of government tax incentives, such as tax credits and grants to encourage the use of natural gas in trucks, buses and other vehicles. On December 31, 2012, the United States Congress passed the American Tax Relief Act of 2012, which extended the Alternative Fuels Excise Tax Credit of U.S. $0.50 per gallon for LNG and U.S. $0.50 per GGE of CNG until December 31, 2014 and also made those credits retroactive to January 1, 2012. In addition, the Alternative Fuel Vehicle 

&#160; 

Fueling Infrastructure Credit of 30% of the cost of any qualified alternative fuel vehicle refueling property placed in service during the taxable year, not to exceed U.S. $30,000 in the case of a property of a character subject to an allowance for depreciation, and U.S. $1,000 in any other case, was also extended until December 31, 2014 and made retroactive to January 1, 2012. There were other incentives available for fueling infrastructure with different agencies as well during 2015 and to present. 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In the absence of federal legislation, individual states have initiated and passed bills to provide incentives to encourage the use of domestic energy sources such as natural gas. Texas Senate Bills 20 and 385 have been passed and authorize funding for approximately U.S. $16 million for natural gas vehicle rebates, which includes converting heavy-duty fleet vehicles to natural gas, and U.S. $4 million per year for the next two years for the establishment of natural gas stations between the cities of Dallas, San Antonio and Houston. California, through the CEC with funds through Assembly Bill 118, has established the Natural Gas Vehicle Buy-Down Program, a rebate program to incentivize the deployment of natural gas and propane vehicles in all weight classes in California. Funding for this program for 2012 was U.S. $12.7 million. No date for 2014 applications has been announced. California also has programs authorized by Proposition 1B that periodically make funding available to promote the use of cleaner heavy-duty trucks within the state. Pennsylvania through House Bill 1950 authorizes U.S. $20 million over three years in vehicle and transit grants of up to U.S. $20,000 per vehicle. Other states such as Louisiana, Oklahoma, and West Virginia offer state income tax credits for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles including natural gas. 

&#160; 

Our Principal Products and Services 

&#160; 

We currently offer two main products and services at this time: 

&#160; 

1. Commercial forward cabin trucks that run on alternative fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied propane gas (LPG) &#160; 

2. Conversion of existing vehicles to run on alternative fuels such as CNG, or LPG. &#160; 

Commercial Forward Cab Trucks with Alternative Fuels 

&#160; 

We currently offer commercial trucks (Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) with dedicated natural gas fuel system for 6.0 liter Greenkraft/General Motor (GM) engines for 14,000 lbs. and above gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) trucks and custom chassis manufacturers. We offer a range of Class 3-7 cab-forward trucks based on chassis from JAC, China&#8217;s Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Company. We then install 6.0-liter GM engines and our CNG fuel systems and adds Quantum Technologies&#8217; tanks in the vehicle. The CNG fuel systems are assembled by Greenkraft using parts manufactured by various suppliers. The chassis and cabin are imported from overseas and the powertrain is assembled in the chassis. Prior to order of the chassis, we provided specific design specifications to JAC to ensure that the chassis comply with US guidelines and specifications. We have received California Air Resources Board (CARB) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) certification of 2014 and 2015 dedicated-compressed natural gas fuel systems for its 6.0-liter GM engines for 14,000 lbs. and above GVWR trucks. We complete assembly (through the use of employees provided by CEE, LLC, an entity controlled by our president, George Gemayel) of the trucks and CNG fuel systems at its location in Santa Ana, CA. We use our strategic partner, CEE, LLC for the testing of its engines prior to applying for the CARB and EPA certifications referred to above. In addition, we used CEE, LLC and G&#38;K Automotive, another strategic partner, in connection with research and development activities. See &#8220;&#8212;Strategic Partners&#8221; below. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

Our customers include Ryder, Superior Transportation, AR Natural Gas Fueling systems, Propane distribution companies and others. We also had customers in vehicle sales that contributed to our sales in 2015. 

&#160; 

Funding for the incremental cost of the vehicles was provided by the California Energy Commission (CEC) and the Mobile Source for Pollution Reduction Review Committee. The CEC provides up to (i) $20,000 per vehicle that are up to 26,000 LBS GVWR and (ii) $26,000 per vehicle that are over 26,000 LBS GVWR. These funds are paid directly to us and taken in as deposits until actual delivery of the vehicles at which time it is deemed revenue. We have received $1.140 million from the CEC related to the sale of CNG and propane trucks. 

&#160; 

In addition, we have dealer relationships with each of (i) Superior Transportation for sales of CNG vehicles in Texas (ii) A.R. Natural Gas Fueling Systems for sales of our CNG vehicles in Pennsylvania. We are adding new dealers in 2016. We expect to deliver trucks to all our dealers in 2016. We have had discussions with other dealers throughout the United States and intend to enter into formal relationships with these dealers upon completion and assembly of additional truck inventory. There is no guarantee that we will enter into additional contracts or formal relationships with its current customers and additional dealers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

Convert Vehicles for Alternative Fuels 

&#160; 

In addition to our offering of new commercial trucks in alternative fuels, we can convert other existing vehicles (such as vehicles manufactured by Ford or GM that do not currently run on alternative fuels) to allow engines to run on CNG or LPG instead of gas or diesel. We have converted vehicles for other dealers including, without limitation, Tom&#8217;s Truck Center, Borhner Trucks, Rush Trucks and Rentals, and Thorson Motors. 

&#160; 

Suppliers 

&#160; 

We have supplier relationships with each of Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Company (JAC Motors), General Motors and Quantum Technologies for supply of the chassis, engine and CNG tanks, respectively. 

&#160; 

Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Company (JAC Motors)&#8212;Chassis 

&#160; 

In October 2012, Greenkraft entered into an agreement with JAC Motors, a Chinese Truck Chassis Manufacturer for the supply of its chassis and cabins. Greenkraft is entitled to use the JAC brand name for manufacturing and distribution of its trucks. The Agreement is for a term of 5-years and will automatically be renewed for an additional 5-years if the product targets are met. 

&#160; 

Greenkraft has relationships with other chassis suppliers. In the event that its relationship with JAC Motors was terminated, Greenkraft is confident that it could procure a relationship with an alternative chassis supplier on commercially reasonable terms. 

&#160; 

General Motors (GM)&#8212;Engines/Power Trains 

&#160; 

In October 2011, Greenkraft entered into an agreement with GM under which Greenkraft will have access to GM motors and power trains for insertion into their alternative fuel trucks. The agreement is for a 3-year term and expires on December 31, 2015. However this agreement was extended to December 31, 2017. Greenkraft has relationships with other suppliers of engines and power trains. In the event that Greenkraft&#8217;s agreement with GM is terminated, it is confident that it could execute agreements with other suppliers for its engines on commercially reasonable terms. 

&#160; 

Quantum Technologies&#8212;CNG tanks and tank assemblies 

&#160; 

In December 2012, Greenkraft entered into $2.5 million purchase order and summary of terms with Quantum Fuel Systems, Inc. under which Quantum agreed to supply Greenkraft with 250 Type 4 30 GGE CNG cylinder tanks including assembly. Greenkraft would be placing orders as needed for its trucks and conversions. Greenkraft would continue placing Purchase orders up to the 250 tank packages. 

&#160; 

Greenkraft obtains most components for the alternative fuel trucks from various suppliers as discussed above. In addition, the fuel systems are put together with different components from various suppliers. All components are either procured from suppliers or made specifically by suppliers for Greenkraft. Greenkraft does design certain components and brackets for use in its alternative fuel trucks and conversion systems and then contracts suppliers to make these items based on Greenkraft&#8217;s design and specification. 

&#160; 

Strategic Partners 

&#160; 

We have a strategic relationship with CEE, LLC, an emission laboratory of which George Gemayel is the managing member. CEE, LLC is recognized by EPA and CARB and has certified vehicles over 30 years. CEE has also provided its employees to Greenkraft for its truck assembly and conversion jobs with the salaries paid for by CEE which is reflected as a capital contribution to Greenkraft by Mr. Gemayel. Greenkraft does not have a written agreement with CEE LLC governing this relationship. In 2014, Greenkraft hired its employees directly for truck assembly. Greenkraft will continue to use CEE for testing of its engines to ensure CARB compliance. 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We also work with an automotive technical division in the automotive safety compliance industry. G&#38;K Automotive Conversion Inc. (&#8220;G&#38;K&#8221;). G&#38;K is a California based company founded in 1982 to modify and certify foreign motor vehicles to meet the stringent vehicle safety and emission standards of the United States. G&#38;K is certified as a Registered Importer (&#8220;RI&#8221;) by the Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;) and is certified as an Independent Commercial Importer (&#8220;ICI&#8221;) by the Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;). G&#38;K is also recognized by the California Air Resources board (&#8220;CARB&#8221;) as an approved motor vehicle modifier. G&#38;K is able to provide DOT, EPA, and CARB certification services at a full-service state-of-the-art facility in Santa Ana, California. Mr. George Gemayel is the president and controlling shareholder of G&#38;K. We do not have a written agreement with G&#38;K governing this relationship. 

&#160; 

Sales Distribution Strategy 

&#160; 

As discussed above, we already have distribution agreements in place with each of (i) Superior Transportation for sales of CNG and LPG vehicles in Texas and (ii) A.R. Natural Gas Fueling Systems for sales of our CNG vehicles in Pennsylvania. In the event that our relationship with either of these dealers terminated, we have relationships with other dealers that we can activate and believes we could enter into additional agreements on commercially reasonable terms. We intend to enter into distribution agreements with other dealers for other territories in the United States. We already had discussions with distributors in New York, New Jersey, California and Oregon for formal distribution relationships, which it intends to formalize upon reaching a critical mass of inventory of its alternative fuel trucks. We believe partnering with dealers for distribution of its trucks will have certain advantages such as, experienced trained sales force; service network, existing customer base and should also serve to reduce marketing costs. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we have 18 employees, including our executive officers George Gemayel and Sosi Bardakjian. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We believe that intellectual property protection will be important to our ability to successfully compete in the alternative fuel truck industry. We currently own all rights and patents associated with the Invention &#8220;LPG Fuel System&#8221; described under Application Number 61908022. This invention relates to the conversion of vehicles to run on LPG. We are currently in the process of recording a formal notice of assignment related to this invention with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. 

&#160; 

We intend to rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, certifications and trade secret laws and disclosure restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights. We intend to maintain a policy requiring our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and to control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. 

&#160; 

We will enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. 

&#160; 

We will aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We will pursue the registration of our trademarks, copyrights, and domain names in the U.S. and international jurisdictions. 

&#160; 

The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights. Competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technologies we employ in our services. Failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could significantly harm our competitive position and results of operations. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations 

&#160; 

California Energy Commission (CEC) 

&#160; 

The California Energy Commission is currently providing buy-downs related to the purchase of alternative fuel trucks to cover the incremental cost of purchasing alternative fuel vehicles. Greenkraft received $1,140,000 from the CEC of which (i) $400,000 was applied to the buy-down of 20 CNG vehicles of 16,000 lbs.; (ii) $340,000 was applied to the buy down of 17 CNG vehicles of 14,500 lbs. and (iii) $400,000 was applied to the buy down of 40 propane vehicles of 14,500 lbs. Greenkraft continues to apply for grants and more incentives that are available. 

&#160; 

California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority Tax Incentives 

&#160; 

We intend to apply for an arrangement with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority (CAEATFA) that could result in an exemption from California state sales and use taxes for sale of our trucks. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Credits 

&#160; 

In connection with the delivery and placement into service of our alternative fuel vehicles in the United Sates, we may be able to earn various tradable regulatory credits that can be sold to other manufacturers. 

&#160; 

Under the Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s (EPA) national greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards, vehicle manufacturers are required to meet fleet-wide average carbon dioxide emissions standards for cars and trucks at increasingly lower levels annually from 2012 &#8211; 2025. Those manufacturers whose fleet wide average fails to meet such standards have a deficit in their emission profile. Those manufacturers whose fleet wide average performs better than such standards may earn credits. Manufacturers may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who can apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. As a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles, we earn the full amount of GHG credits established by the standards on each vehicle sold. We have entered into agreements with another automobile manufacturer to sell the credits that we earn. 

&#160; 

We may enter into contracts for the sale of credits with several automotive manufacturers, if and when such credits are earned by us. 

&#160; 

Regulation&#8212;EPA Emissions &#38; Certificate of Conformity 

&#160; 

Our products are sold to commercial users. Our alternative fuel engines are subject to approval for the U.S. EPA as well as state agencies such as the CARB. We have received Certificates of Conformity from the EPA for our natural gas engines that go into vehicles (in excess of 14,000 lbs.) in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. In addition the CARB has issued executive orders for 4.8 liter, and 6.0 liter CNG engines in 2012 and 6.0 liter propane engines in 2015 and 6.0 liter and 6.8 liter CNG engines in 2014 and 2015. For 2015, Greenkraft also applied for 6.0 liter and 8.0 liter GM and Ford Fuel delivery system certifications with EPA and CARB. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Competition in the automotive industry is intense and evolving. We believe the impact of new regulatory requirements for vehicle emissions, technological advances in powertrain and shifting customer needs and expectations are causing the industry to evolve in the direction alternative fuel vehicles. We believe the primary competitive factors in our markets include but are not limited to: 

&#160; 

&#183; product quality and safety; &#183; service options; &#183; product performance; &#183; product price; and &#183; manufacturing efficiency. &#160; 

The worldwide automotive market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition, almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively.
