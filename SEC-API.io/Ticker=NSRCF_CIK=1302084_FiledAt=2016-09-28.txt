 ITEM 1. &#8211; BUSINESS

Cautionary Note

Based on the nature of our business, we anticipate incurring operating losses for the foreseeable future. We base this expectation, in part, on the fact that very few mineral properties in the exploration stage are ultimately developed into producing and profitable mines. Our future financial results are uncertain due to a number of factors, some of which are outside the Company&#8217;s control. These factors include, but are not limited to: (1) our ability to raise additional funding; (2) the market price for graphite and vanadium; (3) the results of the exploration programs and metallurgical analysis of our mineral properties; (4) the political instability and/or environmental regulations that may adversely impact costs and ability to operate in Madagascar; and (5) our ability to find joint venture and/or off-take partners in order to advance the development of our mineral properties.

Any future equity financing will cause existing shareholders to experience dilution of their ownership interest in the Company. In the event the Company is not successful in raising additional financing, we anticipate the Company will not be able to proceed with its existing business plan. In such a case, the Company may decide to discontinue or modify its business plan and seek other business opportunities in the resource sector.

During this period, the Company will need to maintain periodic filings with the appropriate regulatory authorities and will incur legal, accounting, administrative and exchange listing costs. In the event no other such opportunities are available and the Company cannot raise additional funding to sustain operations, the Company may be forced to discontinue the business. The Company does not have any specific alternative business opportunities under consideration and has not planned for any such contingency.

Due to accumulated losses and present inability to generate revenues, the Company auditors have stated in their opinion in the footnotes to our audited financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K and the Company has included in Note 1 of this financial statements that there currently exists doubt as to the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.

BACKGROUND &#8211; COMPANY OVERVIEW

We are incorporated in the State of Minnesota, USA and have a fiscal year end of June 30. We were originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 1, 2004 and reincorporated in the State of Minnesota on May 14, 2008. Our principal business is the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral resources. We have not generated operating revenues or paid dividends since inception on March 1, 2004 to the period ended June 30, 2016 and we are unlikely to do so in the immediate or foreseeable future. Our business activities have been entirely financed from the proceeds of securities subscriptions.

During fiscal 2008, we incorporated Energizer Resources (Mauritius) Ltd. (&#8220;ERMAU&#8221;), a Mauritius subsidiary, and Energizer Resources Madagascar Sarl. (&#8220;ERMAD&#8221;), a Madagascar subsidiary of ERMAU. During fiscal 2009, the Company incorporated THB Ventures Ltd. (&#8220;THB&#8221;), a Mauritius subsidiary of ERMAU, and Energizer Resources Minerals Sarl. (&#8220;ERMIN&#8221;), a Madagascar subsidiary of THB, which holds the 100% ownership interest of the Green Giant Property in Madagascar (see note 7). During fiscal 2012, the Company incorporated Madagascar&#8209;ERG Joint Venture (Mauritius) Ltd. (&#8220;ERGJVM&#8221;), a Mauritius subsidiary of ERMAU, and ERG (Madagascar) Sarl. (&#8220;ERGMAD&#8221;), a Madagascar subsidiary of ERGJVM, which holds the Malagasy Joint Venture Ground. During fiscal 2014, the Company incorporated 2391938 Ontario Inc., an Ontario, Canada subsidiary.

On December 16, 2014, our authorized capital was increased from an aggregate of four hundred fifty million (450,000,000) shares to six hundred fifty million (650,000,000) shares, with a par value of $0.001 per share, of which 640,000,000 will be deemed common shares and the remaining 10,000,000 will be deemed eligible to be divisible into classes, series and types with rights and preferences as designated by our Board of Directors. 

&#160;

We have not had any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding since incorporation. Except as described below, there have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations or purchases or sales of any significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business since the date of incorporation.

Summary of Our Business

We are an exploration stage company primarily engaged in the advancement of the Molo Graphite Project, consisting of a commercially minable graphite deposit situated in the African country of Madagascar. &#160; We have additional exploration stage properties situated in Madagascar and in the Province of Qu&#233;bec, Canada.

Our executive offices are situated at 520&#8211;141 Adelaide Street West, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5H 3L5 and the primary telephone number is (416) 364-7024. Our website is www.energizerresources.com (which website is expressly not incorporated by reference into this filing).

Further details regarding each of our Madagascar properties, although not incorporated by reference, including the comprehensive geological report prepared in accordance Canada&#8217;s National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Properties (&#8220;NI 43-101&#8221;) for the Molo Graphite Property and separately the technical report on the Green Giant Property in Madagascar can be found on the Company&#8217;s website at www.energizerresources.com (which website is expressly not incorporated by reference into this filing) or in the Company&#8217;s Canadian regulatory filings at www.sedar.com &#160; (which website and content is expressly not incorporated by reference into this filing). We report mineral reserve estimates in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s Industry Guide 7 (&#8220;Guide 7&#8221;) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;U.S. Securities Act&#8221;). As a reporting issuer in Canada with our primary trading market in Canada, we are also required to prepare reports on our mineral properties in accordance with NI 43-101. The technical reports referenced in this document uses the terms &#8220;mineral resource,&#8221; &#8220;measured mineral resource,&#8221; &#8220;indicated mineral resource&#8221; and &#8220;inferred mineral resource&#8221;. These terms are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101; however, these terms are not defined terms under Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, information in respect of our resources determined in accordance with NI 43-101 are not contained in this document. 

Summary of Milestones

We are pursuing negotiations in respect of potential off-take agreements with graphite end-users and intermediaries with the intention of securing project financing alternatives, which may include debt, equity and derivative instruments. Discussions in respect of these matters have been ongoing for the past 24 months and are expected to continue during the coming months with no assurances as to the conclusion or results of these discussions.

In July 2016, we appointed UK-based HCF International Advisers Limited ("HCF") as advisor in negotiating and structuring strategic partnerships, off take agreements and debt financing for its Molo Graphite project.

In August 2016, we initiated a Front End Engineering Design Study (the &#8220;FEED Study&#8221;) for the Company's Molo graphite project in Madagascar. The FEED Study is being undertaken in order to determine potential development path options that have been presented to the Company by prospective strategic partners.

Our management continues to assess project optimization strategies with the intention of reducing the capital and operating costs relating to the Molo Graphite Property with no assurances as to the conclusion and results of these assessments.

Future Plans

With the completion of the Molo Feasibility Study, potential financiers and strategic partners have been approached, and the Company is seeking funding for the development of the Molo Deposit into a mine. In parallel, the Company has initiated a FEED Study, which is anticipated to continue through to the end of October, 2016.

From the date of this annual report, and subject to availability of capital, our plan is to incur between $250,000 and $13,250,000 on further engineering, exploration, testing and permitting to advance the Molo Graphite Property and on the potential creation of a pilot plant, subject to the availability of capital and any other unforeseen delays, by June 30, 2017. No assurances can be provided that we will achieve our objective by that date.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The following is a summary of the amounts budgeted to be incurred (presuming all $13,500,000 is required):

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

The above amounts may be revised based on actual costs and the timing may be delayed based on several factors, including the availability of capital to fund the budget. We anticipate that the source of funds required to complete the budgeted items disclosed above will come from private placements in the capital markets, &#160; but there can be no assurance that financing will be available on terms favorable to the Company or at all.

Although no assurances can be provided, the FEED Study is currently ongoing and is anticipated to continue through to the end of October 2016. This will be followed by a decision to pursue a bulk sample and/or the construction of a pilot plant.

Other Expenses

Management anticipates spending approximately $250,000 - $450,000 in ongoing general office and administration expenses and professional fees per quarter for the next twelve months. Expenses will vary in direct proportion with the level of activity relating to future acquisitions and exploration programs.

Employees

As of the date of this annual report, we have 3 full-time employees and in addition, we engage several consultants to serve important managerial and non-managerial functions.

Competitive Conditions in our Industry

The mineral exploration and mining industry is competitive in all phases of exploration, development and production. We compete with a number of other entities and individuals in the search for, and acquisition of, attractive mineral properties. As a result of this competition, the majority of which is with companies with greater financial resources than us, we may not in the future be able to acquire attractive properties on terms our management considers acceptable. Furthermore, we compete with other resource companies, many of whom have greater financial resources and/or more advanced properties that are better able to attract equity investments and other capital. Factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of minerals mined or discovered by us.

&#160;

&#160;

Mineral Properties

Cautionary Note Regarding Resource and Reserve Calculation &#8211; We report mineral reserve estimates in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) Industry Guide 7 (&#8220;Guide 7&#8221;) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;U.S. Securities Act&#8221;). As a reporting issuer in Canada with our primary trading market in Canada, we are also required to prepare reports on our mineral properties in accordance with NI 43-101. The technical reports referenced in this document uses the terms &#8220;mineral resource,&#8221; &#8220;measured mineral resource,&#8221; &#8220;indicated mineral resource&#8221; and &#8220;inferred mineral resource&#8221;. We advise investors that these terms are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101; however, these terms are not defined terms under Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports filed with the SEC. As a result, information in respect of our resources determined in accordance with NI 43-101 are not contained in this document. We reference these reports in this document for informational purposes only and such reports are not incorporated herein by reference. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in the above categories will ever be converted into Guide 7 compliant reserves. &#8220;Inferred mineral resources&#8221; have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of &#8220;contained&#8221; minerals in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute &#8220;reserves&#8221; by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Canadian investors should review the Molo Graphite Project Feasibility Study (and the other technical reports filed by the Company, with the securities regulators in Canada), including the mineral resource estimates (which are not permitted to be disclosed under Industry Guide 7) for further details regarding our material mineral properties.

As used in this document, the terms &#8220;mineral reserve&#8221;, &#8220;proven mineral reserve&#8221; and &#8220;probable mineral reserve&#8221; are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101 and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the &#8220;CIM&#8221;)&#8212;CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended. These definitions differ from the definitions in Guide 7. Under Guide 7 standards, a &#8220;final&#8221; or &#8220;bankable&#8221; feasibility study is required to report reserves, the three-year historical average price is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority. The reserves disclosed in this document also comply with the requirements of Guide 7.

Proven and probable reserves are based on extensive drilling, sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from which we determined economic feasibility. The term &#8220;proven reserves&#8221; means mineral reserves for which (i) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (ii) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (iii) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. The term &#8220;probable reserves&#8221; means mineral reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including grade, metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used.

The proven and probable reserve figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of minerals will be realized. Minerals included in the proven and probable reserves are those contained prior to losses during metallurgical treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of minerals, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain proven and probable reserves containing lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves

Mr. Craig Scherba, President and CEO of the Company, is designated as the &#8220;qualified person&#8221; who reviewed and approved the technical disclosure contained in this document.

&#160;

Molo Graphite Project, Southern Madagascar, Africa

On December 14, 2011, we entered into a Definitive Joint Venture Agreement ("JVA") with Malagasy Minerals Limited ("Malagasy"), a public company on the Australian Stock Exchange, to acquire a 75% interest to explore and develop a group of industrial minerals, including graphite, vanadium and approximately 25 other minerals. The land position covers 2,119 permits and 827.7 square kilometres and is mostly adjacent to the south and east of the Company's 100% owned Green Giant Property. We paid $2,261,690 and issued 7,500,000 common shares valued at $1,350,000.

&#160;

&#160;

On April 16, 2014, we signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement and a Mineral Rights Agreement with Malagasy to acquire the remaining 25% interest. We made the following payments at that time: $364,480 (CAD$400,000); issued 2,500,000 common shares subject to a 12 month voluntary vesting period and valued at $325,000; and issued 3,500,000 common share purchase warrants, valued at $320,950 using the Black Scholes pricing model with an exercise price of $0.14 and an expiry date of April 15, 2019.

On May 20, 2015 we paid $546,000 (CAD$700,000), and issued 1,000,000 common shares due to the completion of a bankable feasibility study (&#8220;BFS&#8221;) for the Molo Graphite Property. Further, a cash payment of $801,584 (CAD$1,000,000) will be due within five days of the commencement of commercial production. Malagasy retains a 1.5% net smelter return royalty ("NSR") on the property. We also acquired a 100% interest to the industrial mineral rights on approximately 1 1/2 additional claim blocks comprising 10,811 hectares to the east and adjoining the Molo Graphite Property.

&#160;

The following is the extracted summary section from the Feasibility Study prepared by Dr. John Hancox, PhD. Geology, Pri.Sc.Nat, Mr. Desmond Subramani, B.Sc. Honours Geology, Pri.Sc.Nat, Dave Thompson, B.Tech Mining, Pr.Cert.Eng, Oliver Peters, M.Sc. Mineral Processing, Pr.Eng, Doug Heher, B.Sc. Mechanical Engineering, Pr.Eng, and John Stanbury, B.Sc. Industrial Engineering, Pr.Eng, each of whom is a &#8220;qualified person&#8221; and &#8220;independent&#8221;, as such terms are defined in NI 43-101. The following summary does not purport to be a complete summary of the Molo Graphite Project and is subject to all the assumptions, qualifications and procedures set out in the Feasibility Study and is qualified in its entirety with reference to the full text of the Feasibility Study. It is advised that this summary should be read in conjunction with the Feasibility Study (which is not incorporated by reference into this filing).

The summary includes an important modification from the original Feasibility Study, whereby the project&#8217;s economic indicators are now presented under two scenarios with equal prominence: (i) using the historical three-year average graphite price (not included in the Feasibility Study), and (ii) using a projected and escalating graphite basket price (as per the Feasibility Study).

Introduction

&#160;

The Molo deposit is situated 160 kilometres (&#8220; km &#8221;) southeast of the city of Toliara, in the Tulear region of south-western Madagascar. The deposit occurs in a sparsely populated, dry savannah grassland region, which has easy access via a network of seasonal secondary roads radiating outward from the village of Fotadrevo. Fotadrevo in turn has an all-weather airstrip and access to a road system that leads to the regional capital (and port city) of Toliara and the Port of Ehoala at Fort Dauphin via the RN10, or RN13.

Geologically Molo is situated in the Bekikiy block (Tolagnaro-Ampanihy high grade metamorphic province) of southern Madagascar. The Molo deposit is underlain predominantly by moderately to highly metamorphosed and sheared graphitic (biotite, chlorite and garnet-rich) quartzo-feldspathic schists and gneisses, which are variably mineralised. Near surface rocks are oxidised, and saprolitic to a depth, usually of less than 5m.

Molo is one of several surficial graphite trends discovered by Energizer in late 2011 and announced in early January 2012. The deposit was originally drill tested in 2012, with an initial seven holes being completed. Resource delineation, drilling and trenching on Molo took place between May and November of 2012, and allowed for a maiden Indicated and Inferred Resource to be stated in early December of the same year. This maiden mineral resource estimate formed the basis for a Preliminary Economic Assessment (the &#8220; PEA &#8221;), which was undertaken by DRA Mineral Projects in 2013.

The positive outcome of this assessment lead Energizer to undertake another phase of exploratory drilling and sampling in 2014, which was done under the supervision of Caracle Creek International Consulting (Pty) Limited (&#8220; Caracle Creek &#8221; or &#8220; CCIC &#8221;). This phase of exploration was aimed at improving the geological confidence of the deposit and its contained mineral resources, and included an additional 32 diamond drill holes (totalling 2,063 metres) and 9 trenches (totalling 1,876 metres). Caracle Creek were subsequently engaged to update the geological model and resource estimate. The entire database on which this new model and resource estimate is based contains 80 drill holes (totalling 11,660 metres) and 35 trenches (totalling 8,492 metres). This new resource forms the basis for this Molo 2015 FS.

&#160;

Project Location

&#160;

The Molo deposit is located some 160 km SE of Madagascar&#8217;s administrative capital (and port city) of Toliara, in the Tulear region and about 220 km NW of Fort Dauphin. It is approximately 13 km NE of the local village of Fotadrevo. See Figure 1 below.

Project Description

&#160;

The proposed development of the Molo Graphite Project includes the construction of a green fields open pit mine, a processing plant with a capacity of 862,000 tonnes of ore per annum and all supporting infrastructure including water, fuel, power, tailings, buildings and permanent accommodation.

The mine will utilize four 2 megawatt diesel generators, with three running and one standby and water is supplied from a well field which has been defined by drilling and detailed geo-hydrological modelling. The processing plant will consist of conventional crushing, milling and flotation circuits followed by concentrate filtering, drying and screening. The waste heat generated by the power station will be utilized for the drying of the concentrate.

The tailings storage facility, in the form of a valley dam layout, is located approximately 1.5 kilometers to the west of the process plant and is designed to accommodate the run-of-mine tonnage for the 26 year Life of Mine (&#8220; LOM &#8221;).

See Figure 2 below for the proposed layout of the site.

Property Description and Ownership

&#160;

Property description

The Molo Graphite Project is contained in a portion of Exploration Permit #3432. The Project is centred on UTM coordinates 413,390 Easting 7,345,713 Northing (UTM 38S, WGS 84 datum). The Molo Graphite Project is located 11.5 km ENE of the town of Fotadrevo and covers an area of 62.5 hectares (&#8220; ha &#8221;). The Government of Madagascar designates individual claims by a central LaBorde UTM location point, comprising a square with an area of 6.25 km 2 .

Ownership

On December 14, 2011, the Company entered into a Definitive Joint Venture Agreement (&#8220; JVA &#8221;) with Malagasy Minerals Limited (&#8220;Malagasy&#8221;), a public company on the Australian Stock Exchange, to acquire a 75% interest to explore and develop a group of industrial minerals, including graphite, vanadium and approximately 25 other minerals. On October 24, 2013, the Company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (&#8220; MOU &#8221;) with Malagasy to acquire the remaining 25% interest in the land position. On April 16, 2014, Energizer signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement and a Mineral Rights Agreement with Malagasy to acquire the remaining 25% interest. Malagasy retained a 1.5% net smelter return royalty (&#8220; NSR &#8221;).

The Molo Graphite Project is located within Exploration Permit #3432 as issued by the Bureau de Cadastre Minier de Madagascar pursuant to the Mining Code 1999 (as amended) and its implementing decrees.

CCIC has reviewed a copy of the Contrat d&#8217;amodiation pertaining to this right and are satisfied that the rights to explore this permit have been ceded to Energizer or one of its Madagascar subsidiaries.

Energizer holds the exclusive right to explore for a defined group of industrial minerals within the permits listed above. These industrial minerals include the following: Graphite, Vanadium, Lithium, Aggregates, Alunite, Barite, Bentonite, Vermiculite, Carbonatites, Corundum, Dimensional stone (excluding labradorite), Feldspar (excluding labradorite), Fluorspar, Granite, Gypsum, Kaolin, Kyanite, Limestone / Dolomite, Marble, Mica, Olivine, Perlite, Phosphate, Potash- Potassium minerals, Pumice Quartz, Staurolite, and Zeolites.

Reporting requirements of exploration activities carried out by the titleholder on a Research Permit are minimal. A titleholder must maintain a diary of events and record the names and dates present of persons active on the project. In addition, a site plan with a scale between 1/100 and 1/10,000 showing &#8220;a map of the work completed&#8221; must be presented. Upon establishment of a mineral resource, Research Permits may be converted into Exploitation Permits by application. CCIC is of the opinion that Energizer is compliant in terms of its commitments under these reporting requirements.

The Molo Graphite Project has not been legally surveyed; however, since all claim boundaries conform to the predetermined rectilinear LaBorde Projection grid, these can be readily located on the ground by use of Global Positioning System (&#8220; GPS &#8221;) instruments. Most current GPS units and software packages do not however offer LaBorde among their available options, and therefore defined shifts have to be employed to display LaBorde data in the WGS 84 system. For convenience, all Energizer positional data is collected in WGS 84, and if necessary converted back to LaBorde.

Royalties

There is a 1.5% net smelter return royalty on the Molo Graphite Project.

Permits

Exploration Permit #3432 is currently held under the name of a subsidiary of Malagasy Minerals called, Mada-Aust Sarl. The transformation or amendment of exploration and research mining permits within the country continues to be suspended from the time that Madagascar was run by a president who was not democratically elected. This current permit expired on August 17, 2011.

Energizer&#8217;s Madagascar domiciled subsidiary companies and Mada-Aust Sarl has continued to pay all taxes and administrative fees to the Madagascan government and its mining ministry with respect to all the mining permits held in country. These taxes and administrative fee payments have been acknowledged and accepted by the Madagascan government. In addition, Energizer management continues to diligently work with the Madagascan government to obtain the necessary permits in its name as the country clears its backlog of applications and amendments.

&#160;

&#160;

The research permit will be converted into an exploitation permit in due course. When the permit is transformed from a research permit to an exploitation permit, the exploitation permit will be issued in the name of Energizer. The exploitation permit is required to advance the Molo Graphite Project to the developmental stage.

Exploration

&#160;

No further exploration is currently planned.

Metallurgical Test Work

&#160;

The Molo 2015 FS is based on a full suite of metallurgical test work performed by SGS Canada Metallurgical Services Inc. (&#8220; SGS &#8221;) which is based in Lakefield, Ontario, Canada. These tests included laboratory scale metallurgical work and a 200 tonne bulk sample / pilot plant program. The laboratory scale work included comminution tests, process development and optimization tests, variability flotation, and concentrate upgrading tests.

Comminution test results place the Molo ore into the very soft to soft category with low abrasivity. A simple reagent regime consists of fuel oil number 2 and methyl isobutyl carbinol at dosages of approximately 120 g/t and 195 g/t, respectively. A total of approximately 150 open circuit and locked cycle flotation tests were completed on almost 70 composites as part of the process development, optimization, and variability flotation program. The metallurgical programs culminated in a process flowsheet that is capable of treating the Molo ore using proven mineral processing techniques and extraction has been successfully demonstrated in the laboratory and pilot plant campaigns.

The tests indicated that variability exists with regards to the metallurgical response of the ore across the deposit, which resulted in a range of concentrate grades between 88.8% total carbon and 97.8% total carbon. Optical mineralogy on representative concentrate samples identified interlayered graphite and non- sulphide gangue minerals as the primary source of impurities. The process risk was mitigated with the design of an upgrading circuit, which improved the grade of a concentrate representing the average mill product of the first five years of operation from 92.1% total carbon to 97.1% total carbon.

The overall graphitic carbon recovery into the final concentrate of the first 5 years of operation is 87.8% based on the metallurgical response of composites using samples from all drill holes within the five year pit design. The average composition of the combined concentrate grade is presented in the table below.

The area composites were generated by splitting the footprint of the five year mine plan into five zones of approximately the same size. All drill holes within one specific zone were then combined to form an area composite. A total of fifteen area composites were generated for metallurgical evaluation, (five zones with three depth intervals per zone). All assays were completed using control quality analysis and cross checks were completed during the mass balancing process to verify that the results were within the estimated measurement uncertainly of up to 1.7% relative for graphite concentrate grades greater than 90% total carbon.

Vendor testing including solid-liquid separation of tailings and concentrate, screening and dewatering of concentrate, and drying of concentrate was completed successfully.

1.10 &#160; Recovery methods 

&#160;

The process design is based on an annual production capacity of 862 kilotonnes of plant feed material at a nominal head grade of 7.04% C(t) producing an estimated average of 53 kilotonnes per annum (&#8220; ktpa &#8221;) of final concentrate.

The ore processing circuit consists of three-stage crushing followed by primary milling and classification, a flotation separation and concentrate upgrading circuit, and graphite product and tailings effluent handling facilities.

The crushing circuit is designed to operate 365 days per annum for 24 hours per day at &#177;68% utilization and comprises a primary jaw crusher, a secondary cone crusher and a tertiary cone crusher in closed-circuit with a double-deck classifying screen. The crushed product (P80 of approximately 13 mm) passes through a surge bin from where it is fed to the milling circuit.

The milling and flotation circuits are designed to operate 365 days per annum for 24 hours per day at 91% utilization. A single stage primary ball milling circuit is employed, incorporating a closed circuit linear classifying screen and a scalping screen ahead of the mill. The scalping screen undersize feeds a single flash flotation cell before combining with the mill discharge material. Scalping and linear screen oversize are the feed to the primary mill. The primary ball mill size is 4.3m diameter (inside new liners) x 4.6m (EGL) with an installed motor power of 1000 kW.

Primary milling is followed by rougher flotation which, along with flash flotation, recovers the graphite to concentrate from the main stream. Rougher flotation employs seven forced-draught trough cells.

The primary, fine-flake and attritioning cleaning circuits upgrade the concentrate to the final product grade of above 94% C(t). Concentrate from the main stream feeds into the primary cleaning circuit consisting essentially of a dewatering screen, a polishing ball mill, a column flotation cell and flotation cleaner/cleaner scavenger trough cells.

The primary cleaner column cell concentrate gravitates to a 65 mesh classifying screen, from where the large-flake oversize is directed to a high rate thickener located ahead of a final concentrate attritioning circuit. Primary cleaner classifying screen undersize is pumped to the fine-flake cleaning circuit.

The fine flake cleaning circuit consists primarily of a dewatering screen, a polishing ball mill, a column flotation cell and flotation cleaner/cleaner scavenger trough cells. The attritioning cleaning circuit employs a high rate thickener, an attritioning stirred mill, a column flotation cell and flotation cleaner/cleaner scavenger trough cells. Fine flake column concentrate merges with the +65 mesh primary cleaner classifying screen oversize as it feeds the attritioning circuit thickener. Attritioning circuit column concentrate comprises the final concentrate stream feeding the final concentrate thickener.

&#160;

&#160;

Combined rougher and cleaner flotation final tailings are pumped to a guard de- gritting cyclone installation ahead of a high rate final tailings thickener. Cyclone overflow feeds the thickener. Cyclone and thickener underflows combine and are pumped for final disposal to the tailings storage facility (&#8220; TSF &#8221;).

Thickened final concentrate is pumped to a linear vacuum belt filter for further dewatering before the filter cake is fed into a rotary kiln drying circuit.

A three-stage, twin stream sifting plant screens the dry concentrate (dryer product) into the pre-determined size classes. A bagging plant is employed to weigh, sample and bag the different size fractions discretely for loading into sea freight containers for shipment.

Chemical reagents are used throughout the primary recovery and upgrading processes. Diesel fuel collector and liquid frother are added to various points-of- use within the flotation circuits.

Diesel collector is pumped from the main tank farm to a bulk tank at the plant, from where it enters a manifold system which supplies multiple variable speed peristaltic pumps which discretely pump the collector at set rates to the various points-of-use within the flotation circuits.

MIBC (methyl isobutyl carbinol) frother is delivered by road to a plant reagent store in 1m 3 IBC&#8217;s, or 210 litre steel drums. The drums are collected by forklift as required and the contents pumped into a frother storage tank. A manifold system on the storage tank supplies multiple variable speed peristaltic pumps, which discretely pump the frother at set rates to the various points-of-use within the flotation circuits.

Flocculant powder (Magnafloc 919 and Magnafloc 24 for concentrate and tailings thickening facilitation respectively) is delivered by road to the plant reagent store in 25 kg bags. The bags are collected by forklift as required and delivered to a flocculant mixing and dosing area. Here the flocculant is diluted as required using parallel, duplicate vendor-package automated make-up plants, one each being dedicated to supplying the concentrate and tailings thickeners due to the flocculant types required being different for each application. Variable speed peristaltic pumps discretely pump the flocculant at set rates to the thickeners&#8217; points-of-use.

Coagulant powder (Magnafloc 1707) for thickening enhancement is handled similarly to the flocculant as described above, the exception being that a single make-up system is provided to supply both the concentrate and tailings thickeners. Again, variable speed peristaltic pumps discretely pump the coagulant at set rates to the thickeners&#8217; points-of-use.

Infrastructure

&#160;

The project is located in a relatively remote part of South Western Madagascar, approximately 13 km NE of the local village of Fotadrevo. There is currently no infrastructure on site and everything will have to be constructed.

&#160;

The following elements are all part of the project scope:

&#160;

&#183; Raw water supply (from a network of bore holes extracting ground water) 

&#183; Power supply (temporary during construction) and then a permanent diesel power station to supply the plant and permanent camp 

&#183; Sanitation for the plant, permanent camp, and temporary during construction) 

&#183; Storm water control and management 

&#183; Temporary accommodation during construction 

&#183; Permanent accommodation (340 people) 

&#183; All permanent buildings (offices, workshops, stores, laboratory) 

&#183; All buried services (potable water, sewage, stormwater, electrical reticulation) 

&#183; In plant roads 

&#183; Haul road 

&#183; Tailings Storage Facility 

&#183; Tailings pipe line to the TSF 

&#183; Return water pipe line from the TSF back to the plant 

&#183; Rock dumps and Run of Mine Ore (&#8220; ROM &#8221;) pads 

See Figure 2 in section 1.3 for the site layout.

&#160;

Raw Water Supply

Water is supplied by a network of boreholes. A detailed water demand and supply analysis was done as part of the Molo 2015 FS, and this has shown that the water demands of the plant can be accommodated by boreholes within a radius of 5km from the plant. The daily steady state raw water make up requirement is estimated to be 561m 3 per day.

Power Supply

Power is supplied by four 2 MW diesel generators. The running load for the plant is estimated to be 2.7 MW with an additional 0.8 MW for the permanent camp and all mine infrastructure. Under normal operation there will only be two units running, with a third allowed to assist with mill starting, and the fourth unit as a spare for maintenance.

1.12 &#160; Product Pricing 

&#160;

Graphite prices are based on current quotes and projected estimates provided by UK-based Roskill Consulting Group Ltd (&#8220; Roskill &#8221;), recognized as a leader in providing independent and unbiased market research, pricing trends, and demand and supply analysis for the natural flake graphite market.

The historical 3 year average price in December 2014 was $1,867 per tonne. The weighted average price per tonne of graphite concentrate in December 2014 was US$1,375 per tonne. This is a basket price and reflects the contribution of the different flake sizes and carbon grades to the overall price.

The start-up price (in 2017 terms) for a tonne of Molo graphite concentrate is a projection based on Roskill information using the weighted average price per tonne. The graphite price then escalates in the financial model based on Roskill&#8217;s forecasts for supply and demand. The reader is cautioned that these are forecasts and may change subject to market dynamics.

&#160;

&#160;

1.13 &#160; Logistics 

&#160;

The cost to transport one tonne of dry concentrate (0.5% moisture content) from Molo to Rotterdam via Fort Dauphin, Madagascar, in December 2014 terms is 337 US$ / tonne. This is based on shipping 26 tonnes of concentrate in 1 m3 bags placed inside a 40 ft. container.

The route from Molo to Fort Dauphin runs either via the RN 10 or the RN 13. Both these routes vary from reasonable to poor condition and trucks are expected to take between four and five days to make the round trip. A truck was run over the route by a Madagascan trucking contractor to gauge cycle times and they managed to complete the journey in two long days each way. This was in the dry season and in the wet season there may be periods of time when the roads become impassable. No money has been budgeted for roads repairs or upgrades.

The Port of Ehoala at Fort Dauphin is a modern (2009) port developed by Rio Tinto for the QMM project. It has a 15m draft with shipping lines calling on a regular basis. There are however no crane facilities and vessels require their own cranes.

Figure 5 below shows a picture of the Port of Ehoala at Fort Dauphin.

1.14 &#160; Capital costs 

&#160;

The capital cost for the project is estimated to be 188.2 million US$, including a contingency of 24.5 million US$. Competitive bids were obtained for most mechanical equipment, and for the earthworks, civils, structural steel, mechanical erection, piping and electrical, control and instrumentation detailed Bills of Quantities were issued for competitive pricing.

The base date for the capital costs is December 2014 and no provision has been made for escalation. The accuracy of capital costs is considered to be with +/- 10%

&#160;

Future capital expenditure expected to be incurred has been allowed for in the financial model to cover the expansion of the TSF in year 2, the replacement of the mine fleet, the replacement of the power plant, and for rehabilitation at the end of the project. Over the life of mine this accounts for an additional 38.3 million US$ with 7 million US$ spent on the TSF expansion in year 2.

&#160;

&#160;

1.15 &#160; Operating costs 

&#160;

The average cash operating costs from year 3 onwards, after the expatriate staff complement is reduced, are estimated to be 21.7 US$ per mineralized tonne processed and 353 US$ per tonne of concentrate produced. The cash operating costs includes mine operations (owner operated), process plant operations and general and administrative charges. They do not include shipping from Molo to the end user, or any downstream processing costs.

The operating costs expressed above are considered to be accurate to +/- 10%, and assume a varying US$ inflation rate of 1.6% in 2015 and escalating to 2.0% from 2017 onward. Currency inflation rates were also considered in the financial model and were applied to the South African Rand and Malagasy Ariary portions of the opex costs.

&#160;

Please note that these operating costs assume that the plant is able to successfully handle the variability in the ore body, as shown by the SGS test work discussed in detail in Section 13. Should the plant not perform as expected this could have a material impact on operating costs as:

&#160;

&#8226; &#160; The flake size distribution could be worse than expected 

&#8226; &#160; The product grade could be lower than expected 

&#8226; &#160; The recoveries could be lower than expected or a combination of all of these

1.17 &#160; Environmental &#38; Permitting 

&#160;

A comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (&#8220; ESIA &#8221;) was completed to local Malagasy, Equator Principles, Word Bank and International Finance Corporation (&#8220; IFC &#8221;) standards. The process was preceded by an Environmental Legal Review and an Environmental and Social Screening Assessment; both providing crucial information to align the project development and design with international best practice on sustainable project development.

The ESIA submission is subject to approval of the investment amount by Madagascar&#8217;s Ministry of Mines. The application was submitted on 30th January 2015 and the approval of the investment amount is in progress. Energizer will receive a Global Environmental Permit upon approval of the ESIA, a process which is expected to take six months from date of submission.

A comprehensive permitting register is in place and additional sectorial permit applications will form part of the early execution phase. Approval of the sectorial applications is expected within the same six month period as the ESIA review.

No material issues were identified in relation to Environmental, Social and Permitting processes and through the stakeholder engagement process the local and regional community has expressed a desire for the project to move forward.

1.18 &#160; Conclusions 

&#160;

1.18.1 &#160; Geology 

Energizer&#8217;s 2011 exploration program delineated a number of new graphitic trends in southern Madagascar. The resource delineation drilling undertaken during 2012-2014 focused on only one of these, the Molo deposit, and this has allowed for an independent, updated resource statement for the Molo deposit, which is stated in accordance with the CIM Guidelines.

1.18.2 &#160; Mining 

Maiden mineral reserves of 22 437 000 tonnes have been declared for the Molo Graphite Project at an average grade of 7.02% and based on the information contained in the Molo 2015 FS it is possible to economically mine this deposit.

1.18.3 &#160; Metallurgical Test Work 

Comprehensive metallurgical test programs culminated in a process flowsheet that is capable of treating the Molo ore using conventional and established mineral processing techniques. Process risks associated with the variability with regards to metallurgical performance have been mostly mitigated through the addition of an upgrading circuit.

1.18.4 &#160; Recovery Methods 

The laboratory, pilot and vendor test work conducted prior to and during the study defined the required process flow sheet. This was duly translated into a full-scale production plant flow sheet as described within this report. The flow sheet unit processes were populated and individual component equipment selected according to either pilot plant precedents or, where these were not available, proven practice within the industry, in conjunction with suitably experienced vendors. All process designs and selections were based on conventional, proven mineral processing practices.

The processing selections and configurations built into the design are adequately suited to the requirements. Based on the mining and metallurgical test work information presented elsewhere within the Molo 2015 FS, and assuming within specification ROM ore is fed to the plant, the required recovery is expected to be attainable at the throughput stated. Note that this recovery is based on lab and pilot scale test work and may reduce slightly on a full scale plant due to operational inefficiencies. This possible reduction has not been taken into account in the financial analysis.

1.18.5 &#160; Infrastructure 

All infrastructure required for the project has to be installed from scratch and has been allowed for in the project budget.

1.18.6 &#160; Water 

The detailed hydrogeological analysis has concluded that the plant can be supplied from a well field.

&#160;

1.18.7 &#160; Environmental, Social 

A comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment has been done, and is in the process of being submitted to Madagascan government for approval.

1.18.8 &#160; Permitting 

Various permits will have to be obtained for the project including an Environmental Permit and a Mining permit. The most urgent permit is for Energizer to renew the exploration permit covering the project.

1.18.9 &#160; Tailings 

It is possible to construct the required tailings storage facility and a suitable site has been identified. Geochemical and hydrogeological test work has shown that the facility does not need to be lined.

1.18.10 &#160; Risks 

The qualitative risk assessment identified 56 risks of which 9 were extremely high before controls. After controls were applied the number of extremely high risks was reduced to two. These risks are:

1. &#160; The exploration permit covering the Molo pit expired in 2011 and has yet to be officially renewed (Exploration Permit #3432 is the permit in question). 

2. &#160; Current delays in issuing new mining permits. 

After controls were applied the remaining high risks are as follows, (reduced from 39 to 18):

1. Requirement that all voids / excavations be backfilled without exception. 

2. Inaccurate landownership data. 

3. The unit costs of moving product are high. 

4. Project NPV and IRR lower than the PEA 

5. Theft during construction &#38; operation (diesel, cable, etc.) 

6. No off take agreements signed yet or formal product specifications received. 

7. The current execution strategy calls for contracts to be placed before permits are granted. 

8. The project has modelled the diesel price at 0.8 US$ / litre. 

9. ESIA review timeframes could extend past the planned project start date - indications are 6-9 months for ESIA approval from date of submission to the O.N.E (The Madagascan Government department of the Environment) 

10. The process design may not achieve the optimal balance between the competing requirements of: 

i. Maximizing coarse flake recovery 

ii. Maximizing product carbon grade 

iii. Maximizing overall recovery 

11. Future Land Claims (Ancestral Rights). 

12. The process plant may not achieve a consistent on spec product, especially as the feed grade to the plant varies and this may make process control difficult. 

13. Madagascan political situation remains potentially unstable. 

14. Difficult logistics getting material on and off the island plus very bad roads. 

15. Contractors P&#38;G&#8217;s high due to locality. 

16. The projects returns are reliant on a real term increase in the price of graphite. 

17. Implementation of the preferential taxation arrangement may be difficult. 

18. The debt funding assumptions may not be achievable. 

&#160;

1.19 &#160; Recommendations 

&#160;

1.19.1 &#160; Geology 

No further recommendations at present.

1.19.2 &#160; Mining 

The long mine life of the Molo Graphite Project will allow for potential optimization of drilling and blasting designs during execution that could reduce operating costs slightly.

From a pure mining perspective the Molo Graphite Project is very small and provided reasonable levels of short term planning are applied it should have very few challenges in delivering the required tonnages at the required grade to meet the production targets set out in this Molo 2015 FS.

1.19.3 &#160; Metallurgical Test Work 

The following recommendations are made for additional metallurgical testwork prior to the detailed engineering stage:

&#183; Evaluate a range of different attrition mill media to determine if flake degradation can be reduced without affecting the concentrate grade; 

&#183; Develop a grinding energy versus concentrate grade relationship for the best grinding media. This will allowa more accurate prediction of the required attrition mill grinding energy as a function of the final concentrate grade; 

&#183; Conduct attrition mill vendor tests to aid in the sizing of the equipment; 

&#183; Carry out vendor testing on graphite tailings using the optimized reagent regime proposed by the reagent supplier; and 

&#183; Complete a series of flotation tests on samples covering the mine life past the initial 5 years. 

1.19.4 &#160; Recovery Methods 

Optimization and refinement opportunities exist regarding the process design which could reveal benefits over the equipment selections and unit process detail within the current design. The latter are based essentially on test work outcomes pursued and reported on thus far for study purposes.

&#160;

Appropriate test work is recommended prior to the initiation or during the course of a detailed design phase preceding construction. This would include the following:

&#183; Bulk material flow test work; 

&#183; Additional test work, in conjunction with vendors and in line with ongoing technical developments, aimed at further refinement of the polishing and attrition milling processes; 

&#183; Concentrate attritioning circuit static and dynamic thickening tests, including reagent scoping and optimization trials; 

&#183; Further investigation into potentially replacing the final tailings disposal positive displacement pumps withmore common centrifugal pump trains by reducing the slurry solids concentration for overland pumping. Thiswill include examination into whether the overall water balance and supply system can reasonably accommodate such a change. 

1.19.5 &#160; Infrastructure 

The following are recommended prior to the detailed design stage:

&#183; Additional geotechnical investigations at the proposed new construction and permanent camp site, particularly at the location of the new potable water storage tanks 

&#183; A detailed geotechnical investigation will need to be undertaken to identify and confirm suitable sources of concrete aggregate and concrete sand materials at the location of the project site. This testing will need to include for concrete material testing and the production of concrete trial mixes with the material identified 

&#183; The geotechnical information will also need to confirm the suitability for construction of all the material to beexcavated from the Return Water Dam (&#8220; RWD &#8221;). It is proposed that all the material excavated from the RWD is utilized in the works as processed fill material 

&#183; Confirmation as to whether the material from the proposed borrow pit near Fotadrevo (which will be used to supply all fill material for the TSF starter wall construction) can be utilized as fill material, or if this material can be stabilized in some manner and used in the works 

&#183; A detailed topographical survey will need to be undertaken of the proposed construction site, borrow pit areasand the access road between Fotadrevo and the mine site. This information is required prior to the final detailed design of the plant layout and associated earthworks 

&#160;

1.19.6 &#160; Water 

The following is recommended during the detailed design phase:

&#183; Updating the current dynamic water balance including a dynamic TSF water balance. The current water balance only assumed average monthly inflows from the TSF into the RWD. It would be recommended to confirm the water availability on the Molo Graphite Project if drought conditions occur and the TSF model element is included in the dynamic water balance 

&#183; Water quality and quantity data is required to provide a baseline for comparison once the Molo Mine is commissioned. To provide the necessary baseline data, regular ground and surface water quality monitoring must be carried out leading up to the date when the Molo Mine will be commissioned. Additionally proposed monitoring and scavenger wells must be installed. This also should include the installation of flow meters on relevant pipelines to verify the dynamic water balance with measured flow rates during operations 

&#183; The installation of a weather station on the Molo Graphite Project site should be done as soon as possible. 

&#183; The installation and testing of the additional well field boreholes must be undertaken. The groundwater resource model must be updated to include site specific borehole data. 

&#183; The environmental geochemical test work of the Molo 2015 FS should be confirmed by selective testing of samples from the latest exploration and metallurgical test programs. The geochemical model should be updated accordingly. 

1.19.7 &#160; Environmental, Social 

&#183; GCS recommends the installation of a suitable weather station at or as near as possible to the proposed project site, even before construction commences. Accurate, local weather data is almost non-existent in Madagascar. This data will prove invaluable for model calibration, improvement in baseline understanding and for future energy supply options which could utilize wind and or solar power generation 

&#183; Clean energy supply should be considered as a medium to long term target 

&#183; Appointment of a community representative and the establishment of a mandate to sensitize the local communities prior to any project activities 

&#183; Monitoring and auditing to commence at project preparation phase 

&#183; Compilation of Standard Operating Procedures for Environmental and Social aspects requiring direct management and intervention 

&#183; It is recommended that actual activity data, (e.g. kilometers travelled, or litres of diesel consumed) for a financial year is used when a Green House Gas (&#8220; GHG &#8221;) assessment is being calculated. Given that this project involves an estimation of a future GHG assessment for activities yet to begin, a series of assumptions have been made in order to obtain the activity data required to undertake this calculation 

&#183; Community recruitment, skills development and training should begin at project preparation phase 

1.19.8 &#160; Permitting 

&#183; An application for the exploration permit in Energizer&#8217;s name is a critical step in the larger permitting and licensing regime and requires early attention and dedicated involvement 

&#183; Security of land tenure is a process and is estimated to take 7 months, thus this process should be commissioned as early as possible 

&#183; Application for all other necessary permits (water use, construction, mineral processing, transportation, export, labour etc should be undertaken within the ESIA review period (6 months), which is expected to be from March till August 2015 

&#183; Compilation of a comprehensive legal register 

&#183; Municipal elections are scheduled for July 2015. It is recommended that all above-mentioned permitting processes should commence prior to and in anticipation of these elections. 

&#183; The permitting and licensing of the proposed Molo Graphite Project requires dedicated attention to ensure consistent momentum in application for and delivery of permits and licenses. This is extremely relevant within the Malagasy context. 

&#160;

&#160;

Tailings

Additional work required during detailed design of the TSF and adjacent RWD is as follows:

&#183; The full rheology and beaching characteristics for the tailings are not known which leaves uncertainties regarding the optimum deposition design. This will need to be investigated via large scale tests once suitably sized pilot process plant samples are available. It should be noted that such large scale tests will also provide additional more representative samples which can be used to carry out further testing of other tailings characteristics, such as consolidation, permeability and shear strength, which should be used to validate / revise the assumptions made for the stability assessments, seepage / drainage assessments and water balance 

&#183; The geotechnical investigation was carried out for the general TSF area only, and was not focused on the specific design elements as the location of these was not known at the time. Additional focused geotechnical investigations will be required to confirm the geotechnical conditions at specific locations 

&#183; The depth to groundwater is not known in the immediate vicinity of the RWD. In the event that ground water is shallow, it may not be possible to excavate the RWD basin to the required depth without employing dewatering measures, or alternatively constructing an additional RWD downstream. The depth to groundwater and any seasonal fluctuations will need to be investigated by installation of a groundwater monitoring borehole, which must be monitored during the wet season 

&#183; Water quality data is required over a period of time to provide a baseline for comparison once the TSF is commissioned. To provide the necessary baseline data, regular ground and surface water monitoring must be carried out leading up to the date when the TSF is commissioned 

&#183; The overall design will need to be developed to a level required for construction and to optimize the design with regard to technical, environmental and economic considerations, whilst taking due cognizance of additional information made available, including the additional studies detailed&#8221; 

Graphite Market and Pricing

Market Overview 

Energizer engaged Roskill to compile a report on markets for natural graphite up to 2020 which report was completed in January 2015. This market summary is to a large extent based on the Roskill report.

Graphite consumption comprises three different product lines, namely synthetic graphite, natural amorphous graphite and natural flake graphite. Price is often the major deciding factor in choosing between natural flake and synthetic, although each also has specific characteristics which need to be considered for a particular application. For example in the production of lithium-ion anode materials, natural flake graphite may be chosen due to price although synthetic graphite may be more suitable in some formulations.

In those applications where they compete, synthetic graphite prices are higher than natural graphite prices due essentially to higher production costs. This is somewhat offset by the purification cost to raise most natural graphite to sufficient purity. It is estimated that in 2013, the difference between comparable synthetic and natural grades was US$1,000 per tonne. Amorphous graphite is used in such applications as the refractories industry, as recarburisers, in brake linings, gaskets and clutch materials and in foundries in mould wash.

Natural Graphite is graded into 3 forms: Flake, Amorphous and Lump. A majority of the world&#8217;s graphite supply is amorphous (fine or powder) and is used for traditional purposes such as automotive and steel making. Flake graphite is essential for producing batteries, specifically lithium-ion, and for use in consumer electronics. The Molo Graphite Project contains flake graphite. Flake graphite prices are a function of 2 factors - flake size and purity - with large flake (+80 mesh), high Carbon (+94%) varieties commanding premium pricing. Like uranium, there is a posted price for graphite which provides a guideline with respect to longer term trends but transactions are largely based on direct negotiations between the buyer and seller.

Notes:

2 Including 35,000t of amorphous graphite in decarburising. 

3 Mainly consumption in re-carburisers, but also in foundries, friction materials and refractories. 

&#160;

&#160;

Natural flake graphite is consumed in refractories, foundry applications, batteries, as battery additives, in fuel cells, friction products, lubricants, shapes and expandable graphite.

In 2013, production of natural flake graphite totaled 427,300 tonnes. Output of flake graphite reached a peak of some 500 000 tonnes in 2012, of which 60% originated in China. Other significant producers of flake graphite are Brazil, India, Canada and Norway. The table below illustrates production of flake graphite worldwide and the dominance of Asian, more specifically Chinese, production.

Chinese flake graphite production is currently fragmented and includes a significant number of small operations with 10 000 tonne per annum capacity or less. A process of consolidation is underway, which began in Inner Mongolia during 2010 and started in Shandong and Heilongjiang during 2014. This will create new industry giants in the country situated in these three centers.

Several foreign companies have invested in China, in order to secure supplies. Many existing Chinese mines are coming to the end of their working lives and a number outside China have become exhausted in recent years.

A number of new flake graphite projects that are under development will increase capacity outside China in the coming years. In a recent development a Canadian graphite project announced a significant off take agreement with a Chinese industrial conglomerate of 40,000 tonne, suggesting that security of supply is becoming increasingly important to manufacturers in China, as well as in the rest of the world.

Apart from China, capacity is concentrated in Brazil and India but is also present in a number of other countries. Of these, the leading producer is Nacional de Grafite of Brazil, which has at least 75,000 tonnes per annum of capacity.

Natural graphite production is forecast to grow by 5.4% per annum in the years to 2020 as growing demand for flake graphite drives expansions and new product development. This estimate includes established projects realizing production on their announced timeline. A total of 188,500t of new capacity could come on stream by 2020, however, more realistically this total will be in the region of 100,000t, which would provide a lower CAGR of 3% per annum. This assumes no increase in production in China, due to on-going consolidation. Production of high-purity natural graphite will continue to be concentrated in China.

&#160;

&#160;

There is currently significant overcapacity in the synthetic graphite market as well as increasing competition from new plants in China, India and Russia. Producers will be able to increase supply to meet likely increases in demand.

A large amount of graphite exploration has been carried out over the last five years as concerns grew over a potential future tightness/shortage of supply. Development of new capacity is focused on high grade, large flake deposits, driven by growing demand from both the traditional markets of refractories and brake linings, and from the emerging, and rapidly growing, markets of lithium-ion batteries and expandable / expanded graphite.

By 2016, many of the prospective new projects had seen little progress and only a handful have reached pre-feasibility.

Broadly speaking graphite prices increase with flake size and carbon content. In practice other factors come into play and the price will depend on the location of the supplier and purchaser and the logistics involved, the agreed contract type and length, graphite specifications as well as underlying production and processing costs.

Published flake graphite prices for fine, medium and large flake sizes are shown in the graph below (average of all carbon grades), illustrating the price premium by size. After the price hike in 2011, and decline in 2012 to 2014, prices have stabilized in 2015.

&#160;

Overall natural flake graphite prices are expected to recover in line with, and above, economic activity. The level of price recovery overall will depend on degree of consolidation in the Chinese flake graphite industry and its impact and the recovery and production levels in the steel industry.

Mining projects are commonly evaluated using two or three year trailing averages. However, the significant price spike in 2011 and 2012 distorts the picture such that historic averages are not representative. The subsequent fall of graphite prices means that the historic averages are higher than current prices. Prices have been relatively stable during 2014 and 2015 and have now started to see some upward pressure. It is therefore assumed that this represents the bottom of the market. 

&#160;

The conclusion that this is the bottom of the market also takes into account the consolidation of the Chinese natural flake graphite sector over the next two to three years, which may constrict supply, the closure of a North American mine in 2013, and the forecast growth in demand. These combined factors should eliminate any further downside in prices from the present levels, and present opportunities for further growth. Capital and operation costs are also rising, which in the medium to longer term will eliminate more marginal producers, and keep the outlook for graphite prices healthy.

For medium and large flake sized material, new supply is not expected on stream in 2015 to step into any shortfalls from Chinese production restrictions, which could put some upward pressure on pricing levels, especially in Europe. This could cause short term fluctuations of $200-300 per tonne around the average growth rates, or even as much as $400 per tonne for jumbo flakes. In mid-2016, new scheduled production from Mozambique having a significant proportion of larger flake could replace a portion of Chinese material. From 2017 onwards, the effects of the consolidation process are expected to be largely complete and the Chinese industry reorganised into much larger enterprises.

For fine flake material of 90-96%, graphite prices are expected to rise just above economic activity, especially in refractories, foundries and crucibles markets which represent most of the volume. This material is also not expected to see quite the same upward price pressure in 2016.

Chinese FOB flake graphite prices are expected to increase with production costs and supply restrictions within the country, especially for larger flake sizes in 2015 and potentially in 2016. This will maintain or even raise price levels during a period when there is predicted slowdown in growth in the Chinese industry and household purchasing index.

Permitting in Madagascar

&#160;

Companies in Madagascar first apply for an exploration mining permit with the Bureau de Cadastre Minier de Madagascar (&#8220;BCMM&#8221;), a government agency falling under the authority of the Minister of Mines. Permits are granted under usual circumstances are generally issued within a month. The 2014 fees per square within a mining permit range from approximately 92,500 Ariary to 500,000 Ariary (between $35 and $194 using a current exchange rate of 2,580 Madagascar Ariary = $1 USD). The number of squares varies widely by claim number. For the 2014 year, the Company paid approximately $400,000 to the BCMM to renew all of its claims in Madagascar. This fee covered both the 100% owned Green Giant Property (6 claims) and the Molo Graphite Property (39 claims). Each year the Company is required to pay a similar amount in order to maintain the claims in good standing.

The next step in the permitting process, which our Company has initiated, is to apply for an exploitation permit. Our company has engaged a third party environmental study company in Madagascar to assist us with this process. In order to get an exploitation permit, an investment plan, exploitation work plan budget and specific ground mapping is submitted to the BCMM. This step is completed in conjunction with a submission of an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (&#8220;ESIA&#8221;), which was submitted on January 30, 2015. This environmental impact study includes, among other things, completion of a water study and a social impact study.

QA/QC Protocols

&#160;

At all times during sample collection, storage, and shipment to the laboratory facility, the samples are in the control of our Company or parties that we have contracted to act as our agents.

When sufficient sample material (grab, trench or core) has been collected, the samples are flown or sent by truck to our storage location in Antananarivo, Madagascar. At all times samples are accompanied by an employee, consultant or agent of our Company. From there, samples are shipped to labs either in South Africa or Canada for ICP-MS analysis.

All analytical results are e-mailed directly by the lab to the Company&#8217;s project manager on site in Madagascar and to our company&#8217;s geological and executive staff. Results are also posted on a secure website and downloaded by our company&#8217;s personnel using a secure username and password. All of the labs that carried out the sampling and analytical work are independent of our company.

In order to carry out QA/QC protocols on the assays, blanks, standards and duplicates were inserted into the sample streams. This was done once in every 30 samples, representing an insertion rate of 3.33% of the total.

&#160;

&#160;

Since the 2009 Madagascar drill program, our company has rigorously implemented a blank protocol. For the Molo Graphite Deposit a fine-grained quartz sand sourced from a hardware store in Antananarivo was used as the blank material for the sampling campaign. A total of 208 blank samples were used in this program. A detection limit of 0.05% Carbon was used for the purpose of this exercise. To verify the reliability of the blank samples, the detection limit and the blank + 2, and 3 times the detection limit were plotted against the date. The plot shows that there are a lot of blank samples that have concentrations that exceed the blank + 3 times detection limit threshold. This, coupled with the large spread of data points, would lead to the assumption that samples may have been contaminated during their preparation for analysis.

Blanks plot &#8211; Log %C versus the date of the analysis.

Since certified reference materials (&#8220;CRMs&#8221;) are essentially non-existent for graphite, our Company commissioned a third party lab in Canada to create a CRM from the remaining Molo Graphite Deposit drill core pulps from the 2011 program. As certified the third party lab standard (STD 1 C) a recommended value of 9.11 % Carbon.

To check the reliability of the standard, a plot of the recommended CRM value versus date was created. The upper and lower limits of one, two and three times the standard deviations of the recommended value are also included in the plot. All the results except for two fall within the acceptable limit of two times the standard deviation. It is however worth noting that there seems to be a negative bias towards lower concentrations in the first batch of samples that were submitted. As the campaign progressed the bias leant towards the positive side. This issue appears to have been sorted out towards the latter parts of the campaign as the data becomes less spread, and is closer to the recommended value.

For the Molo Graphite Deposit, 205 field duplicates were prepared. To check how close these were to the original samples, a plot of the original samples with a zero, five, and ten per cent difference of the original samples was created. The majority of the samples were within the 10% difference limit. The plot also shows a good correlation between the original value and the duplicate, as is evident from the regression line with an R 2 value of 0.96.

Milestones

We are pursuing negotiations in respect of potential off-take agreements with graphite end-users and intermediaries with the intention of securing project financing alternatives, which may include debt, equity and derivative instruments. Discussions in respect of these matters have been ongoing for the past 24 months and are expected to continue during the coming months with no assurances as to the conclusion or results of these discussions.

In July 2016, we appointed UK-based HCF International Advisers Limited ("HCF") as advisor in negotiating and structuring strategic partnerships, off take agreements and debt financing for its Molo Graphite project.

&#160;

In August 2016, we initiated a Front End Engineering Design Study (the &#8220;FEED Study&#8221;) for the Company's Molo graphite project in Madagascar. The FEED Study is being undertaken in order to determine potential development path options that have been presented to the Company by prospective strategic partners.

Our management continues to assess project optimization strategies with the intention of reducing the capital and operating costs relating to the Molo Graphite Property with no assurances as to the conclusion and results of these assessments.

Future Plans

With the completion of the Molo Feasibility Study, potential financiers and strategic partners have been approached, and the Company is seeking funding for the development of the Molo Deposit into a mine. In parallel, the Company has initiated a FEED Study, which is anticipated to continue through to the end of October, 2016.

Green Giant Project, Southern Madagascar, Africa

During 2007, we acquired a 75% interest in the property. We paid $765,000, issued 2,500,000 common shares and 1,000,000 now expired common share purchase warrants to enter into a joint venture agreement for the Green Giant Property with Madagascar Minerals and Resources Sarl ("MMR"). On July 9, 2009, we acquired the remaining 25% interest for $100,000. MMR retains a 2% NSR. The NSR can be purchased at our option, for $500,000 in cash or common shares for the first 1% NSR and at a price of $1,000,000 in cash or common shares for the second 1% NSR.

The Green Giant project comprises claims located in south &#8208; central Madagascar located in the UTM zone 38S on the WGS 84 datum at coordinates 510,000 E 7,350,000 N, 145 km southeast of the city of Toliara, in the Tulear region/Fotadrevo, covering an area of 225 km2 situated in two separate blocks. The property is composed of two separate groups of four and two Research Permits respectively. 

The discovery of potentially economic vanadium mineralization on the property changed the focus of the 2008 diamond &#8208; drilling program. Through a combination of prospecting, ground based scintillometer surveying, and analysis of a published airborne radiometric survey, five extensive vanadium &#8208; bearing trends were identified during the 2008 exploration program. These vanadiferous trends are theorized to have formed in a black shale or paleo &#8208; roll &#8208; front environment before being subjected to regional granulite facies metamorphism.

Energizer selected the Jaky and Manga vanadium &#8208; bearing trend as the most prospective targets on the property and focus the late 2009 &#8208; drill program at delineating mineralized material on these two deposits. Various metallurgical scoping test programs have been completed since Q4 2009, covering physical and chemical pre-concentration processes, acid and alkaline leaching (atmospheric and pressure), alkaline salt roasting and high definition mineralogical characterization. Mineralogical characterization of several silicate samples has revealed a unique deportment of vanadium at Green Giant. Vanadium bearing minerals include clays, micas, oxides, and sulphides.

The mineral deposits on this property have been divided into three separate zones, which are referred to as the Jaky, Manga, and Mainty deposits. The vanadium deposits on the Green Giant property are split into two separate categories: oxide and primary. The mineralization analysis utilized 18,832 m of diamond drill hole data from the 2008, 2009, and 2010 drill programs and was supplemented by approximately 5,928 m of trench data from the 2008 and 2009 exploration programs.

Since early 2012, the Company has focused its efforts on the Molo Project and as such only minimal work has been completed on the property since that time.

&#160;

Sagar Property, Labrador Trough Region, Quebec, Canada

In 2006, the Company purchased from Virginia Mines Inc. ("Virginia") a 100% interest in 382 claims located in northern Quebec, Canada. Virginia retains a 2% net smelter return royalty ("NSR") on certain claims within the property. Other unrelated parties also retain a 1% NSR and a 0.5% NSR on certain claims within the property, of which half of the 1% NSR can be acquired by the Company by paying $200,000 and half of the 0.5% NSR can be acquired by the Company by paying $100,000.

On February 28, 2014, the Company signed an agreement to sell a 35% interest in the Sagar property to Honey Badger Exploration Inc. (&#8220;Honey Badger&#8221;), a public company that is a related party through common management. The terms of the agreement were subsequently amended on July 31, 2014 and again on May 8, 2015. To earn the 35% interest, Honey Badger was required to complete a payment of $36,045 (CAD$50,000) by December 31, 2015, incur exploration expenditures of $360,450 (CAD$500,000) by December 31, 2016 and issue 20,000,000 common shares to the Company by December 31, 2015. Honey Badger did not complete the earn-in requirements by December 31, 2015 resulting in the termination of the option agreement.
