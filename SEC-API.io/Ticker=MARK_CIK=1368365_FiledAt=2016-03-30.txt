 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS. 

OVERVIEW 

Remark Media, Inc. and subsidiaries (&#8220;Remark&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, or &#8220;our&#8221;) own, operate and acquire innovative digital media properties across multiple verticals &#32;( described below under Technology and Digital Media Services &#32;and Other Digital Media Assets ) that deliver culturally relevant, dynamic content that attracts and engages users on a global scale. We leverage our unique digital media assets to target the Millennial demographic, which provides us with access to fast-growing, lucrative markets. We were originally incorporated in Delaware in March 2006 as HSW International, Inc., and we changed our name to Remark Media, Inc. in December 2011. We are headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, with additional operations in Beijing and Chengdu, China. Our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbol MARK. 

OUR BUSINESS 

Development 

In 2009, we co-founded a U.S.-based venture, Sharecare, to build a web-based platform that simplifies the search for health and wellness information. The other co-founders of Sharecare were Dr. Mehmet Oz, HARPO Productions, Discovery Communications, Jeff Arnold and Sony Pictures Television. As a part of the transactions, we received an equity stake in Sharecare, which constitutes approximately five percent &#32;of Sharecare&#8217;s issued stock at December 31, 2015 . We also maintain representation on Sharecare&#8217;s Board of Directors. 

In June 2012, we began building our personal finance vertical with the acquisition of Banks.com, Inc. (&#8220;Banks.com&#8221;). In February 2014, we expanded our suite of personal finance portals with the acquisition of TaxExtension.com. After extensively redesigning the website, we relaunched Banks.com in November 2014 with a focus on the Millennial demographic. 

In March 2013 we entered the young adult lifestyle vertical with the acquisition of Pop Factory, LLC, a beach lifestyle digital media brand providing website and mobile content. Later the same year, we introduced a refreshed brand and a new, mobile-optimized website at www.bikini.com, which includes e-commerce. 

In May 2014, we acquired Hotelmobi, Inc. (&#8220;Hotelmobi&#8221;), owner and operator of the mobile hotel-booking application Roomlia, giving us a foothold in the travel vertical that we believe is very important to our target customers. 

With a continued focus on the millennial demographic, we transitioned in 2015 from being a strictly content-based company to a technology company leveraging KanKan, our data intelligence platform and social media application. We developed and are continuing to develop features that engage KanKan&#8217;s users, as well as features that will make KanKan an attractive data source to us, advertisers and other third-parties. In early 2015, we opened our office in Chengdu, China to fast track the development of KanKan. 

In September 2015, we expanded our presence in the travel vertical and significantly increased the size of our business with our acquisition of Vegas.com LLC (&#8220;Vegas.com&#8221;). Specifically, we acquired Vegas.com to give us a deeper reach into the travel and entertainment market in Las Vegas and the surrounding area because Vegas.com is a well-established brand and, through websites and mobile applications that it controls, it allows users to book travel to, and lodging and entertainment in, the Las-Vegas-area market. We were also attracted by the fact that websites controlled by Vegas.com currently enjoy more than 60 million user sessions annually, which we believe will allow us to drive demand to many of our business properties, thereby increasing revenue. By capitalizing on the data intelligence provided by KanKan, we can target potential repeat travelers who visited Las Vegas within the past three years, people currently in Las Vegas who may want to book entertainment or tours, and potential travelers who have never visited Las Vegas but have expressed an interest in doing so. 

In the foreseeable future, we will continue to develop KanKan and monetize its capabilities, we will improve Vegas.com&#8217;s various websites and mobile applications and leverage their capabilities to improve user engagement, and we also plan to continue our efforts to strategically acquire existing businesses that fit with our continued focus on Millennials. 

Financial Statement Index 

Business Model 

We currently earn a majority of our revenue from sales of various travel and entertainment products (including lodging, air travel, show tickets and tours) booked through our travel and entertainment segment, consisting of Vegas.com and its related websites (including LasVegas.com), mobile applications and retail locations. Our management is currently integrating certain of the operations of our travel and entertainment segment (including the operations of our Vegas.com and Roomlia subsidiaries) and is evaluating the results of the two subsidiaries collectively. 

We also recognize revenue from the following sources: 

&#8226; 

service fees from customers&#8217; filing of business and personal tax returns and extensions with the IRS 

&#8226; 

sales of merchandise via our Bikini.com website 

&#8226; 

various advertising mechanisms associated with our websites 

We earn advertising revenue from performance-based advertising and from display advertising. Performance-based advertising revenue is earned through such mechanisms as cost-per-click, in which an advertiser pays for each instance a user clicks on its advertisement, and cost-per-lead, in which an advertiser pays for each instance a user clicks on its advertisement and buys its product or service. Display advertising mechanisms include cost-per-impression, in which an advertiser pays for each display of an advertisement, and having an advertiser pay for placement of its ads in more desirable locations on our web pages. 

Excluding general and administrative expense, the primary costs we incur to earn the revenue described above include: 

&#8226; 

credit card fees 

&#8226; 

costs related to providing tours, such as permits, fees, fuel, vehicle leases and vehicle repair 

&#8226; 

software and website development costs, including licensing costs for third-party software 

&#8226; 

costs associated with marketing our brands 

&#8226; 

costs associated with developing and producing the content on our websites 

&#160; 

Technology and Digital Media Services 

KanKan, our social media application and data intelligence platform, aggregates content and consumer-shopping data across all major social media platforms around the world and then stores it after scrubbing, analyzing, and organizing the collected information. For users, the application allows them to explore the world around them, communicate with friends, make new friends, and respond to each other&#8217;s social media posts, regardless of the social media network on which activity originates. For us, amassing data on over 1.3 billion socially-active user profiles globally allows us to understand consumer trends, preferences and behavior. Such insight enables us to enhance user engagement and brand awareness across all of our digital media properties more effectively and efficiently. 

Our new travel and entertainment reportable segment includes the recently-acquired Vegas.com and our Roomlia mobile application. We believe that Vegas.com is the premiere online booking service for all of the exciting travel and entertainment opportunities related to Las Vegas and the immediately-surrounding areas. Vegas.com offers users the ability to book lodging, air travel, show tickets and tours, and its customer service team is staffed by Las Vegas locals who are intimately familiar with Las Vegas and the various products and services offered through the website. To increase our share of the travel and entertainment market in Las Vegas and the immediately-surrounding areas, we can use data from KanKan to target potential repeat travelers who visited Las Vegas within the past three years, people currently in Las Vegas who may want to book entertainment or tours, and potential travelers who have never visited Las Vegas but have expressed an interest in doing so. 

Financial Statement Index 

Our Roomlia mobile hotel-booking application allows users to reserve lodging at participating hotels up to seven days prior to commencement of stay. Roomlia contracts with participating hotels and uses a proprietary hotel merchandising system that enables it to offer room rates that may not be available through other third-party reservation channels. 

Other Digital Media Assets 

Personal Finance 

Our Banks.com website provides content for young adults that shares stories of financial success and failure, the humanity of making and losing money, and what users can learn from it all. The content mixes long-form, first person accounts with daily news shorts and other information intended to be informative and engaging regarding a topic that people can otherwise find to be difficult to understand. 

US Tax Center at www.irs.com provides users with access to U.S. tax-related information and services. Our Filelater.com website and Taxextension.com website assist taxpayers with filing both business and personal tax extensions with the IRS. Because our online platform is directly connected to the IRS system, we can provide our users with status updates on their extension filings directly from the IRS. 

Young Adult Lifestyle 

Bikini.com is our online beach lifestyle destination for young women. We designed the flagship website to target social media integration and to optimize the experience for mobile users. In addition to offering merchandise online, we provide original editorial content covering the latest in fashion, beauty, travel, and health and fitness trends. We complement the editorial content with a carefully-curated collection of swimwear and accessories containing the latest in must-have seasonal trends, offered through the website&#8217;s online boutique. Our merchandise is targeted at several price tiers, allowing us to develop long-term relationships with our customers that begin when they are young students and continue throughout their personal and professional lives. 

Online Entertainment 

&#32;SlapTV provides an edgy mix of horror and comedy in the form of short films, web sketches and man-on-the-street pieces. The website, which has an associated Youtube channel, produces original content as well as hosting content created by a growing group of independent actors and artists. Launched in December 2014, SlapTV simultaneously promotes its own brand while also serving as a platform where up-and-coming talent can grow with us. 

Additionally, SlapTV is expanding its production to include mainstream advertising that promotes our brands as well as third-party brands. We intend to further develop this aspect of SlapTV to reduce our own advertising cost and increase revenue. 

Competition 

We compete for business in a number of content verticals, many of which are rapidly-evolving and intensely competitive. The primary factors upon which we compete are price, audience access and content quality. We believe the following are our primary competitors in the various content verticals in which we operate: 

Travel 

&#8226; 

online travel reservation services such as The Priceline Group (priceline.com, booking.com) and Expedia (expedia.com, hotels.com, hotwire.com, travelocity.com, orbitz.com) 

&#8226; 

online travel search services and price comparison services such as TripAdvisor, trivago (majority-owned by Expedia), and HotelsCombined 

Financial Statement Index 

&#8226; 

websites, such as Bestofvegas.com and Showtickets.com, that sell tickets to Las Vegas-area events 

&#8226; 

traditional &#8220;brick-and-mortar&#8221; retailers, such as Tix4tonight, that sell tickets to Las Vegas-area events 

Personal Finance 

&#8226; 

tax software such as Intuit&#8217;s Turbotax 

&#8226; 

tax-related websites such as turbotax.com, expressextension.com and irsextension.com 

&#8226; 

traditional tax preparers such as H&#38;R Block and Jackson Hewitt 

&#8226; 

financial information websites such as thesimpledollar.com and wisebread.com 

Young Adult Lifestyle 

&#8226; 

lifestyle and luxury clothing websites for young women, such as Refinery29 and Net-A-Porter 

&#8226; 

other websites such as The Skimm 

Entertainment 

&#8226; 

humor websites such as collegehumor.com, funnyordie.com, crypttv.com and mydamnchannel.com 

Some of the companies we compete against, or may compete against in the future, may have greater brand recognition and may have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. As a result of the potentially greater brand recognition and resources, some of our competitors may bring new products and services to market more quickly, and they may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we could adopt. 

We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees, as well as our ability to retain and motivate our existing employees, while efficiently managing compensation-related costs. 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We rely upon trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in various jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary assets and brands. We have filed a provisional patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in relation to Roomlia, and we own two patents and several copyright registrations related to Vegas.com. We also hold various trademarks for our brands, and we have additional applications pending. 

Technology 

Our technologies include software applications built to run on third-party cloud hosting providers including Amazon Web Services and Alibaba located in North America and Asia. We make substantial use of off-the-shelf available open-source technologies such as Linux, PHP, MySQL, Drupal, mongoDB, Memcache, Apache, Nginx, CouchBase, Hadoop, HBase, ElasticSearch, Lua, Java, Redis, Akka and Wordpress, in addition to commercial platforms such as Microsoft, including Windows Operating Systems, SQL Server, and .NET. Such systems are connected to the Internet via load balancers, firewalls, and routers installed in multiple redundant pairs. We also utilize third-party services to geographically deliver data using major content distribution network providers. We rely heavily on virtualization throughout our technology architecture, which affords scaling dozens of digital media properties in an efficient and cost effective manner. 

Financial Statement Index 

We use third-party cloud hosting providers to host most of our public-facing websites and applications, as well as many of our back-end business intelligence and financial systems. Each of our significant websites is designed to be fault-tolerant, with collections of application servers, typically configured in a load-balanced state, to provide additional resiliency. The infrastructure is equipped with enterprise-class security solutions to combat events such as large scale distributed denial of service attacks. Our environment is staffed and equipped with a full scale monitoring solution. 

Governmental Regulation 

The services we provide are subject to various laws and regulations. We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry and the provision of travel services, including laws requiring us to register as &#8220;sellers of travel&#8221; and compliance with certain disclosure requirements. In addition, our travel business is subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation, including those relating to advertising and accessibility. 

We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content regulation, intellectual property, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation or other subjects. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. There are a number of legislative proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies concerning data protection that may affect us. 

Privacy concerns relating to the disclosure of consumer financial information have drawn increased attention from federal and state governments. For example, the IRS generally prohibits the use or disclosure by tax return preparers of taxpayers&#8217; information without the prior written consent of the taxpayer. In addition, other regulations require financial service providers to adopt and disclose consumer privacy policies and provide consumers with a reasonable opportunity to &#8220;opt-out&#8221; of having personal information disclosed to unaffiliated third-parties for marketing purposes. 

We post our privacy policy and practices concerning the use and disclosure of any user data on our web properties and our distribution applications. Any failure by us to comply with posted privacy policies, federal and state regulatory requirements or foreign privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings by governmental or regulatory bodies that could potentially harm our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. 

Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. The government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China has at times taken measures to restrict digital platforms, publishers or specific content themes from consumption by its citizens. We invest significant efforts into ensuring that our published content in China is consistent with our most current understanding of prevailing Chinese laws, regulations, and policies; and to date our published content in China has been met with successful distribution and no action or inquiry from the Chinese government. However, our business could be harmed by unforeseen regulatory restrictions or policy changes in China regarding digital content. 

Employees 

We employed approximately 238 people as of March 28, 2016 , including 225 full-time employees.
