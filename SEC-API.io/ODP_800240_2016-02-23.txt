 Item 1. Business 

Staples Acquisition 

On February 4, 2015, Staples, Inc. (&#147;Staples&#148;) and the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement (the &#147;Staples Merger Agreement&#148;), under which Staples will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Office Depot and the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Staples (the &#147;Staples Acquisition&#148;). Under the terms of the Staples Merger Agreement, Office Depot shareholders will receive, for each Office Depot share held by such shareholders, $7.25 in cash and 0.2188 of a share in Staples common stock at closing (the &#147;Merger Consideration&#148;). Each employee share-based award outstanding at the date of the Staples Merger Agreement will vest upon the effective date of the Staples Acquisition. Upon the effective date of the Staples Acquisition, employee share-based awards subsequently granted in 2015 will be converted into a contingent right to receive the cash equivalent of the Merger Consideration subject to the same terms and conditions of the corresponding award; provided that performance and vesting periods shall be reduced in duration. The Staples Merger Agreement includes representations, warranties and conditions, including breakup fees payable or receivable under certain conditions if the transaction fails to close. Under the Staples Merger Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes will be discharged, redeemed or defeased at the Effective Time of the Staples Acquisition. 

The transaction has been approved by both companies&#146; Boards of Directors and Office Depot shareholders. The completion of the Staples Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions including, among others, regulatory approvals under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and under 

&#160; 

the antitrust and competition laws of the European Union and Canada. The Company and Staples have received antitrust clearance for the transaction from regulators in Australia, New Zealand and China. 

On December 7, 2015, the United States Federal Trade Commission (the &#147;FTC&#148;) informed Office Depot and Staples that it intends to block the Staples Acquisition. On the same date, Office Depot and Staples announced their intent to contest the FTC&#146;s decision to challenge the transaction. Also on December 7, 2015, the Canadian Competition Bureau filed an application to block the transaction with the Canadian Competition Tribunal. On February 2, 2016, the Company and Staples entered into a letter agreement to waive, until May 16, 2016, certain of their respective rights to terminate the Staples Merger Agreement. 

On February 10, 2016, Staples announced that it has received conditional approval from European Union regulatory authorities to acquire Office Depot and the parties plan to divest Office Depot&#146;s European businesses in connection with the consummation of the pending acquisition of Office Depot by Staples. 

On February 16, 2016, Staples announced an agreement to sell more than $550 million in large corporate contract business and related assets for $22.5 million, contingent upon successful completion of the Staples Acquisition. 

Refer to the Company&#146;s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 4, 2015 (the &#147;Staples Merger Form 8-K&#148;) for additional information on the transaction. For further information on expenses incurred in 2015 related to the Staples Acquisition, refer to Part II &#151; Item 7. &#147;MD&#38;A&#148; of this Annual Report. 

Merger and Integration 

On November 5, 2013, the Company completed its merger with OfficeMax Incorporated (&#147;OfficeMax&#148;) in an all-stock transaction (the &#147;Merger&#148;). Since the Merger date, OfficeMax&#146;s financial results have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements, as discussed herein. 

From the Merger date through the end of 2015, significant progress has been made on key integration activities, including the implementation of the Company&#146;s real estate strategy (the &#147;Real Estate Strategy&#148;) which identified at least 400 retail stores for closure through 2016 along with planned changes to the supply chain. In the United States, we closed 168 and 181 retail stores in 2014 and 2015, respectively, converted all stores to common point of sale systems, completed certain warehouse cross-banner consolidations and platform modifications, successfully launched the co-branded website (www.officedepot.com), combined operating support functions, transitioned certain customers from the OfficeMax to the Office Depot platform, and made significant progress on identifying customer preferences and developing methods to service their needs. Integration activities will continue in 2016 and certain supply chain activities are currently anticipated to be substantially completed by the end of 2017. 

The remaining discussion of the &#147;Business&#148; section in this Annual Report addresses the way the Company operates currently; however, the integration will continue to impact many of these processes in future periods. 

The Company 

Office Depot is a global provider of office products and services. Office Depot was incorporated in Delaware in 1986 with the opening of its first retail store in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 

The Company sells products and services to consumers and businesses of all sizes through three reportable segments (or &#147;Divisions&#148;): North American Retail Division, North American Business Solutions Division and International Division. Sales for these Divisions are processed through multiple channels, consisting of office supply stores, a contract sales force, Internet sites, an outbound telephone account management sales force, direct marketing catalogs and call centers, all supported by a network of supply chain facilities and delivery operations. Office Depot currently operates under the Office Depot &#174; and OfficeMax &#174; brands and utilizes other proprietary company and product brand names. 

Additional information regarding our Divisions and operations in geographic areas is presented below in Part II &#151; Item 7. &#147;MD&#38;A&#148; and in Note 17, &#147;Segment Information,&#148; of the Consolidated Financial Statements located in Part IV &#151; Item 15. &#147;Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules&#148; of this Annual Report. 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s primary website is www.officedepot.com. The Company&#146;s primary brands are discussed in the &#147;Intellectual Property&#148; section below. 

Fiscal Year 

Our fiscal year results are based on a 52- or 53-week retail calendar ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013 consisted of 52 weeks and ended on December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013, respectively. Fiscal year 2016 will have 53 weeks. The Company&#146;s business in Canada, which has been included in the Company&#146;s results since the date of the Merger maintains calendar years with December 31 year-ends. The difference in reporting periods does not have a significant impact on the Company&#146;s reported results. 

North American Retail Division 

The North American Retail Division sells a broad assortment of merchandise through our chain of office supply stores throughout the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We currently offer products and services in the following categories: supplies, technology, and furniture and other. Refer to the &#147;Merchandising&#148; section below for additional product information. Most retail stores also offer copy and print services, as discussed in the &#147;Copy &#38; Print Depot TM &#148; section below. 

At the end of 2015, the North American Retail Division operated 1,564 office supply stores. The count of open stores may include locations temporarily closed for remodels or other factors. We have a broad representation across North America with the largest concentration of our retail stores in Texas, Florida, and California. The majority of our retail stores are located in leased facilities that currently average over 20,000 square feet. 

As part of the integration of the Office Depot and OfficeMax stores, we have made significant progress in our Real Estate Strategy, which anticipates the closure of at least 400 stores in North America through 2016. We closed 168 stores in 2014, 181 in 2015, and expect to close more than 50 stores in 2016. Closures include both Office Depot and OfficeMax locations. Implementation of this strategy results in charges for facility closures, termination costs, and asset impairments. Refer to Part II &#151; Item 7. &#147;MD&#38;A&#148; for additional information on the store activity. 

The retail stores operate under their legacy banners of Office Depot or OfficeMax, though systems, processes and offerings continue to converge. In 2015, the Company combined the previously existing separate Office Depot and OfficeMax loyalty programs, completed the conversion of all U.S. stores to a common point of sale system and harmonized product offerings. 

The Company has embraced an omni-channel focus, including an expanded Buy Online-Pickup in Store offering to reach mobile customers however they choose to shop. Sales fulfilled with store merchandise are included in North America Retail Division results, including the computation of comparable store sales. 

Refer to the &#147;North American Supply Chain&#148; discussion below for additional information on our supply chain network. 

Sales and marketing efforts are integral to understanding the Divisions&#146; processes and management. These efforts are addressed after the Divisions discussions. 

North American Business Solutions Division 

The North American Business Solutions Division sells nationally branded and our own brands&#146; products and services to customers in Canada and the United States, including Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Office Depot customers are served by a dedicated sales force, through catalogs, telesales, and electronically through our Internet sites. Refer to the &#147;Merchandising&#148; section below for additional product information. The North American Business Solutions Division also offers copy and print services, as discussed in the &#147;Copy &#38; Print Depot TM &#148; section below. 

&#160; 

Our contract sales channel employs a dedicated inside and field sales force that services the office supply needs to a range of small, medium and large-sized businesses. Our contract business customers also include various schools and local, state and national governmental agencies. We also enter into agreements with consortiums to sell to various entities and across industries, including governmental and non-profit entities, for non-exclusive buying arrangements. Sales to our contract customers that are fulfilled at retail locations are included in the results of our North American Retail Division, while honoring their contract pricing, as applicable. 

Our direct sales channel primarily serves small- to medium-sized customers. Direct customers can order products through our public websites, from our catalogs, or by phone. Website functionality provides customers the convenience of using the loyalty program and offers suggestions by product ratings, pricing, and brand, among other features. Customer orders are fulfilled through our common supply chain; refer to the &#147;North American Supply Chain&#148; discussion below for additional information on our supply chain network. 

Copy &#38; Print Depot TM 

Office Depot Copy &#38; Print Depot TM provides printing, digital imaging, reproduction, mailing, shipping through UPS, FedEx, and the U.S. Postal Service, and other services. We also maintain nationwide availability of personal computer (&#147;PC&#148;) support and network installation service that provides our customers with in-home, in-office and in-store support for their technology needs. Sales are recognized by the respective Division based on how the customer order is serviced. 

North American Supply Chain 

We operate a network of distribution centers (or &#147;DCs&#148;) and crossdock facilities across the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada. Certain of our DCs operate as flow-through facilities where merchandise is sorted for distribution and shipped to fulfill the inventory needs of our retail stores and customers. Some DCs in the OfficeMax network are larger facilities primarily serving the retail business. The crossdocks in the OfficeMax network are smaller buildings where customer orders are sorted and loaded onto private fleet trucks for last mile delivery. The DC and crossdock facilities&#146; costs, including real estate, technology, labor and inventory, are allocated to the North American Retail Division and North American Business Solutions Division based on the relative services provided. 

Through the end of 2015, the integration of the companies has resulted in the closure of 8 DCs and crossdock facilities. In the next two years, we expect to integrate additional supply chain facilities by changing the warehouse inventory management system and expanding capacity to service both Office Depot and OfficeMax banner customers, create or repurpose some locations, and close some locations. 

Inventory is held in our DCs at levels we believe sufficient to meet current and anticipated customer needs. Certain purchases are sent directly from the manufacturer to our customers or retail stores. Some supply chain facilities and some retail locations also house sales offices, showrooms, and administrative offices supporting our contract sales channel. 

As of December 26, 2015, we operated 45 DC and crossdock facilities in the United States and Canada. Refer to Item 2. &#147;Properties&#148; for further information. 

Out-bound delivery and inbound direct import operations are currently provided by us and third-party carriers. 

International Division 

In recent years, the International Division has undergone significant restructuring activities, including disposing of assets and streamlining processes, primarily in Europe. In 2015, the Company substantially completed the European restructuring plan to realign the organization from a geographic-focus to a business channel-focus (the &#147;European Restructuring Plan&#148;). The restructuring plan includes the creation of centralized and standardized processes that operate across Europe. These activities have helped to lower operating expenses. Refer to Part II &#151; Item 7. &#147;MD&#38;A&#148; for further details on this plan. 

&#160; 

The International Division sells office products and services through direct mail catalogs, contract sales forces, Internet sites, retail stores, and to a lesser extent, through licensing, franchising, alliances and other arrangements. We also offer copy and print services to our customers in Europe through our e-commerce business and certain retail locations. Refer to the &#147;Merchandising&#148; section below for additional product information. 

As of December 26, 2015, the International Division sold to customers in 57 countries throughout Europe, Asia/Pacific, and Latin America, including wholly-owned operations in 17 countries and through licensing and franchise agreements, cross-border transactions, alliances and other arrangements in an additional 40 countries. Sales through delivery channels, including contract, call centers and the Internet are throughout the Division. Retail operations consisted of 147 stores in France, South Korea, Sweden, New Zealand, and Australia and participation under licensing and merchandise arrangements in certain countries in Latin America, Europe, and Asia. 

The Company maintains DCs and call centers throughout Europe and Asia/Pacific to support these operations. Refer to Part I &#151; Item 2. &#147;Properties&#148; for additional information on the International Division stores and DCs count and Part II &#151; Item 7. &#147;MD&#38;A&#148; for stores activity. 

The International Division has separate regional headquarters for Europe in The Netherlands and for Asia in Hong Kong. 

Merchandising 

Our merchandising strategy is to meet our customers&#146; needs by offering a broad selection of country and regional branded office products, as well as our own branded products and services. The selection of our own branded products has increased in breadth and level of sophistication over time. We currently offer products under various labels, including Office Depot &#174; , OfficeMax &#174; , Foray &#174; , Ativa &#174; , TUL &#174; , Realspace &#174; , WorkPro &#174; , Brenton Studio &#174; , Highmark &#174; , Grand &#38; Toy &#174; and Viking Office Products &#174; . 

We classify our products into three categories: (1) supplies, (2) technology, and (3) furniture and other. The supplies category includes products such as paper, binders, writing instruments, cleaning and breakroom items, and school supplies. The technology category includes products such as desktop and laptop computers, monitors, tablets, printers, ink and toner, cables, software, digital cameras, telephones, and wireless communications products, as well as services for technology products. The furniture and other category includes products such as desks, chairs, luggage, sales in our copy and print centers, and other miscellaneous items. 

Total Company sales by product group were as follows: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

* Amounts include the OfficeMax sales since November 5, 2013. We buy substantially all of our merchandise directly from manufacturers, industry wholesalers, and other primary suppliers, including direct sourcing of our own brands products from domestic and offshore sources. We also enter into arrangements with vendors that can lower our unit product costs if certain volume thresholds or other criteria are met. For additional discussion regarding these arrangements, refer to &#147;Critical Accounting Policies&#148; in Part II &#151; Item 7. &#147;MD&#38;A&#148;. 

&#160; 

We operate separate merchandising functions in North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific. Each group is responsible for selecting, purchasing and pricing merchandise as well as managing the product life cycle of our inventory. In recent years, we have increasingly used global offerings across all regions to further reduce our product cost while maintaining product quality. 

We operate a converged global sourcing office in Shenzhen, China, which allows us to better manage our product sourcing, logistics and quality assurance. This office consolidates our purchasing power with Asian factories and, in turn, helps us to increase the scope of our own branded offerings. 

Sales and Marketing 

As part of bringing Office Depot and OfficeMax together and setting a foundation for growth, the Company has invested significant effort to identify our customers&#146; needs, understand their preferences and develop strategies to meet their needs. This includes assessing consumer shopping needs and behaviors which will help refine our strategy to identify and offer desired product assortment, shopping environment and purchasing methods. This effort will help shape our business in future periods and may impact store and website design, product offerings and placement, promotional activity and customer contact methods. Identifying the most desirable and effective way to reach our customers and allowing them to shop through whichever channel they prefer will continue to be a priority in the future. 

Our marketing programs are designed to attract and retain customers, drive frequency of customer visits, and increase customers&#146; spend in our stores and websites. We regularly advertise in major newspapers in most of our North American markets. We also advertise through local and national radio, network and cable television advertising campaigns, and direct marketing efforts, such as the Internet and social networking. Our North American marketing programs are prepared on a combined banner basis. 

In early 2015, we combined the previously existing separate Office Depot and OfficeMax loyalty programs. Our customer loyalty program provides customers with rewards that can be applied to future purchases or other incentives. These programs enable us to market more effectively to our customers. Loyalty programs may change in popularity in the future, and we may make alterations to them from time to time. 

We perform periodic competitive pricing analyses to monitor each market, and prices are adjusted as necessary to further our competitive positioning. We generally target our everyday pricing to be competitive with other resellers of office products. 

We acquire new customers by selectively mailing specially designed catalogs and by making on-premises sales calls to prospective customers. We also make outbound sales calls using dedicated agents through our telephone account management program. We obtain the names of prospective customers in new and existing markets through the purchase of selected lists from outside marketing information services and other sources as well as through the use of a proprietary mailing list system. We also acquire customers through e-mail marketing campaigns and online affiliates. No single customer in any of our Divisions accounts for more than 10% of our total sales or accounts receivable. 

Our business is somewhat seasonal, with sales generally trending lower in the second quarter, following the &#147;back-to-business&#148; sales cycle in the first quarter and preceding the &#147;back-to-school&#148; sales cycle in the third quarter and the holiday sales cycle in the fourth quarter. Certain working capital components may build and recede during the year reflecting established selling cycles. Business cycles can and have impacted our operations and financial position when compared to other periods. 

With the exception of online purchases placed or fulfilled in our retail locations, online sales activities are reported in the North American Business Solutions or International Divisions, as appropriate. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

We currently operate under the Office Depot &#174; and OfficeMax &#174; brand names. We hold trademark registrations domestically and worldwide and have numerous other applications pending worldwide for the names &#147;Office Depot&#148;, &#147;Viking&#148;, &#147;Ativa&#148;, &#147;Foray&#148;, &#147;Realspace&#148;, &#147;OfficeMax&#148;, &#147;TUL&#148;, &#147;WorkPro&#148;, &#147;Brenton Studio&#148;, &#147;Highmark&#148; and others. As with all domestic trademarks, our trademark registrations in the United States are for a ten year period and are renewable every ten years, prior to their respective expirations, as long as the trademarks are used in the regular course of trade. We also hold issued patents and pending patent applications domestically and internationally for certain private brand products, such as shredders, binders, and writing instruments. 

Industry and Competition 

We operate in a highly competitive environment in all three Divisions. We compete with office supply stores, wholesale clubs, discount stores, mass merchandisers, Internet-based companies, food and drug stores, computer and electronics superstores and direct marketing companies. These companies compete with us in substantially all of our current markets. Increased competition in the office products markets, together with increased advertising, and Internet-based search tools, has heightened price awareness among end-users. Such heightened price awareness has led to margin pressure on office products and impacted our results. In addition to price, competition is also based on customer service, the quality and breadth of product selection and convenience. Other office supply retail companies market similarly to us in terms of store format, pricing strategy, product selection and product availability in the markets where we operate, primarily those in the United States. Some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources, which affords them greater purchasing power, increased financial flexibility and more capital resources for expansion and improvement, which may enable them to compete more effectively. We anticipate that in the future we will continue to face competition from these companies. 

We believe our customer service and the efficiency and convenience for our customers from our combined contract and retail distribution channels help our North American Business Solutions Division to compete with other business-to-business office products distributors. 

We believe our North American Retail Division segment competes based on the quality of our customer service, our store formats, the breadth and depth of our merchandise offering and our pricing. 

Internationally, we compete on a similar basis to North America. Our wholly-owned entities in the International Division sell through contract and catalog channels and operate retail stores in 17 countries. Additionally, our International Division provides office products and services in another 40 countries through licensing and franchise agreements, cross-border transactions, alliances and other arrangements. 

Employees 

As of January 23, 2016, we had approximately 49,000 employees worldwide. In certain international locations, changes in staffing or work arrangements may need approval of local works councils or other bodies. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

As both a significant user and seller of paper products, we have developed environmental practices that are values-based and market-driven. Our environmental initiatives center on three guiding principles: (1) recycling and pollution reduction; (2) sustainable forest management; and (3) issue awareness and market development for environmentally preferable products. We offer thousands of different products containing recycled content and technology recycling services. 

Office Depot continues to implement environmental programs in line with our stated environmental vision to &#147;increasingly buy green, be green and sell green&#148; &#151; including environmental sensitivity in our packaging, operations and sales offerings. Operations in the US and internationally have been commended for our leadership position for our facility design, recycling efforts, and &#145;green&#146; product offerings. Additional information on our achievements and green product offerings can be found at www.officedepotcitizenship.com/planet/ and www.officedepot.com/buygreen. 

We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations related to historical OfficeMax operations of paper and forest products businesses and timberland assets. We record environmental and asbestos liabilities, and accrue losses associated with these obligations, when probable and reasonably estimable. We record a separate insurance recovery receivable when considered probable. Refer to Item 3. &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; for additional information.
