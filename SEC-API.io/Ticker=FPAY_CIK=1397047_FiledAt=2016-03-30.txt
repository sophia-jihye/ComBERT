1. BUSINESS: 

&#160; 

FlexShopper Inc.(the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 16, 2006. The Company owns 100% of FlexShopper, LLC, a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of North Carolina on June 24, 2013. Since the sale of the assets of Anchor Funding Services LLC (&#8220;Anchor&#8221;), which sale was completed in a series of transactions between April and June 2014, the Company is a holding corporation with no operations except for those conducted by FlexShopper LLC. FlexShopper LLC provides through e-commerce sites, certain types of durable goods to consumers on a lease-to-own basis (&#8220;LTO&#8221;) including consumers of third party retailers and e-tailers. 

&#160; 

In January 2015, in connection with the credit agreement entered into in March 2015, (see Note 6) FlexShopper 1 LLC and FlexShopper 2 LLC were organized as wholly owned Delaware subsidiaries of FlexShopper LLC to conduct operations. FlexShopper LLC together with its subsidiaries is hereafter referred to as &#8220;FlexShopper.&#8221; 

&#160; 

During 2013, the Company decided to concentrate its efforts on the operations of FlexShopper and subsequently, an agreement was entered into with a financial institution to sell substantially all of the operating assets of Anchor which provided accounts receivable funding to businesses located throughout the United States. The sale was finalized in June 2014 (see Note 3). The consolidated statements of operations and cash flows reflect the historical operations of Anchor as discontinued operations. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 reflects amounts attributable to Anchor as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations. We have generally presented the notes to our consolidated financial statements on the basis of continuing operations. 

&#160; 

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

&#160; 

Principles of Consolidation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. 

&#160; 

Estimates &#8211; The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

&#160; 

Revenue Recognition - Merchandise is leased to customers pursuant to lease purchase agreements which provide for weekly lease terms with non-refundable lease payments. Generally the customer has the right to acquire title either through a 90 day same as cash option, an early purchase option, or through payments of all required lease payments, generally 52 weeks, for ownership. On any current lease, customers have the option to cancel the agreement in accordance with lease terms and return the merchandise. Accordingly, customer agreements are accounted for as operating leases with lease revenues recognized in the month they are due on the accrual basis of accounting. Merchandise sales revenue is recognized when the customer exercises the purchase option and pays the purchase price. Revenue from processing fees earned upon exercise by the customer of the 90 day purchase option is recorded upon recognition of the related merchandise sales. These fees amounted to approximately $104,900 and $38,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively. Revenue for lease payments received prior to their due date is deferred and recognized as revenue in the period to which the payments relate. Revenues from leases and sales are reported net of sales taxes. 

&#160; 

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts &#8211; FlexShopper seeks to collect amounts owed under its leases from each customer on a weekly basis by charging their bank account or credit card. Accounts receivable are principally comprised of lease payments currently owed to FlexShopper which are past due as FlexShopper has been unable to successfully collect in the manner described above. An allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated by providing an allowance for all accounts in excess of four payments in arrears, adjusted for subsequent collections. The accounts receivable balances consisted of the following as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; December 31, 2015 &#160; &#160; December 31, 2014 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Accounts receivable &#160; $ 5,479,437 &#160; &#160; $ 1,509,736 &#160; Allowance for doubtful accounts &#160; &#160; 4,727,278 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,380,902 &#160; Accounts receivable, net &#160; $ 752,159 &#160; &#160; $ 128,834 &#160; &#160;

26&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The allowance is a significant percentage of the balance because FlexShopper does not charge off any customer accounts until it has exhausted all collection efforts with respect to each account including attempts to repossess items. In addition, while collections are pursued, the same delinquent customers will continue to accrue weekly charges until they are charged off. During the year ended December 31, 2015, $2,300,708 of accounts receivable balances were charged off against the allowance. 

&#160; 

Lease Merchandise &#8211; Until all payment obligations for ownership are satisfied under the lease agreement, the Company maintains ownership of the lease merchandise. Lease merchandise consists primarily of residential furniture, consumer electronics, computers, appliances and household accessories and is recorded at cost net of accumulated depreciation. The Company depreciates leased merchandise using the straight line method over the applicable agreement period for a consumer to acquire ownership, generally twelve months with no salvage value. Upon transfer of ownership of merchandise to customers resulting from satisfaction of their lease obligations, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from lease merchandise. For lease merchandise returned or anticipated to be returned either voluntarily or through repossession, the Company provides an impairment reserve for the undepreciated balance of the merchandise net of any estimated salvage value with a corresponding charge to cost of lease revenue. The cost, accumulated depreciation and impairment reserve related to such merchandise are written off upon determination that no salvage value is obtainable. The impairment charge amounted to approximately $1,500,000 and $527,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively. The net leased merchandise balances consisted of the following as of December 31, 2015 and 2014: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; December 31, 2015 &#160; &#160; December 31, 2014 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Lease merchandise at cost &#160; $ 19,504,645 &#160; &#160; $ 6,929,509 &#160; Accumulated depreciation &#160; &#160; 7,473,363 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,160,591 &#160; Impairment reserve &#160; &#160; 827,146 &#160; &#160; &#160; 527,000 &#160; Lease merchandise, net &#160; $ 11,204,136 &#160; &#160; $ 4,241,918 &#160; &#160; 

Cost of lease merchandise sold represents the undepreciated cost of rental merchandise at the time of sale. 

&#160; 

Deferred Debt Issuance Costs &#8211; Debt issuance costs incurred in conjunction with the Credit Agreement entered into on March 6, 2015 (see Note 6) are offset against the outstanding balance of the loan payable and are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining term of the credit facility. Amortization for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $487,709. 

&#160; 

27&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Intangible Assets &#8211; Intangible assets consist of a pending patent on the Company&#8217;s LTO payment method at check-out for third party e-commerce sites. Patents are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Patent costs are amortized by using the straight line method over the legal life, or if shorter, the useful life of the patent which has been estimated to be 10 years. The net patent cost balances consisted of the following as of December 31, 2015 and 2014: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; December 31, 2015 &#160; &#160; December 31, 2014 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Patent costs &#160; $ 30,760 &#160; &#160; $ 30,760 &#160; Accumulated amortization &#160; &#160; 7,344 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4,268 &#160; Patent costs, net &#160; $ 23,416 &#160; &#160; $ 26,492 &#160; &#160; 

Software Costs - Costs related to developing or obtaining internal-use software incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages of an internal use software project are expensed as incurred and certain costs incurred in the project&#8217;s application development stage are capitalized as property and equipment. The Company expenses costs related to the planning and operating stages of a website. Costs associated with minor enhancements and maintenance for the website are included in expenses as incurred. Direct costs incurred in the website&#8217;s development stage are capitalized as property and equipment. Capitalized software costs amounted to $1,142,922 and $1,017,104 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively. 

&#160; 

Operating Expenses &#8211; Operating expenses include all corporate overhead expenses such as salaries, payroll taxes and benefits, stock based compensation, occupancy, marketing costs, advertising and other administrative expenses. &#160; 

&#160;

Marketing costs are charged to expense as incurred. Total marketing costs which primarily consist of advertising were approximately $4,395,000 and $885,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively. 

&#160; 

Per Share Data &#8211; Per share data is computed by use of the two-class method as a result of outstanding convertible preferred stock which participates in dividends with the common stock and accordingly has participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the period (see Note 7). Under such method where the Company has undistributed net income, basic earnings per common share is computed based on the total of any dividends paid per common share plus undistributed income per common share determined by dividing net income reduced by any dividends paid on common and preferred stock by the total of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the weighted average number of common shares issuable upon conversion of outstanding preferred stock during the period. Where the Company has a net loss, basic per share data (including income from continuing operations) is computed based solely on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. As the convertible preferred stock has no contractual obligation to share in the losses of the Company, common shares issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock are not included in such computations. 

&#160; 

Diluted earnings per share is based on the more dilutive of the if-converted method (which assumes conversion of the preferred stock as of the beginning of the period) or the two-class method (which assumes that the preferred stock is not converted) plus the potential impact of dilutive options and warrants. The dilutive effect of stock options and warrants is computed using the treasury stock method, which assumes the repurchase of common shares at the average market price during the period. Under the treasury stock method, options and warrants will have a dilutive effect when the average price of common stock during the period exceeds the exercise price of options or warrants. When there is a loss from continuing operations, potential common shares are not included in the computation of diluted loss per share, since they have an anti-dilutive effect. 

&#160; 

In computing diluted loss per share, no effect has been given to the issuance of common stock upon conversion or exercise of the following securities as their effect is anti-dilutive: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; Twelve months ended &#160; &#160; &#160; December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; Convertible preferred stock &#160; &#160; 2,077,487 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,984,870 &#160; Options &#160; &#160; 4,067,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,755,000 &#160; Warrants &#160; &#160; 5,115,531 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,115,531 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 11,260,018 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10,855,401 &#160; &#160; 

28&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Stock Based Compensation - The fair value of transactions in which the Company exchanges its equity instruments for employee services (share-based payment transactions) is recognized as an expense in the financial statements as services are performed. 

&#160; 

Compensation expense is determined by reference to the fair value of an award on the date of grant and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. We have elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) pricing model to determine the fair value of all stock option awards. See Note 8. 

&#160; 

Income Taxes &#8211; Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates. The Company records a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when management concludes that it is not more likely than not that such assets will be recognized. 

&#160; 

The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company has not recorded any unrecognized tax benefits. 

&#160; 

Interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions will be charged to interest and operating expenses, respectively. 

&#160; 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements &#8211; 

&#160; 

In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standard Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) ASU No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. ASU No. 2014-08 changes the definition of a discontinued operation to include only those disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. ASU No. 2014-08 is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2014 with early adoption permitted. The Company has early adopted this update in the second quarter of 2014. 

&#160; 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This new standard provides guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of revenue resulting from contracts with customers and will supersede virtually all of the current revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted for fiscal years and interim periods within these years beginning after December 15, 2016, the original date of the standard. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard on its financial statements. 

&#160; 

In June 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period. ASU 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the potential impacts of the new standard on its existing stock-based compensation plans. 

29&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements&#8212;Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. In connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, an entity&#8217;s management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Management&#8217;s evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are issued. Substantial doubt about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The term probable is used consistently with its use in Topic 450, Contingencies. The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. 

&#160; 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest &#8211; Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and for interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2015-03 during the quarter ended March 31, 2015. In the accompanying balance sheet at December 31, 2015, the Company offset $832,792 of unamortized debt issuance costs related to debt issued under the Credit Agreement in March 2015 against the outstanding balance of loans payable under the Credit Agreement. 

&#160; 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (ASU 2015-11) which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 defines net realizable value as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the new guidance will have on its financial statements. 

&#160; 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes- Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. 

&#160;

To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this ASU require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. 

&#160; 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. Under ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize for all leases at the commencement date a lease liability, which is a lessee&#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis, and a right-to-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee&#8217;s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on its financial statements.

3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS: 

&#160; 

During 2013, the Company decided to concentrate its efforts on the operations of FlexShopper and subsequently on April 30, 2014, Anchor entered into an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with a Bank, pursuant to which Anchor sold to the Bank substantially all of its assets (the &#8220;Anchor Assets&#8221;), consisting primarily of its factoring portfolio (the &#8220;Portfolio Accounts&#8221;). The purchase price for the Anchor Assets was equal to (1) approximately $4,445,000 which represented 110% of the total funds outstanding associated with the Portfolio Accounts which resulted in a gain of approximately $445,000 plus (2) an amount equal to 50% of the factoring fee and interest income earned by the Portfolio Accounts during the 12 month period following acquisition (&#8220;Earnout Payments&#8221;). The Earnout Payments totaled $342,541 for the period from July 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 and $206,177 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The sale of the Anchor Assets was made in a series of closings through September 16, 2014. In connection with each closing, Anchor used the proceeds thereof to pay the Bank all amounts due for factor advances associated with the Portfolio Accounts acquired pursuant to such closing under Anchor&#8217;s Rediscount Facility Agreement with the Bank dated November 30, 2011 (the &#8220;Rediscount Facility Agreement&#8221;). In accordance with the Purchase Agreement, following the final closing thereunder all obligations of Anchor under the Rediscount Facility Agreement (and the associated Validity Warranty) were paid and satisfied in full and the agreement was terminated. In the year ended December 31, 2014, Anchor recorded a gain of $788,015 on the sale of these assets including the earnout payments received through December 31, 2014. In the year ended December 31, 2015, Anchor recorded a gain of $206,177 for the earnout payments received during the period. All such gains are included in income from discontinued operations. 

&#160;

On October 22, 2010, Anchor filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Stamford/Norwalk, Connecticut against the Administrators of the Estate of David Harvey (&#8220;Harvey&#8221;) to recoup a credit loss incurred by the Company&#8217;s former subsidiary, Brookridge Funding Services, LLC. Harvey was the owner of a company that caused the credit loss and the Company is pursuing its rights under the personal guarantee that Harvey provided. The Complaint is demanding principal of approximately $485,000 plus interest and damages. On September 9, 2014, the Company received $124,774 from Harvey as a final settlement, which is included in discontinued operations. 

&#160; 

The assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations are presented separately under the captions &#8220;Assets of discontinued operations&#8221; and &#8220;Liabilities of discontinued operations&#8221; in the accompanying consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014 and consist of the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; December 31, 2014 &#160; Assets of discontinued operations: &#160; &#160; &#160; Retained interest in purchased accounts receivable &#160; $ 6,500 &#160; Liabilities of discontinued operations: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Accounts payable &#160; $ 7,626 &#160; &#160;

Depreciation and amortization expense was $582,257 and $162,210 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

5. LOANS PAYABLE SHAREHOLDERS: 

&#160; 

On March 19, 2014, upon approval of the Board of Directors, FlexShopper entered into two Promissory Notes totaling $1,000,000, one with former CEO Morry Rubin and the other with a major shareholder and Director of the Company. Each demand Promissory Note was for $500,000 and earned interest (payable monthly) at 10% per annum. The Promissory Notes were to assist FlexShopper in purchasing merchandise for lease to support FlexShopper&#8217;s growth. In May 2014, these loans were converted into shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock at a price of $0.55 per share (Note 6). In connection therewith accrued interest amounting to approximately $4,900 was contributed to capital. On December 8, 2014, upon approval of the Board of Directors, FlexShopper entered into a promissory note for $1,000,000, with a shareholder and executive of the Company. The note is payable on demand. The note was funded in increments of $500,000 on December 8 th and 18 th and earned interest at 15% per annum. The Promissory Note was to assist FlexShopper in purchasing merchandise for lease and was paid in full with interest amounting to $36,250 on March 11, 2015. 

&#160; 

6. LOAN PAYABLE 

&#160; 

On March 6, 2015, FlexShopper entered into a credit agreement (the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as paying agent, various lenders from time to time party thereto and WE 2014-1 LLC as administrative agent and lender, &#8220;Lender&#8221;. FlexShopper is permitted to borrow funds under the Credit Agreement based on FlexShopper&#8217;s cash on hand and the Amortized Order Value of its Eligible Leases (as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement) less certain deductions described in the Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, FlexShopper may borrow up to $25,000,000 from the Lender for a term of two years. The borrowing term may be extended for an additional twelve months at the sole discretion of the Lender. The Credit Agreement contemplates that the Lender may provide additional debt financing to FlexShopper, up to $100 million in total, under two uncommitted accordions following satisfaction of certain covenants and other terms and conditions. The Lender receives security interests in certain leases as collateral under the Credit Agreement. Amounts borrowed bear interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 15% per annum and a small non-usage fee is assessed on any undrawn amount if the facility is less than 80% drawn on average in any given measurement period commencing three months after closing of the facility. Interest is payable monthly on the outstanding balance of amounts borrowed and commencing on and after March 6, 2017, principal together with interest thereon, is payable monthly through March 6, 2018, the maturity date of the loan. Interest expense incurred under the Credit Agreement amounted to $407,110 during 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the amount funded under the agreement was $9,619,563.

&#160;

The Credit Agreement provides that FlexShopper may not incur additional indebtedness (other than expressly permitted indebtedness) without the permission of the Lender and also prohibits dividends on common stock. The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including, among others, failures to make payment of principal and interest, breaches or defaults under the terms of the Credit Agreement and related agreements entered into with the Lender, breaches of representations, warranties or certifications made by or on behalf of FlexShopper in the Credit Agreement and related documents (including certain financial and expense covenants), deficiencies in the borrowing base, certain judgments against FlexShopper and bankruptcy events. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter during the term of the agreement minimum amounts of Unrestricted Cash and Equity Book Value and to achieve Adjusted Operating Cash Flow of not less than certain amounts during such quarters (all such terms as defined in the Credit Agreement). As of December 31, 2015, the Company was in violation of the covenant requiring an Equity Book Value of at least $7.0 million as of such date. The covenant also requires the Company and its subsidiaries maintain an Equity Book Value of at least $7 million at each of March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2016 increasing to $10 million at the end of each quarter from March 31 through December 31, 2017. 

&#160; 

On February 11, 2016, FlexShopper entered into a third amendment, (the &#8220;Third Amendment&#8221;) to the Credit Agreement which amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, add a new financial covenant requiring FlexShopper to maintain at least $1,500,000 in Unrestricted Cash at all times. 

&#160; 

The Third Amendment also includes a consent by the Lender to a $1,000,000 promissory note (the &#8220;Promissory Note&#8221;) in favor of Marc Malaga, FlexShopper&#8217;s Executive Vice President of Operations. Interest on the Promissory Note accrues at the rate of 15.0% per annum and all outstanding principal and accrued interest is payable on demand by Mr. Malaga. The Promissory Note is secured by substantially all of FlexShopper&#8217;s assets. 

&#160; 

On March 29, 2016, FlexShopper entered into a fourth amendment to the Credit Agreement whereby the Lender waived the violation of the Equity Book Value covenant at December 31, 2015, as well as compliance with financial covenants (other than the unrestricted cash covenant) through the earlier of April 1, 2017 or the completion of the raising of at least $10,000,000 in equity funding. In addition, the amendment, among other things, provided that FlexShopper maintain Unrestricted Cash of at least $500,000 on each day and $1,000,000 at the end of each calendar month.

&#160;

7. CAPITAL STRUCTURE: 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s capital structure consists of preferred and common stock as described below: 

&#160; 

Preferred Stock &#8211; The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of $.001 par value preferred stock. The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors determines the rights and preferences of its preferred stock. 

&#160; 

On January 31, 2007, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of Delaware. Effective with this filing, 2,000,000 preferred shares became Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock. Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to Common Stock. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2014, each share of Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock was convertible into 5.8 shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock, subject to certain anti-dilution rights. As a result of the Company entering into the Credit Agreement (see Note 6) and the related sale of common stock referred to below, each share of Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock became convertible into 6.33 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. The holder of the Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock has the option to convert the shares to Common Stock at any time. Upon conversion all accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, will be paid as additional shares of Common Stock. The holders of Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock have the same dividend rights as holders of Common Stock, as if the Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock had been converted to Common Stock. 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2014, 34,168 preferred shares were converted into 194,758 common shares. During the year ended December 31, 2015, 14,022 preferred shares were converted into 88,759 common shares. As of December 31, 2015 there were 328,197 shares of Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding which are convertible into 2,077,487 shares of common stock. 

&#160; 

Common Stock &#8211; The Company, which was authorized to issue 65,000,000 shares of $.0001 par value Common Stock, after obtaining stockholder approval and filing an amendment to the Company&#8217;s Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, increased its authorized shares to 100 million in September 2015. Each share of Common Stock entitles the holder to one vote at all stockholder meetings.

&#160;

33&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

From May through October 2014, the Company received gross proceeds of $6,501,100 from the sale of 11,820,187 shares offered through three co-placement agents in a private placement offering at an offering price of $.55 per share under Rule 506 and/or Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended. In connection therewith seven year warrants to purchase 1,773,027 common shares at an exercise price of $0.55 per share were issued to placement agents. 

&#160; 

In addition, pursuant to the terms of the private placement offering, George Rubin and Morry F. Rubin, officers, directors and founders of the Company, each completed the funding of their $500,000 loan to the Company and converted these loans into shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock at the same offering price per share as that paid by investors in the offering. An aggregate of 1,818,182 shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock were issued to the Rubins from the conversion of their notes totaling $1,000,000. 

&#160; 

In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, on March 6, 2015, FlexShopper raised approximately $8.6 million in net proceeds through direct sales of 17.0 million shares of FlexShopper common stock, to certain affiliates of the Lender and other accredited investors for a purchase price of $0.55 per share. As a result of the sale to certain affiliates, the Lender is considered a beneficial shareholder of the Company. 

&#160; 

8. STOCK OPTIONS 

&#160; 

On January 31, 2007, the Board of Directors adopted the 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;), with 2,100,000 common shares authorized for issuance under the Plan. In October 2009, the Company's stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares covered by the Plan to 4,200,000 shares. Grants under the plan may consist of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, stock unit awards, dividend equivalents and other stock based awards. In September 2015, the stockholders approved the 2015 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan which has terms identical to the 2007 Plan and provided for the issuance of 4,000,000 common shares. As of December 31, 2015, there were 4,133,000 common shares available for issuance under the plans. 

&#160; 

Employees, directors and consultants and other service providers are eligible to participate in the Plan. Options granted under the plan vest over periods ranging from immediately upon grant to a three year period and expire ten years from date of grant. 

&#160; 

Activity in stock options for the year ended December 31, 2015 follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; Number of shares &#160; &#160; Weighted average exercise price &#160; &#160; Weighted average contractual term &#160; &#160; Aggregate intrinsic value &#160; Outstanding at January 1, 2015 &#160; &#160; 3,755,000 &#160; &#160; $ 0.87 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Granted &#160; &#160; 527,000 &#160; &#160; $ 0.68 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Canceled &#160; &#160; (215,000 ) &#160; 0.81 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Outstanding at December 31, 2015 &#160; &#160; 4,067,000 &#160; &#160; $ 0.85 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4.72 &#160; &#160; $ 257,150 &#160; Vested and exercisable at December 31, 2015 &#160; &#160; 3,543,997 &#160; &#160; $ 0.88 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4.05 &#160; &#160; $ 232,833 &#160; Vested and exercisable at December 31, 2015 and expected to vest thereafter &#160; &#160; 4,014,700 &#160; &#160; $ 0.88 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4.72 &#160; &#160; $ 254,718 &#160; &#160; 

34&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during 2014 and 2015 was $0.06 and $0.01 per share respectively. The Company measured the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model (BSM) with the following assumptions: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; Exercise price &#160; $ 0.75 to $0.90 &#160; &#160; $ 0.60 to $0.90 &#160; Expected life &#160; &#160; 6 years &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 years &#160; Expected volatility &#160; &#160; 37 % &#160; &#160; 35 % Dividend yield &#160; &#160; 0 % &#160; &#160; 0 % Risk-free interest rate &#160; &#160; 1.64% to 2.70 % &#160; &#160; 1.35% to 2.70 % &#160; 

The expected dividend yield is based on the Company&#8217;s historical dividend yield. The expected volatility was based on the average of historical volatilities for a period comparable to the expected life of the options of certain entities considered to be similar to the Company. The expected life is based on the simplified expected term calculation permitted by the SEC which defines the expected life as the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted-average vesting period for all option tranches. The risk-free interest rate is based on the annual yield on the grant date of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond the maturity of which equals the option&#8217;s expected life. 

&#160;

The value of stock options is recognized as compensation expense by the straight line method over the vesting period. Compensation expense recorded for options in the statements of operations was $78,600 and $299,700 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested options at December 31, 2015 amounted to $121,400 which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.1 years. 

&#160;

9. WARRANTS: &#160; 

&#160;

On January 31, 2014, the expiration date of outstanding warrants issued to one of the Company&#8217;s placement agents to purchase 1,342,500 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock at $1.10 per share, was extended by the Company through January 31, 2018. The following information was input into the BSM to compute a fair value price of $.104 for each modified warrant: 

&#160; 

Exercise price &#160; $ 1.10 &#160; Term &#160; &#160; 4 years &#160; Expected volatility &#160; &#160; 37 % Dividend yield &#160; &#160; 0 % Risk-free interest rate &#160; &#160; .09 % &#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2014, compensation expense of $139,620 was recorded related to these warrants. 

&#160; 

The following table summarizes information about outstanding stock warrants as of December 31, 2015 all of which are exercisable: 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Weighted Average &#160; Exercise &#160; &#160; Number &#160; &#160; Remaining &#160; Price &#160; &#160; Outstanding &#160; &#160; Contractual Life &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 1.10 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,342,500 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 years &#160; &#160; 1.00 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,000,004 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 years &#160; $ 0.55 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,773,027 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 years &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,115,531 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160; 

10. INCOME TAXES: 

&#160; 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the income tax benefit allocated to continuing operations represents the tax benefit from utilizing the loss from continuing operations to offset income from discontinued operations. A corresponding tax provision was charged to discontinued operations. 

&#160; 

Reconciliation of the benefit for income taxes from continuing operations recorded in the consolidated statement of operations with the amounts computed at the statutory federal tax rate of 34% as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Federal tax benefit at statutory rate &#160; $ (3,059,000 ) &#160; $ (1,657,000 ) State tax benefit, net of federal tax &#160; &#160; (436,000 ) &#160; &#160; (61,000 ) Permanent differences &#160; &#160; (14,000 ) &#160; &#160; (38,000 &#160; Change in statutory rate &#160; &#160; (133,000 ) &#160; &#160; - &#160; Increase in valuation allowance &#160; &#160; 3,564,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,298,000 &#160; Benefit for income taxes &#160; $ (78,000 ) &#160; $ (458,000 ) &#160; 

Tax affected components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; Deferred tax assets: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Equity based compensation &#160; $ 266,000 &#160; &#160; $ 229,000 &#160; Allowance for doubtful accounts &#160; &#160; 1,844,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 552,000 &#160; Lease merchandise &#160; &#160; 1,139,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 582,000 &#160; Net operating loss carry-forwards &#160; &#160; 3,354,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,680,000 &#160; Other &#160; &#160; 12,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross deferred tax assets &#160; &#160; 6,615,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,043,000 &#160; Valuation allowance &#160; &#160; (6,606,000 ) &#160; &#160; (3,042,000 ) Net deferred tax assets &#160; &#160; 9,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,000 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Fixed assets &#160; &#160; (9,000 ) &#160; &#160; (1,000 ) &#160; &#160; $ - &#160; &#160; $ - &#160; &#160; 

Based on consideration of the available evidence including historical losses a valuation allowance has been recognized to offset deferred tax assets, as management was unable to conclude that realization of deferred tax assets were more likely than not. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company has federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $8,400,000 and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $5,180,000 available to offset future taxable income which expire from 2021 to 2035. 

&#160; 

Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a limitation on a corporation's ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards (&#8220;NOLs&#8221;) if it experiences an &#8220;ownership change.&#8221; In general, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. The Company has not performed a formal Section 382 study. If such a change were to occur, certain NOLs available to be used could be disallowed and an annual limitation on utilization of other NOLs would occur. 

&#160; 

36&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company files tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states. At December 31, 2015, federal tax returns remained open for Internal Revenue Service review for tax years after 2011, while state tax returns remain open for review by state taxing authorities for tax years after 2010. There were no federal or state income tax audits being conducted as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160;

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 

&#160; 

Not applicable. 

&#160; 

Item 9.A Controls and Procedures. 

&#160; 

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2015 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and that material information relating to the Company is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. &#160; 

&#160; 

Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

&#160; 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company&#8217;s management and board of directors regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: maintain records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; provide reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 

&#160; 

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent auditors have not audited and are not required to audit this assessment of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

&#160;

Amendment No. 4 to Credit Agreement and Waiver 

&#160;

On March 29, 2016, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary (the &#8220;Borrower&#8221;), entered into a fourth amendment and waiver (the &#8220;Fourth Amendment&#8221;) to the Credit Agreement originally entered into on March 6, 2015 (the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) by and among the Borrower and WE 2014-1, LLC, an affiliate of Waterfall Asset Management, LLC, and certain other lenders thereunder from time to time.

Corporate Governance 

&#160; 

Our business, property and affairs are managed by, or under the direction of, our Board, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and our Bylaws. Members of the Board are kept informed of our business through discussions with the Chief Executive Officer and other key members of management, by reviewing materials provided to them by management. 

&#160; 

We continue to review our corporate governance policies and practices by comparing our policies and practices with those suggested by various groups or authorities active in evaluating or setting best practices for corporate governance of public companies. Based on this review, we have adopted, and will continue to adopt, changes that the Board believes are necessary or advisable to implement the appropriate corporate governance policies and practices for our Company. We have adopted changes and will continue to adopt changes, as appropriate, to comply with federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and subsequent rule changes made by the SEC and any applicable securities exchange. 

&#160; 

Director Qualifications and Diversity 

&#160; 

The Board seeks independent directors who represent a diversity of backgrounds and experiences that will enhance the quality of the Board&#8217;s deliberations and decisions. Candidates shall have substantial experience with one or more publicly traded companies or shall have achieved a high level of distinction in their chosen fields. The Board is particularly interested in maintaining a composition that includes individuals who are active or retired executive officers and senior executives, particularly those with experience in the finance and capital markets industries. In evaluating nominations to the Board of Directors, our Board also looks for certain personal attributes, such as integrity, ability and willingness to apply sound and independent business judgment, comprehensive understanding of a director&#8217;s role in corporate governance, availability for meetings and consultation on Company matters, and the willingness to assume and carry out fiduciary responsibilities. Qualified candidates for membership on the Board will be considered without regard to race, color, religion, sex, ancestry, national origin or disability. 

&#160; 

Risk Oversight 

Enterprise risks are identified and prioritized by management and each prioritized risk is assigned to the full Board for oversight. These risks include, without limitation, the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; risks and exposures associated with strategic, financial and execution risks and other current matters that may present material risk to our operations, plans, prospects or reputation; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; risks and exposures associated with financial matters, particularly financial reporting, tax, accounting, disclosure, internal control over financial reporting, financial policies, investment guidelines and credit and liquidity matters; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; risks and exposures relating to corporate governance, and management and director succession planning; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; risks and exposures associated with leadership assessment, and compensation programs and arrangements, including incentive plans. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Board Leadership Structure 

&#160; 

We currently have a Chairman of the Board who presides at all meetings of the Board. The Chairman is appointed on an annual basis by at least a majority vote of the remaining directors. Currently, Mr. Bernstein serves as the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. FlexShopper has no fixed policy with respect to the separation of the offices of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Our bylaws permit these positions to be held by the same person, and the Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company to retain flexibility in determining whether to separate or combine the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer based on our circumstances. The Board has determined that it is appropriate for Mr. Bernstein to serve as both Chairman and Chief Executive Officer because combining the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (1) enhances the alignment between the Board and management in strategic planning and execution as well as operational matters, (2) avoids the confusion over roles, responsibilities and authority that can result from separating the positions, and (3) streamlines board process in order to conserve time for the consideration of the important matters the Board needs to address. 

&#160; 

Limitation of Directors&#8217; Liability and Indemnification 

&#160; 

Our directors are not personally liable to us or to any of our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director except for liability (i) for any breach of the director&#8217;s duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived any improper personal benefit. If the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any other statute of the State of Delaware is amended to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of our directors, then the liability of our directors will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by the statutes of the State of Delaware, as so amended, and such elimination or limitation of liability shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the provided limitation on the liability of a director. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we fully indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative) by reason of the fact that such person is or was our director or officer, or is or was serving at our request as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys&#8217; fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding. To the extent permitted by law, we may fully indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative) by reason of the fact that such person is or was our employee or agent, or is or was serving at our request as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys&#8217; fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding. We will, if so requested by a director or officer, advance expenses (including attorneys&#8217; fees) incurred by such director or officer in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon the receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to indemnification.

&#160;

(1) Topic 718 requires FlexShopper to determine the overall full grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards and options as of the date of grant based upon the Black-Scholes method of valuation which total amounts are set forth in the table above under the year of grant, and to then expense that value over the service period over which the restricted stock awards and options become vested. As a general rule, for time-in-service-based restricted stock awards and options, FlexShopper will immediately expense any restricted stock awards and option or portion thereof which is vested upon grant, while expensing the balance on a pro rata basis over the remaining vesting term of the restricted stock awards and options. For a description Topic 718 and the assumptions used in determining the value of the restricted stock awards and options under the Black-Scholes model of valuation, see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included with this Form 10-K. &#160; 

(2) Includes all other compensation not reported in the preceding columns, including (i) perquisites and other personal benefits, or property, unless the aggregate amount of such compensation is less than $10,000; (ii) all &#8220;gross-ups&#8221; or other amounts reimbursed during the fiscal year for the payment of taxes; (iii) the compensation costs of any discounts from market price with respect to securities purchased from FlexShopper except to the extent available generally to all security holders or to all salaried employees; (iv) any amounts paid or accrued pursuant to a plan or arrangement in connection with any termination (including without limitation through retirement, resignation, severance or constructive termination, including change of responsibilities) or change in control; (v) contributions or other allocations to vested and unvested defined contribution plans; (vi) the dollar value of any insurance premiums paid by, or on behalf of, FlexShopper relating to life insurance for the benefit of the named executive officer; and (vii) the value of any dividends or other earnings paid on stock or option awards that are not factored into the grant date fair value required to be reported in a preceding column. &#160;

(1) Topic 718 requires FlexShopper to determine the overall full grant date fair market value of the restricted stock awards and the options as of the date of grant based upon the Black-Scholes method of valuation which total amounts are set forth in the table above under the year of grant, and to then expense that value over the service period over which the restricted stock awards and the options become exercisable vested. As a general rule, for time-in-service-based restricted stock awards and options, FlexShopper will immediately expense any restricted stock award or option or portion thereof which is vested upon grant, while expensing the balance on a pro rata basis over the remaining vesting term of the restricted stock award and option. For a description of Topic 718 and the assumptions used in determining the value of the restricted stock awards and options under the Black-Scholes model of valuation, see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein. &#160; 

(2) Includes all other compensation not reported in the preceding columns, including (i) perquisites and other personal benefits, or property, unless the aggregate amount of such compensation is less than $10,000; (ii) any &#8220;gross-ups&#8221; or other amounts reimbursed during the fiscal year for the payment of taxes; (iii) discounts from market price with respect to securities purchased from FlexShopper except to the extent available generally to all security holders or to all salaried employees; (iv) any amounts paid or accrued in connection with any termination (including without limitation through retirement, resignation, severance or constructive termination, including change of responsibilities) or change in control; (v) contributions to vested and unvested defined contribution plans; (vi) any insurance premiums paid by, or on behalf of, FlexShopper relating to life insurance for the benefit of the director; (vii) any consulting fees earned, or paid or payable; (viii) any annual costs of payments and promises of payments pursuant to a director legacy program and similar charitable awards program; and (ix) any dividends or other earnings paid on stock or option awards that are not factored into the grant date fair value required to be reported in a preceding column. &#160;

&#160; 

Indemnification; Director and Officer Liability Insurance 

&#160; 

FlexShopper has agreed to indemnify (and advance the costs of defense of) each director (and his legal representatives) to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the state in which FlexShopper is incorporated, as in effect at the time of the subject act or omission, or by the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of FlexShopper, whichever affords greater protection to each director, and both during and after termination (for any reason). FlexShopper shall cause each director to be covered under a directors and officers' liability insurance policy for his acts (or non-acts) as an officer or director of FlexShopper or any of its affiliates. Such policy shall be maintained by FlexShopper at its expense in an amount of at least $5 million during the term each director serves FlexShopper (including the time period of coverage after each director&#8217;s service terminates for any reason whatsoever). In the event of any litigation or other proceeding between FlexShopper and a director with respect to enforcement of a director&#8217;s rights to indemnification and director and officer liability insurance and such litigation or proceeding results in final judgment or order in favor of the Director, which judgment or order is substantially inconsistent with the positions asserted by FlexShopper in such litigation or proceeding, the losing party shall reimburse the prevailing party for all of his/its reasonable costs and expenses relating to such litigation or other proceeding, including, without limitation, his/its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. 

&#160; 

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. 

&#160; 

As of March 19, 2016, we have 52,104,081 shares of Common Stock and 328,197 shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. In this respect, each one share of Series 1 Preferred Stock has the voting rights of 5.7877 shares of Common Stock, but is convertible into 6.33 shares of Common Stock. Accordingly, the 328,197 shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock are convertible into 2,077,487 shares of Common Stock with the equivalent voting rights of 1,899,506 shares of Common Stock. The following table sets forth information regarding the economic ownership of our company Common Stock by:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; each person or group of affiliated persons who is known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our Common Stock; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; each of our executive officers included in the Summary Compensation Table; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; each of our directors; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; all executive officers and directors as a group. &#160;

52&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Beneficial ownership is determined based on the rules and regulations of the SEC. A person has beneficial ownership of shares if the individual has the power to vote and/or dispose of shares. This power can be sole or shared, and direct or indirect. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of Common Stock subject to options held by that person are counted as outstanding in such cases where the option holder may exercise the options within 60 days of the date hereof. These shares, however, are not counted as outstanding for the purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Except as indicated in the footnotes to the table below, each person named in the table has sole voting and dispositive power with respect to the shares set forth opposite that person&#8217;s name. (Note: All addresses of the Company&#8217;s officers and directors and Marc Malaga are c/o FlexShopper, Inc. at 2700 North Military Trail, Ste. 200, Boca Raton, FL 33431.)

2015 Credit and Equity Financings 

&#160;

On March 6, 2015, FlexShopper, entered into a credit agreement (the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) among FlexShopper 2, LLC (&#8220;Borrower&#8221;), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, various Lenders from time to time party thereto and WE2014-1, LLC (&#8220;Waterfall&#8221; or &#8220;Lender&#8221;). The Borrower is permitted to borrow funds under the Credit Agreement based on the Borrower&#8217;s cash on hand and the Amortized Order Value of the Borrower&#8217;s Eligible Leases (as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement) less certain deductions described in the Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Borrower may borrow up to $25,000,000 from the Lender for a term of two years. The borrowing term may be extended for an additional twelve months in the sole discretion of the Lender. The Credit Agreement contemplates that the Lender may provide additional debt financing to the Borrower, up to $100 million in total, under two uncommitted accordions following satisfaction of certain covenants and other terms and conditions. The Lender will receive security interests in certain leases as collateral under the Credit Agreement. For the term of the Credit Agreement, FlexShopper and its subsidiaries may not incur additional indebtedness (other than certain indebtedness expressly permitted under the Credit Agreement) without the permission of the Lender. Waterfall and its affiliates will have a right of first refusal on certain subsequent FlexShopper transactions involving leases or other financial products during the term of the Credit Agreement and up to three months following the termination thereof. 

&#160;

Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, amounts borrowed by the Borrower will bear interest at the rate of LIBOR plus a mid-teen percent per annum, and a small non-usage fee will be assessed on any undrawn amount if the facility is less than 80% drawn on average in any given measurement period commencing three months after the closing of the facility. 

&#160;

The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including, among others, failures to make payment of principal and interest, breaches or defaults under the terms of the Credit Agreement and related agreements entered into with the Lender, breaches of representations, warranties or certifications made by or on behalf of the Borrower in the Credit Agreement and related documents (including certain financial and expense covenants), deficiencies in the borrowing base, certain judgments against the Borrower and bankruptcy events. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Lender may, among other things, terminate any remaining commitments available to the Borrower, declare all outstanding principal and interest immediately due and payable and enforce any and all liens created in connection with the Credit Agreement. In connection with the closing under the Credit Agreement, the Company paid placement agent fees totaling $850,000. 

&#160;

In connection with the issuance of the Shares to the Investors, on March 6, 2015, FlexShopper entered into Investor Rights Agreements with certain of the Investors. The Investor Rights Agreement entered into with affiliates of Waterfall provides that, so long as those Investors beneficially owning at least 10% of FlexShopper common stock then issued and outstanding, Waterfall will have the right to nominate one director to the FlexShopper Board of Directors. Upon the closing of the Equity Purchases, those Investors beneficially own more than 10% of FlexShopper common stock then issued and outstanding and thus are entitled to nominate one director to the Board. On March 26, 2015, the Board of Directors elected Philip Gitler to the board as a nominee of the Lender effective April 1, 2015. The Investor Rights Agreement with affiliates of Waterfall also entitles those Investors to certain demand registration rights and certain preemptive rights on future sales of equity securities of FlexShopper. The Waterfall Investor Rights Agreement and the Investor Rights Agreements entered into with other Investors entitle all Investors to certain piggyback registration rights.

Board Independence 

&#160;

The Board of Directors is currently comprised of Mr. Brad Bernstein, Mr. James Allen, Mr. Philip Gitler, Mr. T. Scott King and Mr. Carl Pradelli. Our common stock is traded on the OTCQB, which does not maintain any standards regarding the &#8220;independence&#8221; of the directors on the Board, and we are not subject to such requirements of any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system. In the absence of such requirements, we have elected to use the definition for &#8220;independent director&#8221; under NASDAQ&#8217;s rules. The Board of Directors has determined that each of James Allen, T. Scott King and Carl Pradelli is an independent director within the meaning of the director independence standards of NASDAQ. Furthermore, the Board has determined that all of the members of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee are independent within the meaning of the director independence standards of NASDAQ and the rules of the SEC applicable to each such committee.
