Description of Business 

Westlake Chemical Corporation (the "Company") operates as an integrated global manufacturer and marketer of basic chemicals, vinyls, polymers and building products. These products include some of the most widely used chemicals in the world, which are fundamental to many diverse consumer and industrial markets, including flexible and rigid packaging, automotive products, coatings, residential and commercial construction as well as other durable and non-durable goods. The Company's customers range from large chemical processors and plastics fabricators to small construction contractors, municipalities and supply warehouses primarily throughout North America and Europe. The petrochemical industry is subject to price fluctuations and volatile feedstock pricing typical of a commodity-based industry, the effects of which may not be immediately passed along to customers. 

Formation and Initial Public Offering of a Master Limited Partnership 

In 2014, the Company formed Westlake Chemical Partners LP ("Westlake Partners") to operate, acquire and develop facilities for the processing of natural gas liquids and related assets. Also in 2014, Westlake Partners completed an initial public offering of 12,937,500 &#32;common units (the "Westlake Partners IPO"). As of December 31, 2015 , Westlake Partners' assets consist of a 13.3% &#32;limited partner interest in Westlake Chemical OpCo LP ("OpCo"), as well as the general partner interest in OpCo. OpCo's assets include two &#32;natural gas liquids processing facilities at the Company's Lake Charles, Louisiana site, one &#32;natural gas liquids processing facility at the Company's Calvert City, Kentucky site and a 200 -mile common carrier ethylene pipeline that runs from Mont Belvieu, Texas to the Company's Longview, Texas site. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company held an 86.7% &#32;limited partner interest in OpCo and a significant interest in Westlake Partners. The operations of Westlake Partners are consolidated in the Company's financial statements. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and subsidiaries in which the Company directly or indirectly owns more than a 50% &#32;voting interest and exercises control and, when applicable, entities for which the Company has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. Investments in majority-owned companies where the Company does not exercise control and investments in nonconsolidated affiliates (20%-50% owned companies, joint ventures and partnerships) are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. There were no &#32;undistributed earnings from equity investments included in retained earnings as of December 31, 2015 . 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition. 

Investments 

Investments in debt and equity securities are classified as trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Investments classified as trading are carried at estimated fair value with changes in fair value currently recognized in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Investments classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost. The Company periodically reviews its available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities for other-than-temporary declines in fair value below the cost basis, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the investment is written down to fair value, establishing a new cost basis. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

The determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on estimation of the amount of accounts receivable that the Company believes are unlikely to be collected. Estimating this amount requires analysis of the financial strength of the Company's customers, the use of historical experience, the Company's accounts receivable aged trial balance, and specific collectibility analysis. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly. Past due balances over 90 days and high risk accounts as determined by the analysis of financial strength of customers are reviewed individually for collectibility.

Inventories 

Inventories primarily include product, material and supplies. Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") or average method. 

Property, Plant and Equipment 

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Cost includes expenditures for improvements and betterments that extend the useful lives of the assets and interest capitalized on significant capital projects. Capitalized interest was $10,449 , $7,059 &#32;and $25,932 &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred. Gains and losses on the disposition or retirement of fixed assets are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations when the assets are sold or retired. 

The accounting guidance for asset retirement obligations requires the recording of liabilities equal to the fair value of asset retirement obligations and corresponding additional asset costs, when there is a legal asset retirement obligation as a result of existing or enacted law, statute or contract. The Company has conditional asset retirement obligations for the removal and disposal of hazardous materials from certain of the Company's manufacturing facilities. However, no asset retirement obligations have been recognized because the fair value of the conditional legal obligation cannot be measured due to the indeterminate settlement date of the obligation. Settlement of these conditional asset retirement obligations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any individual reporting period. 

Depreciation is provided by utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Fair Value Estimates 

The Company develops estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire a business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, to assess impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and to record marketable securities, derivative instruments and pension plan assets. The Company uses all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the engagement of third-party consultants. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

The accounting guidance for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets requires that the Company review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets assessed for impairment are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Assets are considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. The impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell. 

Impairment of Intangible Assets 

The accounting guidance for goodwill and intangible assets requires that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually. Other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful life and reviewed for impairment in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company's recorded goodwill was $62,016 . See Note 6 for more information on the Company's annual goodwill impairment tests.

Turnaround Costs 

The Company accounts for turnaround costs under the deferral method. Turnarounds are the scheduled and required shutdowns of specific operating units in order to perform planned major maintenance activities. The costs related to the significant overhaul and refurbishment activities include maintenance materials, parts and direct labor costs. The costs of the turnaround are deferred when incurred at the time of the turnaround and amortized (within depreciation and amortization) on a straight-line basis until the next planned turnaround, which ranges from three &#32;to six &#32;years. Deferred turnaround costs are presented as a component of other assets, net. The cash outflows related to these costs are included in operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 

Exchanges 

The Company enters into inventory exchange transactions with third parties, which involve fungible commodities. These exchanges are settled in like-kind quantities and are valued at lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the FIFO method. 

Income Taxes 

The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded based upon temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period. Valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate as of the end of the year. Statement of operations items are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentration of risk consist principally of trade receivables from customers engaged in manufacturing polyethylene products, polyvinyl chloride ("PVC") products and PVC pipe products. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of the customers' financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains allowances for potential losses. 

Revenue Recognition 

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are delivered to the customer, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. For domestic contracts, title and risk of loss passes to the customer upon delivery under executed customer purchase orders or contracts. For export contracts, the title and risk of loss passes to customers at the time specified by each contract. Provisions for discounts, rebates and returns are provided for in the same period as the related sales are recorded. 

Earnings per Share 

The accounting guidance for earnings per share requires the Company to present basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock. 

Price Risk Management 

The accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires that the Company recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value, and changes in the derivative's fair value must be currently recognized in earnings or comprehensive income, depending on the designation of the derivative. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the 

WESTLAKE CHEMICAL CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) 

(in thousands of dollars, except share amounts and per share data) 

derivative is recorded in comprehensive income and is recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings currently. 

The Company utilizes commodity price swaps to reduce price risks by entering into price swaps with counterparties and by purchasing or selling futures on established exchanges. The Company takes both fixed and variable positions, depending upon anticipated future physical purchases and sales of these commodities. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is estimated using quoted market prices in active markets and observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data when active markets are not available. The Company assesses both counterparty as well as its own nonperformance risk when measuring the fair value of derivative liabilities. The Company does not consider its nonperformance risk to be significant. See Note 14 for a summary of the fair value of derivative instruments. 

Environmental Costs 

Environmental costs relating to current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate, depending on whether such costs provide future economic benefits. Remediation liabilities are recognized when the costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Measurement of liabilities is based on currently enacted laws and regulations, existing technology and undiscounted site-specific costs. Environmental liabilities in connection with properties that are sold or closed are realized upon such sale or closure, to the extent they are probable and estimable and not previously reserved. Recognition of any joint and several liabilities is based upon the Company's best estimate of its final pro rata share of the liability. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net and accounts payable approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. The fair value of the Company's debt at December 31, 2015 &#32;differs from the carrying value due to the Company's fixed rate senior notes. The fair value of financial instruments is estimated using quoted market prices in active markets and observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data when active markets are not available. See Note 14 for more information on the fair value of financial instruments. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Other 

Amortization of debt issuance costs is computed on a basis which approximates the interest method over the term of the related debt. Certain other assets (see Note 6) are amortized over periods ranging from one &#32;to 30 &#32;years using the straight-line method. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Revenue from Contracts with Customers 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an accounting standards update on a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede the existing revenue recognition guidance. The new accounting guidance creates a framework by which an entity will allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations and recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. Under the new standard, entities will be required to use judgment and make estimates, including identifying performance obligations in a contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation and determining when an entity satisfies its performance obligations. The standard allows for either "full retrospective" adoption, meaning that the standard is applied to all of the periods presented with a cumulative catch-up as of the earliest period presented, or "modified retrospective" adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements with a cumulative catch-up as of the current period. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for the revenue recognition standard. The accounting standard will now be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact that the new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

(in thousands of dollars, except share amounts and per share data) 

Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items 

In January 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to simplify income statement classification by removing the concept of extraordinary items from U.S. GAAP. Under the new standard, an unusual and infrequent event or transaction is no longer allowed to be separately disclosed as "extraordinary." The standard retains the existing requirement to separately present items that are of an unusual nature or occur infrequently on a pre-tax basis within income from continuing operations. The new guidance also requires similar separate presentation of items that are both unusual and infrequent on a pre-tax basis within income from continuing operations. The standard allows for either prospective or retrospective application. If adopted prospectively, both the nature and amount of any subsequent adjustments to previously reported extraordinary items must be disclosed. The accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is not expected to have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis 

In February 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update making certain changes to the current consolidation guidance. The amendments affect both the variable interest entity and voting interest entity consolidation models. The new standard changes the consideration of substantive rights, related party interests and fees paid to the decision maker when applying the variable interest entity consolidation model and eliminates certain guidance for limited partnerships and similar entities under the voting interest consolidation model. The accounting standard will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is not expected to have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs 

In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update on simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires all costs incurred to issue debt to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. The accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is not expected to have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory 

In July 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value rather than at the lower of cost or market. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Under the new standard, entities will no longer need to calculate other measures of "market." The new accounting guidance applies only to inventories for which cost is determined by methods other than last-in, first-out and the retail inventory method. The accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements 

In August 2015, the FASB issued final guidance incorporating into the Accounting Standards Codification a June 2015 SEC staff announcement that the SEC staff will not object to an entity presenting the cost of securing a revolving line of credit as an asset, regardless of whether a balance is outstanding. The announcement came in response to questions that arose after the FASB issued the Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs &#32;standard in April 2015, which standard requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability rather than as an asset. That standard, as issued, did not address revolving lines of credit, which may not have outstanding balances. An entity that repeatedly draws on a revolving credit facility and then repays the balance could also present the cost as an asset and reclassify all or a portion of it as a direct deduction from the liability whenever a balance is outstanding. Regardless of asset or contra-liability presentation, debt issuance costs should be amortized over the term of the arrangement. The accounting standard became effective upon announcement in June 2015 and did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments 

In September 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The guidance requires that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings 

WESTLAKE CHEMICAL CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) 

(in thousands of dollars, except share amounts and per share data) 

of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The new guidance further requires specific disclosure pertaining to the measurement period adjustments. The accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes 

In November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. As a result, each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. The new guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting within a jurisdiction. The accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and is not expected to have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. 

Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 

In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update making certain changes principally to the current guidance for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Among other things, the guidance (1) requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income; (2) provide entities with a policy election to record equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, and subsequent adjustments for observable price changes (changes in the basis of these equity investments to be reported in net income); (3) requires an entity that has elected the fair value option for financial liabilities to recognize changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk separately in other comprehensive income; (4) clarified current guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities; and (5) requires specific disclosure pertaining to financial assets and financial liabilities in the financial statements. The accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact that the new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Goodwill 

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below its carrying value. The Company performed its annual impairment tests for the Olefins and Vinyls segments' goodwill in October 2015 &#32;and April 2015 , respectively, and the impairment tests indicated that the recorded goodwill was not impaired. There has been no &#32;impairment of the Olefins or Vinyls segments' goodwill since the goodwill was initially recorded. The gross carrying amounts of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;are as follows:

Olefins Segment Goodwill 

The fair value of the Olefins segment, the reporting unit assessed, was calculated using both a discounted cash flow methodology and a market value methodology. The discounted cash flow projections were based on a nine -year forecast, from 2016 &#32;to 2024 , to reflect the cyclicality of the Company's olefins business. The forecast was based on (1) prices and spreads projected by IHS Chemical, a chemical industry organization offering market and business advisory services for the chemical market, for the same period, and (2) estimates by management, including its strategic and operational plans. Other significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow projection included sales volumes based on current capacities. The future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of 8.8% . 

WESTLAKE CHEMICAL CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) 

(in thousands of dollars, except share amounts and per share data) 

The significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit using the market value methodology include the determination of appropriate market comparables and the estimated multiples of EBITDA a willing buyer is likely to pay. 

Even if the fair value of the Olefins segment decreased by 10% , the carrying value of the Olefins segment would not exceed its fair value. 

Vinyls Segment Goodwill 

The fair value of the pipe and foundation building products business, the reporting unit assessed, was calculated using both a discounted cash flow methodology and a market value methodology. The discounted cash flow projections were based on a nine-year forecast, from 2015 &#32;to 2023, &#32;to reflect the cyclicality of the North American housing and construction markets as the Company's pipe and foundation building products business is significantly influenced by said markets. The forecast was based on historical results and estimates by management, including its strategic and operational plans, and assumed a gradual increase in financial performance based on a housing market recovery in the United States. The future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of 11.5% . 

The significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit using the market value methodology include the determination of appropriate market comparables and the estimated multiples of EBITDA a willing buyer is likely to pay. 

Even if the fair value of the reporting unit decreased by 10% , the carrying value of the reporting unit would not exceed its fair value.

Revolving Credit Facility 

The Company has a $400,000 &#32;senior secured revolving credit facility. The facility includes a provision permitting the Company to increase the size of the facility, up to four times, in increments of at least $25,000 &#32;each (up to a maximum of $200,000 ) under certain circumstances if the lenders agree to commit to such an increase. 

The facility allows the Company to borrow up to (1) 85% &#32;of the net amount of eligible accounts receivable, plus (2) the lesser of (a) 70% &#32;of the value of the lower of cost or market of eligible inventory, or (b) 85% &#32;of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of all eligible inventory, plus (3) 100% &#32;of cash held in an account with the agent under the credit facility and subject to a control agreement with the agent, minus (4) such reserves as the agent may establish. The facility includes a $400,000 &#32;sub-limit for letters of credit, and any outstanding letters of credit will be deducted from availability under the facility. 

WESTLAKE CHEMICAL CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) 

(in thousands of dollars, except share amounts and per share data) 

At December 31, 2015 , the Company had no &#32;borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Any borrowings under the facility will bear interest at either LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 1.25% &#32;to 1.75% , provided that so long as the Company is rated investment grade, the margin for LIBOR loans will not exceed 1.50% , or a base rate plus a spread ranging from 0.0% &#32;to 0.50% . The revolving credit facility also requires an unused commitment fee of 0.25% &#32;per annum. All interest rates under the facility are subject to monthly grid pricing adjustments based on prior month average daily loan availability. The revolving credit facility matures on July 17, 2019. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $30,098 &#32;and borrowing availability of $320,843 &#32;under the revolving credit facility. 

The Company's revolving credit facility generally restricts the Company's ability to make distributions unless, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the distribution, the borrowing availability under the facility equals or exceeds the greater of (1) 20% &#32;of the commitments under the facility and (2) $80,000 ; or the borrowing availability under the facility equals or exceeds the greater of (1) 15% &#32;of the commitments under the facility and (2) $60,000 , and the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio is at least 1.0 :1. However, the Company may make specified distributions up to an aggregate of $82,700 &#32;in 2016 , to be increased by 5% &#32;in each fiscal year thereafter, on an aggregate basis, for each fiscal year. 

In order to make acquisitions or investments, the Company's revolving credit facility provides that (1) the Company must maintain a minimum borrowing availability of at least the greater of $60,000 &#32;or 15% &#32;of the total bank commitments under its revolving credit facility or (2) the Company must maintain a minimum borrowing availability of at least the greater of $50,000 &#32;or 12.5% &#32;of the total bank commitments under the Company's revolving credit facility and meet a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 :1 under its revolving credit facility. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may make investments in the aggregate up to the greater of $50,000 &#32;and 1.25% &#32;of tangible assets and acquisitions in the aggregate up to the greater of $100,000 &#32;and 2.5% &#32;of tangible assets, if, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the acquisition or investment, either (X) the borrowing availability under the facility equals or exceeds the greater of (A) 12.5% &#32;of the total bank commitments under the facility and (B) $50,000 , but is less than the greater of (A) 15% &#32;of the total bank commitments and (B) $60,000 , or (Y) the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio is at least 1.0 :1. 

The revolving credit facility contains other customary covenants and events of default that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the Company. These restrictions, among other things, provide limitations on the occurrence of additional indebtedness and the Company's ability to create liens, to engage in certain affiliate transactions and to engage in sale-leaseback transactions. 

3.60% Senior Notes due 2022 

In July 2012, the Company issued $250,000 &#32;aggregate principal amount of its 3.60% &#32;senior notes due 2022 &#32;(the "3.60% Notes Due 2022"). The 3.60% Notes Due 2022 are unsecured and were issued with an original issue discount of $1,183 . There is no sinking fund and no scheduled amortization of the 3.60% Notes Due 2022 prior to maturity. The Company may optionally redeem the 3.60% Notes Due 2022 at any time and from time to time prior to April 15, 2022 (three months prior to the maturity date) for 100% &#32;of the principal plus accrued interest and a discounted "make whole" payment. On or after April 15, 2022, the Company may optionally redeem the 3.60% Notes Due 2022 for 100% &#32;of the principal plus accrued interest. The holders of the 3.60% Notes Due 2022 may require the Company to repurchase the 3.60% Notes Due 2022 at a price of 101% &#32;of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon the occurrence of both a "change of control" and, within 60 &#32;days of such change of control, a "below investment grade rating event" (as such terms are defined in the indenture governing the 3.60% Notes Due 2022). All domestic subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee other indebtedness of the Company or of another guarantor of the 3.60% Notes Due 2022 in excess of $5,000 &#32;are guarantors of the 3.60% Notes Due 2022. 

The indenture governing the 3.60% Notes Due 2022 contains customary events of default and covenants that will restrict the Company's and certain of its subsidiaries' ability to (1) incur certain secured indebtedness, (2) engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions and (3) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of the Company's assets. 

GO Zone Bonds 

In December 2010, the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facility and Development Authority (the "Authority"), a political subdivision of the State of Louisiana, completed the offering of $89,000 &#32;of 6 &#189;% tax-exempt revenue bonds due November 1, 2035 &#32;under the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 (the "GO Zone Act"). The bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company at any time prior to November 1, 2020 for 100% &#32;of the principal plus accrued interest and a discounted "make whole" payment. On or after November 1, 2020, the bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company for 100% &#32;of the principal plus accrued interest. 

WESTLAKE CHEMICAL CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) 

(in thousands of dollars, except share amounts and per share data) 

In July 2010, the Authority completed the reoffering of $100,000 &#32;of 6 &#189;% tax-exempt revenue bonds due August 1, 2029 &#32;under the GO Zone Act. The bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company at any time prior to August 1, 2020 for 100% &#32;of the principal plus accrued interest and a discounted "make whole" payment. On or after August 1, 2020, the bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company for 100% &#32;of the principal plus accrued interest. 

In December 2007, the Authority issued $250,000 &#32;of 6 &#190;% tax-exempt revenue bonds due November 1, 2032 &#32;under the GO Zone Act. The bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company at any time prior to November 1, 2017 for 100% &#32;of the principal plus accrued interest and a discounted "make whole" payment. On or after November 1, 2017, the bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company for 100% &#32;of the principal plus accrued interest. 

Each series of the bonds is subject to redemption and the holders may require the bonds to be repurchased upon a change of control or a change in or loss of the current tax status of the bonds. In addition, the bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company if certain events have occurred in connection with the operation of the projects for which the bond proceeds may be used, including if the Company has determined that the continued operation of any material portion of the projects would be impracticable, uneconomical or undesirable for any reason. 

In connection with each offering of the bonds, the Company entered into a loan agreement with the Authority pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay all of the principal, premium, if any, and interest on the bonds and certain other amounts to the Authority. The net proceeds from the offerings were loaned by the Authority to the Company. The Company used the proceeds to expand, refurbish and maintain certain of its facilities in the Louisiana Parishes of Calcasieu and Ascension. The bonds are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with other existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. All domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee other debt of the Company or of another guarantor of the 6 &#189;% senior notes due 2029, the 6 &#190;% senior notes due 2032 and the 6 &#189;% GO Zone Senior Notes Due 2035 (collectively, and including the 6 &#189;% IKE Zone Senior Notes Due 2035, the "Senior Notes") in excess of $5,000 &#32;are guarantors of the bonds. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had drawn all the proceeds from the 6 &#189;% bonds due 2029, 6 &#190;% bonds due 2032 and 6 &#189;% bonds due 2035. 

IKE Zone Bonds 

In December 2010, the Authority completed the offering of $65,000 &#32;of 6 &#189;% tax-exempt revenue bonds due November 1, 2035 &#32;under Section 704 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company at any time prior to November 1, 2020 for 100% &#32;of the principal plus accrued interest and a discounted "make whole" payment. On or after November 1, 2020, the bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company for 100% &#32;of the principal plus accrued interest. The bonds are subject to redemption, repurchase by the holders upon a change of control or a change in or loss of the current tax status of the bonds and optional redemption by the Authority under terms substantially similar to the terms for the GO Zone Bonds. 

In connection with the offering of the bonds, the Company entered into a loan agreement with the Authority pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay all of the principal, premium, if any, and interest on the bonds and certain other amounts to the Authority. The net proceeds from the offering were loaned by the Authority to the Company. The Company used the proceeds to expand, refurbish and maintain certain of its facilities in the Louisiana Parish of Calcasieu. The 6 &#189;% IKE Zone Senior Notes Due 2035 are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with other existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. All domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee other debt of the Company or of another guarantor of the Senior Notes in excess of $5,000 &#32;are guarantors of the 6 &#189;% IKE Zone Senior Notes Due 2035. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had drawn all the proceeds from the 6 &#189;% IKE Zone Senior Notes Due 2035. 

The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain customary covenants and events of default. Accordingly, these agreements generally impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the Company. These restrictions, among other things, provide limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness, the payment of dividends, certain investments and acquisitions and sales of assets. However, the effectiveness of certain of these restrictions is currently suspended because the Senior Notes are currently rated investment grade by at least two &#32;nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The most significant of these provisions, if it were currently effective, would restrict the Company from incurring additional debt, except specified permitted debt (including borrowings under its credit facility), when the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio is below 2.0 :1. These limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, including, without limitation, an exception for the payment of the Company's regular quarterly dividend of up to $0.10 &#32;per share. If the restrictions were currently effective, distributions in excess of $100,000 &#32;would not be allowed unless, after giving pro forma effect to the

(in thousands of dollars, except share amounts and per share data) 

distribution, the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio is at least 2.0:1 and such payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other distributions after January 13, 2006, is less than the sum of 50% &#32;of the Company's consolidated net income for the period from October 1, 2003 to the end of the most recent quarter for which financial statements have been filed, plus 100% &#32;of net cash proceeds received after October 1, 2003 as a contribution to the Company's common equity capital or from the issuance or sale of certain securities, plus several other adjustments. 

Revenue Bonds 

In December 1997, the Company entered into a loan agreement with a public trust established for public purposes for the benefit of the Parish of Calcasieu, Louisiana. The public trust issued $10,889 &#32;principal amount of tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds in order to finance the Company's construction of waste disposal facilities for an ethylene plant. The waste disposal revenue bonds expire in December 2027 &#32;and are subject to redemption and mandatory tender for purchase prior to maturity under certain conditions. Interest on the waste disposal revenue bonds accrues at a rate determined by a remarketing agent and is payable quarterly. The interest rate on the waste disposal revenue bonds at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;was 0.07% &#32;and 0.05% , respectively.

9. Stockholders' Equity 

The Company's Board of Directors has declared regular quarterly dividends to holders of its common stock aggregating $91,551 , $77,656 &#32;and $55,236 &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Common Stock 

Each share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters on which holders are permitted to vote, including the election of directors. There are no cumulative voting rights. &#32;Accordingly, holders of a majority of the total votes entitled to vote in an election of directors will be able to elect all of the directors standing for election. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding preferred stock, the holders of the common stock will share equally on a per share basis any dividends when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. If the Company is liquidated, dissolved or wound up, the holders of the Company's common stock will be entitled to a ratable share of any distribution to stockholders, after satisfaction of all the Company's liabilities and of the prior rights of any outstanding class of the Company's preferred stock. The Company's common stock has no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights. &#32;There are no &#32;redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Company's common stock. 

On February 14, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a two -for-one split of the Company's common stock. Stockholders of record as of February 28, 2014 were entitled to one additional share for every share outstanding, which was distributed on March 18, 2014. The total number of authorized common stock shares and associated par value were unchanged by this stock split. All share amounts and per share data included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, &#32; 2013 &#32;has been restated to reflect the effect of the stock split. 

In 2014, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the Company's authorized shares of common stock from 150,000,000 &#32;shares to 300,000,000 &#32;shares, par value $0.01 &#32;per share. The Company issued 134,663,244 &#32;and 134,679,064 &#32;shares of common stock as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

Preferred Stock 

The Company's charter authorizes the issuance of shares of preferred stock. The Company's Board of Directors has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred shares from time to time in one or more series, and to fix the number of shares and terms of each such series. The Board may determine the designations and other terms of each series including dividend rates, whether dividends will be cumulative or non-cumulative, redemption rights, liquidation rights, sinking fund provisions, conversion or exchange rights and voting rights.

Stock Repurchase Program 

In August 2011, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of the Company's common stock totaling $100,000 &#32;(the "2011 Program"). As of March 31, 2015, the Company had repurchased 1,944,161 &#32;shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $100,000 &#32;under the 2011 Program, the full amount of the 2011 Program. In November 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new $250,000 &#32;share repurchase program (the "2014 Program"). On November 20, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved the expansion of the 2014 Program by an additional $150,000 . The total number of shares repurchased by the Company under the 2014 Program was 2,682,489 &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Any shares repurchased under the 2011 and 2014 Programs are held by the Company as treasury stock and may be used for general corporate purposes, including for the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Beginning in 2014, the Company began delivering treasury shares to employees and nonemployee directors for options exercised and for the settlement of restricted stock units. The cost of treasury shares delivered was determined using the specific identification method.

11. Employee Benefits 

Defined Contribution Plans 

U.S. Plans 

The Company has a defined contribution savings plan covering all U.S. regular full-time and part-time employees whereby eligible employees may elect to contribute up to 100% &#32;of their annual compensation, subject to an annual plan limit in line with the annual elective contribution limit as determined by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches 100% &#32;of an employee's contribution up to the first 4% &#32;of such employee's compensation. The Company may, at its discretion, make an additional non-matching contribution in an amount as the Board of Directors may determine. For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the Company charged approximately $7,594 , $6,856 &#32;and $6,022 , respectively, to expense for these contributions. 

Further, within the defined contribution savings plan, the Company also makes an annual retirement contribution to substantially all employees of one subsidiary who have completed one &#32;year of service. The Company's contributions to the plan are determined as a percentage of employees' base and overtime pay. For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the Company charged approximately $11,715 , $8,309 &#32;and $6,227 , respectively, to expense for these contributions. 

Non-U.S. Plans 

The Company has various defined contribution plans in Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and Belgium covering eligible employees of our European operations. The Company's contributions to the plans are based on applicable laws in each country. Contributions to the Company's non-U.S. defined contribution plans are made by both the employee and the Company. For the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the Company charged approximately $1,912 &#32;and $416 , respectively, to expense for its contributions to these plans.

(in thousands of dollars, except share amounts and per share data) 

Defined Benefit Plans 

U.S. Plans 

The Company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover certain eligible salaried and wage employees of one subsidiary. However, eligibility for both plans has been frozen. Benefits for salaried employees under these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. Benefits for wage employees are based upon years of service and a fixed amount as periodically adjusted. The Company recognizes the years of service prior to the Company's acquisition of the subsidiary's facilities for purposes of determining vesting, eligibility and benefit levels for certain employees of the subsidiary and for determining vesting and eligibility for certain other employees of the subsidiary. The measurement date for these plans is December 31. 

In December 2014, the Company announced a plan amendment to one of the Company's defined benefit pension plans. Under the plan amendment, no additional benefits may be earned by participants after January 31, 2015 and participants' accrued benefit will freeze at the level earned as of January 31, 2015. In addition, the amendment added a lump sum payment option effective February 1, 2015. The Company made a similar plan amendment to its other defined benefit pension plan in 2012. In conjunction with both of the defined benefit pension plans' amendments, the Company amended, in 2014 and 2012, its defined contribution savings plan to allow participants impacted by the amendments to participate in the Company's annual retirement contribution program. 

Non-U.S. Plans 

The Company has defined benefit pension plans covering current and former employees associated with our European operations. These pension plans are closed to new participants and are for employees in Germany who commenced employment before July 1, 2007. Benefits for employees for these plans are based primarily on employees' pay near retirement. The non-U.S. plans are unfunded as no contributions have been made to the plans and therefore, have no plan assets. The measurement date for these plans is December 31. 

Details of the changes in benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of the Company's pension plans are as follows:

After-tax totals for pension benefits were $6,812 &#32;and $20,315 &#32;for 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, and are reflected in stockholders' equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss. 

In the United States, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the "Pension Protection Act") established a relationship between a qualified pension plan's funded status and the actual benefits that can be provided. Restrictions on plan benefits and additional funding and notice requirements are imposed when a plan's funded status is less than certain threshold levels. For the 2015 &#32;plan year, the funded status for the Company's U.S. pension plans are above 80% , with both plans' funded status above 100% . Accordingly, the Company's U.S. pension plans are exempt from the Pension Protection Act's benefit restrictions. 

Pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets at December 31 are as follows:

The Company's return on asset assumption of 7.0% &#32;for its U.S. plans is based on historical asset returns, anticipated future performance of the investments and financial markets and input from the Company's third-party independent actuary and the pension fund trustee. There are no plan assets for the Company's non-U.S. plans. The discount rates for the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. plans are determined using a benchmark pension discount curve and applying spot rates from the curve to each year of expected benefit payments to determine the appropriate discount rate for the Company. 

The Company's overall investment strategy for its U.S. plan assets is to achieve a balance between moderate income generation and capital appreciation. The investment strategy includes a mix of approximately 55% &#32;of investments for long-term growth and 45% &#32;for near-term benefit payments with a diversification of asset types. The Company does not believe that there 

WESTLAKE CHEMICAL CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) 

(in thousands of dollars, except share amounts and per share data) 

are significant concentrations of risk in the pension plan assets due to its strategy of asset diversification. The pension fund investment policy allows the pension fund trustee a 10% &#32;discretionary range in the asset allocation model, with a target of approximately 55% &#32;equity securities and 45% &#32;fixed income. The Company expects to maintain the 55 / 45 &#32;investment policy for the near future. Equity securities primarily include investments in large-cap and small-cap companies located in the United States and international developed market stocks. Fixed income securities are comprised of investment grade bonds, including U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries. At December 31, 2015 , plan assets did not include direct ownership of the Company's common stock. 

Under the accounting guidance for fair value measurements, inputs used to measure fair value are classified in one of three levels: 

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. 

The investments in the bank collective trust funds are valued using a market approach based on the net asset value of units held. The fair values of the Company's U.S. plan assets at December 31, by asset category, are as follows:

Multi-employer Plans 

Non-U.S. Plans 

The Company participates in two &#32;multi-employer plans, Pensionskasse der Mitarbeiter der Hoechst-Gruppe VVaG and Pensionskasse der Wacker-Chemie GmbH VVaG, which provide benefits to certain of the Company's employees in Germany. These multi-employer plans are closed to new participants. The benefit obligations are covered up to a certain salary threshold by contributions made by the Company and employees to the plans.

The plan information for both the Pensionskasse der Mitarbeiter der Hoechst-Gruppe VVaG and Pensionskasse der Wacker-Chemie GmbH VVaG plans is publicly available. The plans provide fixed, monthly retirement payments on the basis of the credits earned by the participating employees. To the extent that the plans are underfunded, future contributions to the plans may increase and may be used to fund retirement benefits for employees related to other employers. The Company does not consider either of its multi-employer plans individually significant. 

Other Post-retirement Benefits 

U.S. Plans 

The Company provides post-retirement healthcare benefits to the employees of two &#32;subsidiaries who meet certain minimum age and service requirements. The Company has the right to modify or terminate some of these benefits.

12. Stock-Based Compensation 

Under the Westlake Chemical Corporation 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the "2013 Plan"), all employees and non-employee directors of the Company, as well as certain individuals who have agreed to become the Company's employees, are eligible for awards. Shares of common stock may be issued as authorized in the 2013 Plan. At the discretion of the administrator of the 2013 Plan, employees and non-employee directors may be granted awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, restricted stock units or cash awards (any of which may be a performance award). Outstanding stock option awards have a 10 -year term and vest either (1) ratably on an annual basis over a one &#32;to four -year period or (2) at the end of a five &#32;to 9.5 -year period. Current outstanding restricted stock awards vest on the 9.5 -year anniversary of the award date. Outstanding restricted stock units vest either (1) ratably on an annual basis over a three -year period or (2) at the end of a one &#32;to six -year period. In accordance with accounting guidance related to share-based payments, stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards is based on estimated grant-date fair value. The Company recognizes these stock-based compensation costs net of a forfeiture rate and on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award for only those shares expected to vest. For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the total recognized stock-based compensation expense related to the 2013 Plan was $10,196 , $9,261 &#32;and $6,966 , respectively.

(in thousands of dollars, except share amounts and per share data) 

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company's closing stock price on the last trading day of the year and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2015 . This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company's common stock. For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the total intrinsic value of options exercised was $1,145 , $14,534 &#32;and $7,656 , respectively. 

As of December 31, 2015 , $3,755 &#32;of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.3 &#32;years. Income tax benefits of $78 , $4,512 &#32;and $2,224 &#32;were realized from the exercise of stock options during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

The Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value its options. The table below presents the weighted average value and assumptions used in determining each option's fair value. Volatility was calculated using historical trends of the Company's common stock price.

Westlake Chemical Partners LP Awards 

Our wholly-owned subsidiary and the general partner of Westlake Partners, Westlake Chemical Partners GP LLC ("WLKPGP"), maintains a unit-based compensation plan for directors and employees of WLKPGP and Westlake Partners. 

The Westlake Partners 2014 Long-term Incentive Plan ("Westlake Partners 2014 Plan") permits various types of equity awards including but not limited to grants of phantom units and restricted units. Awards granted under the Westlake Partners 2014 Plan may be settled with Westlake Partners units or in cash or a combination thereof. Compensation expense for these awards was not material to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

13. Derivative Commodity Instruments 

Commodity Risk Management 

The Company uses derivative instruments to reduce price volatility risk on commodities, primarily natural gas and ethane, from time to time. The Company does not use derivative instruments to engage in speculative activities. 

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gains or losses on the derivative instruments, as well as the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, were included in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 . The Company had no &#32;derivative instruments that were designated as fair value hedges during the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments were included in gross profit in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

The exposure on commodity derivatives used for price risk management includes the risk that the counterparty will not pay if the market declines below the established fixed price. In such case, the Company would lose the benefit of the derivative differential on the volume of the commodities covered. In any event, the Company would continue to receive the market price on the actual volume hedged. The Company also bears the risk that it could lose the benefit of market improvements over the fixed derivative price for the term and volume of the derivative instruments (as such improvements would accrue to the benefit of the counterparty). 

The fair values of derivative instruments in the Company's consolidated balance sheets were as follows:

Disclosure about Offsetting Asset and Liability Derivatives 

Certain of the Company's derivative instruments are executed under an International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("ISDA") Master Agreement, which permits the Company and a counterparty to aggregate the amounts owed by each party under multiple transactions and replace them with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. The following tables present the Company's derivative assets and derivative liabilities reported on the consolidated balance sheets and derivative assets and derivative liabilities subject to enforceable master netting arrangements.

14. Fair Value Measurements 

The Company reports certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The following tables summarize, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Company's assets and liabilities at December 31 that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis:

WESTLAKE CHEMICAL CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) 

(in thousands of dollars, except share amounts and per share data) 

There were no transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy in 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

In addition to the assets and liabilities above, the Company has other financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measures. These financial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net, accounts payable and long-term debt, all of which are recorded at carrying value. The amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net and accounts payable approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. The carrying and fair values of the Company's long-term debt at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;are summarized in the table below. The Company's long-term debt instruments are publicly-traded. A market approach, based upon quotes from financial reporting services, is used to measure the fair value of the Company's long-term debt. Because the Company's long-term debt instruments may not be actively traded, the inputs used to measure the fair value of the Company's long-term debt are classified as Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.

At December 31, 2015 , the Company had foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $267,192 , which will expire in varying amounts between 2016 and 2035 and are subject to certain limitations on an annual basis. Management believes the Company will realize the benefit of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards before they expire, but to the extent that the full benefit may not be realized, a net operating loss valuation allowance has been recorded. The valuation allowance increased by $5,334 &#32;in 2015 &#32;due to the creation of additional state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards. 

We do not consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;to be permanently reinvested and, accordingly, all required income tax consequences have been considered on such income in accordance with current applicable rules.

16. Earnings per Share 

The Company has unvested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units outstanding that are considered participating securities and, therefore, computes basic and diluted earnings per share under the two-class method. Basic earnings per share for the periods are based upon the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the periods. Diluted earnings per share include the effect of certain stock options.

Huasu is a polyvinyl chloride ("PVC") joint venture based near Shanghai, in the People's Republic of China and has a combined annual capacity of 300 million &#32;pounds of PVC resin and 145 million &#32;pounds of PVC film and sheet. 

Prior to the acquisition of this 35.7% &#32;interest, the Company owned a 59.3% &#32;interest in Huasu. The Company accounted for the investment using the equity method of accounting because Huasu did not meet the definition of a variable interest entity and because contractual arrangements giving certain substantive participatory rights to minority shareholders prevented the Company from exercising a controlling financial interest over Huasu. As a result of the Company obtaining control over Huasu, the Company's 59.3% &#32;interest was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a loss of $1,505 , which is included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. 

The closing date purchase price of $5,518 &#32;was paid with available cash on hand. The acquisition is being accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The transaction resulted in a bargain purchase acquisition-date gain of $22,550 &#32;and is recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company believes there are several factors that contributed to this transaction resulting in a bargain purchase acquisition-date gain, including the slowdown in the growth of, and current weakness in, the Chinese economy. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of operations of this acquired business are included in the Vinyls segment. Huasu's net sales and earnings included in the consolidated statement of operations since the acquisition date have not been presented separately as they are not material to the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. The acquisition-related costs recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 are not material. The pro forma impact of this business combination has not been presented as it is not material to the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. 

The following table summarizes the consideration transferred and the estimated fair value of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. The final determination of fair value for certain assets and liabilities will be completed as soon as the information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained. These amounts will be finalized as soon as possible, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.

Vinnolit Holdings GmbH and Subsidiary Companies 

On July 31, 2014, the Company acquired all the equity interests in German-based Vinnolit Holdings GmbH and its subsidiary companies ("Vinnolit") from several entities associated with Advent International Corporation (the "Sellers"). Vinnolit is headquartered in Ismaning, Germany and is an integrated global leader in specialty PVC resins, with a combined annual capacity of 1.7 billion &#32;pounds of PVC, including specialty paste and suspension grades, 1.5 billion &#32;pounds of vinyl chloride monomer ("VCM") and 1.0 billion &#32;pounds of caustic soda. The Vinnolit acquisition included six production facilities located in Burghausen, Gendorf, Cologne, Knapsack and Schkopau in Germany and Hillhouse in the United Kingdom. The Company also acquired Vinnolit's technical centers, including a research and development facility in Gendorf and an applications laboratory in Burghausen. The Company's management believes that this strategic acquisition will enhance its strategy of integration and expansion into new markets and specialty products, in addition to growing the Company's global presence with a footprint in Europe and surrounding markets. 

The purchase price of $736,224 &#32;was paid with available cash on hand. The acquisition is being accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of operations of this acquired business are included in the Vinyls segment.

The pro forma amounts above have been calculated after applying the Company's accounting policies and adjusting the Vinnolit results to reflect (1) the additional depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets had been applied from January 1, 2013; (2) the elimination of interest expense assuming the long-term debt paid off on behalf of the Sellers as of the acquisition date had been retired as of January 1, 2013; (3) the elimination of transaction-related costs; and (4) an adjustment to tax-effect the aforementioned pro forma adjustments using an estimated aggregate statutory income tax rate of the jurisdictions to which the above adjustments relate. The pro forma amounts do not include any potential synergies, cost savings or other expected benefits of the Vinnolit acquisition, are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of results that would have been achieved if the acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2013 or of future operating performance. 

For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recognized $13,427 &#32;of transaction-related costs. These costs are included in general and administrative expenses and other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. The transaction-related costs included in other income (expense), net pertained to losses incurred on forward foreign exchange contracts for the purchase consideration of Vinnolit. 

The following table summarizes the purchase consideration transferred and the fair value of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. As the fair value of the net assets acquired equals consideration paid, no goodwill was recorded.

______________________________ 

(1) 

None of the cash held in escrow is considered contingent consideration as it is expected to be released to the Sellers pending the Sellers' satisfaction of general representations and warranties made in connection with the execution of the purchase agreement. 

(2) 

Vinnolit's long-term debt paid on behalf of the Sellers was not legally assumed by Westlake in the acquisition and the retirement was a condition of the consummation of the purchase agreement. Therefore, the retirement has been included in the total purchase consideration. 

(3) 

The fair value of accounts receivable acquired is $181,890 , with the gross contractual amount being $183,833 . The Company expects $1,943 &#32;to be uncollectable. 

(4) 

An adjustment of approximately $16,900 &#32;was recorded to reflect Vinnolit's inventories at fair value and increased cost of sales by the same amount for the year ended December 31, 2014. 

(5) 

Included in other assets was a loan acquired that was repaid prior to December 31, 2014. 

(6) 

A liability arising from the unfavorable forward purchase contracts for the purchase of power was recognized at fair value. This liability will be amortized over a period of approximately three &#32;years, being the weighted-average life of the forward purchase contracts. 

(7) 

As the fair value of the net assets acquired equals consideration paid, no goodwill was recorded.

22. Commitments and Contingencies 

The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that can impose civil and criminal sanctions and that may require it to mitigate the effects of contamination caused by the release or disposal of hazardous substances into the environment. Under one law, the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), an owner or operator of property may be held strictly liable for remediating contamination without regard to whether that person caused the contamination, and without regard to whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time they occurred. Because several of the Company's production sites have a history of industrial use, it is impossible to predict precisely what effect these legal requirements will have on the Company. 

European Regulations. Under the Industrial Emission Directive ("IED"), European Union member state governments are expected to adopt rules and implement environmental permitting programs relating to air, water and waste for industrial facilities. In this context, concepts such as BAT ("best available technique") are being explored. Future implementation of these concepts may result in technical modifications in the Company's European facilities. In addition, under the Environmental Liability Directive, European Union member states can require the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination in certain circumstances, under the "polluter pays principle." The Company is unable to predict the impact these requirements and concepts may have on its future costs of compliance. 

Contract Disputes with Goodrich and PolyOne. &#32;In connection with the 1990 and 1997 acquisitions of the Goodrich Corporation ("Goodrich") chemical manufacturing facility in Calvert City, Goodrich agreed to indemnify the Company for any liabilities related to preexisting contamination at the site. For its part, the Company agreed to indemnify Goodrich for post-closing contamination caused by the Company's operations. The soil and groundwater at the site, which does not include the Company's nearby PVC facility, had been extensively contaminated under Goodrich's operations. In 1993, Goodrich spun off the predecessor of PolyOne Corporation ("PolyOne"), and that predecessor assumed Goodrich's indemnification obligations relating to preexisting contamination. 

In 2003, litigation arose among the Company, Goodrich and PolyOne with respect to the allocation of the cost of remediating contamination at the site. The parties settled this litigation in December 2007 and the case was dismissed. In the settlement the parties agreed that, among other things: (1) PolyOne would pay 100% &#32;of the costs (with specified exceptions), net of recoveries or credits from third parties, incurred with respect to environmental issues at the Calvert City site from August 1, 2007 forward; (2) either the Company or PolyOne might, from time to time in the future (but not more than once every five years ), institute an arbitration proceeding to adjust that percentage; and (3) the Company and PolyOne would negotiate a new environmental remediation utilities and services agreement to cover the Company's provision to, or on behalf of, PolyOne of certain environmental remediation services at the site. The current environmental remediation activities at the Calvert City site do not have a specified termination date but are expected to last for the foreseeable future. The costs incurred by the Company that have been invoiced to PolyOne to provide the environmental remediation services were $2,210 , $2,805 &#32;and $3,284 &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. By letter dated March 16, 2010, PolyOne notified the Company that it was initiating an arbitration proceeding under the settlement agreement. In this proceeding, PolyOne sought to readjust the percentage allocation of costs and to recover approximately $1,400 &#32;from the Company in reimbursement of previously paid remediation costs. In December 2015, the arbitration panel dismissed the proceeding with prejudice. In a separate proceeding in Ohio state court, the Company is seeking certain insurance documents from PolyOne. 

State Administrative Proceedings. &#32;There are several administrative proceedings in Kentucky involving the Company, Goodrich and PolyOne related to the same manufacturing site in Calvert City. In 2003, the Kentucky Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet (the "Cabinet") re-issued Goodrich's Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") permit which requires Goodrich to remediate contamination at the Calvert City manufacturing site. Both Goodrich and PolyOne challenged various terms of the permit in an attempt to shift Goodrich's clean-up obligations under the permit to the Company. The Company intervened in the proceedings. The Cabinet has suspended all corrective action under the RCRA permit in deference to a remedial investigation and feasibility study ("RIFS") being conducted, under the auspices of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), pursuant to an Administrative Settlement Agreement ("AOC"), which became effective on December 9, 2009. See "Federal Administrative Proceedings" below. The proceedings have been postponed. Periodic status conferences will be held to evaluate whether additional proceedings will be required. 

Federal Administrative Proceedings. &#32;In May 2009, the Cabinet sent a letter to the EPA requesting the EPA's assistance in addressing contamination at the Calvert City site under CERCLA. In its response to the Cabinet also in May 2009, the EPA stated that it concurred with the Cabinet's request and would incorporate work previously conducted under the Cabinet's RCRA authority into the EPA's cleanup efforts under CERCLA. Since 1983, the EPA has been addressing contamination at an abandoned landfill adjacent to the Company's plant which had been operated by Goodrich and which was being remediated 

WESTLAKE CHEMICAL CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) 

(in thousands of dollars, except share amounts and per share data) 

pursuant to CERCLA. The EPA has directed Goodrich and PolyOne to conduct additional investigation activities at the landfill and at the Company's plant. In June 2009, the EPA notified the Company that the Company may have potential liability under section 107(a) of CERCLA at its plant site. Liability under section 107(a) of CERCLA is strict and joint and several. The EPA also identified Goodrich and PolyOne, among others, as potentially responsible parties at the plant site. The Company negotiated, in conjunction with the other potentially responsible parties, an AOC and an order to conduct a RIFS. On July 12, 2013, the parties submitted separate draft RIFS reports to the EPA. The EPA has hired a contractor to complete the remedial investigation report. 

Monetary Relief . Except as noted above with respect to the settlement of the contract litigation among the Company, Goodrich and PolyOne, none of the court, the Cabinet nor the EPA has established any allocation of the costs of remediation among the various parties that are involved in the judicial and administrative proceedings discussed above. At this time, the Company is not able to estimate the loss or reasonable possible loss, if any, on the Company's financial statements that could result from the resolution of these proceedings. Any cash expenditures that the Company might incur in the future with respect to the remediation of contamination at the site would likely be spread out over an extended period. As a result, the Company believes it is unlikely that any remediation costs allocable to it will be material in terms of expenditures made in any individual reporting period. 

Potential Flare Modifications . For several years, the EPA has been conducting an enforcement initiative against petroleum refineries and petrochemical plants with respect to emissions from flares. A number of companies have entered into consent agreements with the EPA requiring both modifications to reduce flare emissions and the installation of additional equipment to better track flare operations and emissions. On April 21, 2014, the Company received a Clean Air Act Section 114 Information Request from the EPA which sought information regarding flares at the Calvert City and Lake Charles facilities. The EPA has informed the Company that the information provided leads the EPA to believe that some of the flares are out of compliance with applicable standards. The EPA has demanded that the Company conduct additional flare sampling and provide supplemental information. The Company is currently in negotiations with the EPA regarding these demands. The EPA has indicated that it is seeking a consent decree that would obligate the Company to take corrective actions relating to the alleged noncompliance. The Company has not agreed that any flares are out of compliance or that any corrective actions are warranted. Depending on the outcome of the Company's negotiations with the EPA, additional controls on emissions from its flares may be required and these could result in increased capital and operating costs. 

Louisiana Notice of Violations. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality ("LDEQ") has issued notices of violations ("NOVs") regarding the Company's assets for various air compliance issues. The Company is working with LDEQ to settle these claims, and a global settlement of all claims is being discussed. The Company has reached a verbal agreement with the LDEQ to settle certain of the NOVs in two &#32;separate settlements for a combined $192 &#32;in civil penalties. The Company does not believe that any settlements for the remaining NOVs will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

In addition to the matters described above, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of its business. The Company does not believe that any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company has various unconditional purchase obligations, primarily to purchase goods and services, including commitments to purchase various utilities, feedstock, nitrogen, oxygen, product storage and pipeline usage. Unrecorded unconditional purchase obligations for the next five years are as follows: $184,581 , $194,434 , $176,230 , $149,194 &#32;and $141,352 &#32;in 2016 , 2017 , 2018 , 2019 &#32;and 2020 , respectively. 

23. Segment and Geographic Information 

Segment Information 

The Company operates in two &#32;principal operating segments: Olefins and Vinyls. These segments are strategic business units that offer a variety of different products. The Company manages each segment separately as each business requires different technology and marketing strategies. 

The Company's Olefins segment manufactures and markets polyethylene, styrene monomer and various ethylene co-products. The Company's ethylene production is used in the Company's polyethylene, styrene and vinyl chloride monomer ("VCM") operations. In addition, the Company sells ethylene and ethylene co-products, primarily propylene, crude butadiene, pyrolysis gasoline and hydrogen, to external customers. 

The majority of sales in the Company's Olefins business are made under long-term agreements where contract volumes are established within a range (typically, more than one year). Earlier terminations may occur if the parties fail to agree on price and deliveries are suspended for a period of several months. In most cases, these contracts also contemplate extension of the term unless specifically terminated by one of the parties. No &#32;single customer accounted for more than 10% of sales in the Olefins segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;or 2013 . 

The Company's Vinyls segment manufactures and markets PVC, VCM, EDC, chlorine, caustic soda and ethylene. The Company also manufactures and sells products fabricated from PVC that the Company produces, including pipe, fittings, profiles, foundation building products, fence and deck components, window and door components and film and sheet products. The Company's main North American chemical manufacturing facilities are located in Calvert City and Geismar, Louisiana. The Company also has five manufacturing sites in Germany, one manufacturing site in the United Kingdom and one manufacturing site in the People's Republic of China. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company owned 11 &#32;building products plants. The Company uses its chlorine, VCM and PVC production to manufacture its building products. No &#32;single customer accounted for more than 10% of sales in the Vinyls segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;or 2013 . 

The accounting policies of the individual segments are the same as those described in Note 1.

(in thousands of dollars, except share amounts and per share data) 

25. Guarantor Disclosures 

The Company's payment obligations under the 3.60% &#32;senior notes due 2022 &#32;are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of its current and future domestic subsidiaries that guarantee other debt of the Company or of another guarantor of the 3.60% &#32;senior notes due 2022 &#32;in excess of $5,000 &#32;(the "Guarantor Subsidiaries"). Except for OpCo, which is less than 100% &#32;owned, each Guarantor Subsidiary is 100% &#32;owned by Westlake Chemical Corporation (the " 100% &#32;Owned Guarantor Subsidiaries"). See Note 20 regarding Westlake Partners' 10.6% &#32;limited partnership interest in OpCo. The initial public offering of Westlake Partners resulted in OpCo ceasing to be a 100% &#32;owned subsidiary of the Company. OpCo has been presented as a less than 100% &#32;owned guarantor subsidiary in each of the tables below, including for periods prior to the initial public offering of Westlake Partners. These guarantees are the joint and several obligations of the Guarantor Subsidiaries. The following unaudited condensed consolidating financial information presents the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Westlake Chemical Corporation, the 100% &#32;owned Guarantor Subsidiaries, OpCo and the remaining subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 3.60% &#32;senior notes due 2022 &#32;(the "Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries"), together with consolidating eliminations necessary to present the Company's results on a consolidated basis.

(1) 

Basic and diluted earnings per common share ("EPS") for each quarter is computed using the weighted average shares outstanding during that quarter, while EPS for the year is computed using the weighted average shares outstanding for the year. As a result, the sum of the EPS for each of the four quarters may not equal the EPS for the year.
