 ITEM 1 . BUSINESS 

General 

Franklin Covey Co. (we, us, our, the Company, or FranklinCovey) is a global company specializing in performance improvement. We help organizations achieve results that require a change in human behavior, and our mission is to &#8220;enable greatness in people and organizations everywhere.&#8221; We believe that our results-driven principle-centered content is a competitive advantage in the marketplace. From the foundational work of Dr. Stephen R. Covey in leadership and Hyrum W. Smith in productivity, we have developed deep expertise that extends to helping organizations and individuals achieve lasting behavioral change in seven crucial areas: Leadership, Execution, Productivity, Trust, Sales Performance, Customer Loyalty, and Educational improvement. We have over 870 employees worldwide delivering these principle-based offerings and effectiveness tools to our customers. Our consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 totaled $200.1 million and our shares of common stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol &#8220;FC.&#8221; 

We operate globally with one common brand and business model designed to enable us to provide clients around the world with the same high level of service. To achieve this level of service we operate three regional sales offices in the United States; an office that specializes in sales to governmental entities; wholly owned subsidiaries in Australia, Japan, and the United Kingdom; and we contract with licensee partners who deliver our content and provide services in over 150 other countries and territories around the world. On September 1, 2016, we opened three new sales offices in China. Our offerings and products were previously sold in China by an independent licensee. 

Our business-to-business service utilizes our expertise in training, consulting, and technology that is designed to help our clients define great performance and execute at the highest levels. We also provide clients with training in management skills, relationship skills, and individual effectiveness, and we can provide personal-effectiveness literature and electronic educational solutions to our clients as needed. 

During fiscal 2016 we introduced a new way to deliver our content and offerings to our clients. Through the All Access Pass, our clients have access to our world-class offerings and training materials. Clients may utilize complete offerings such as The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and The 5 Choices to Extraordinary Productivity , or use individual concepts from any of our well-known offerings to create a custom solution to fit their organizational or individual training needs. We believe the flexibility of the All Access Pass will provide significant benefits to our clients and their organizations. 

Our fiscal year ends on August 31 of each year. Unless otherwise noted, references to fiscal years apply to the 12 months ended August 31 of the specified year. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Services Overview 

Our mission is to &#8220;enable greatness in people and organizations everywhere,&#8221; and we believe that we are experts at solving certain pervasive, intractable problems, each of which requires a change in human behavior. As we deliver our solutions to these problems, we believe there are four important characteristics that distinguish us from our competitors. 

1. 

World Class Content &#8211; Rather than rely on &#8220;flavor of the month&#8221; training fads, our content is principle-centered and based on natural laws of human behavior and effectiveness. Our content is designed to build new skillsets, establish new mindsets, and provide enabling toolsets. When our content is applied consistently in an organization, we believe the culture of that organization will change to enable the organization to achieve their own great purposes. Our content is well researched, subjected to numerous field beta tests, and improved through a proven development process. 

&#160;

2. 

Breadth and Scalability of Delivery Options &#8211; We have a wide range of content delivery options, including: the All Access Pass and other intellectual property licensing arrangements, on-site training, training led through certified facilitators, on-line learning, blended learning, and organization-wide transformational processes, including consulting and coaching. 

&#160;

3. 

Global Capability &#8211; We operate three regional sales offices in the United States; wholly owned subsidiaries in Australia, Japan, and the United Kingdom; and contract with licensee partners who deliver our content in over 150 other countries and territories around the world. This capability allows us to deliver content to a wide range of customers, from large, multinational corporations to smaller, local entities. On September 1, 2016 we opened three new sales offices in China. Our offerings and products were previously sold in China by an independent licensee. 

&#160;

4. 

Transformational Impact and Reach &#8211; We hold ourselves responsible for and measure ourselves by our clients&#8217; achievement of transformational results. 

Our content, tools, and methodologies are organized into key practice areas, each offering targeted solutions that are designed to drive positive transformational results. We have divided our offerings into the following seven major practices: 

1. 

Leadership 

2. 

Execution 

3. 

Productivity 

4. 

Trust 

5. 

Sales Performance 

6. 

Customer Loyalty 

7. 

Education 

Our practices are designed to provide world-class content and delivery, including best-selling books and audio, innovative and widely recognized thought leadership, multiple delivery and teaching methods, a practice-centric focused sales force, and practice-specific marketing support. These elements allow us to offer our clients training and consulting solutions that are designed to improve individual and organizational behaviors, deliver content that adapts to an organization&#8217;s unique needs, and provide meaningful improvements in our clients&#8217; business performance. 

The following description of our practices and associated content describes what our offerings are designed to provide to our clients. The description should not be viewed as a warranty or guarantee of results. Further information about our content and services can be found on our website at www.franklincovey.com . However, the information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute a part of this annual report. 

&#160; 

&#160;

1. 

Leadership 

Dr. Stephen R. Covey, one of our co-founders, once said, &#8220;Leadership is communicating to people their worth and potential so clearly that they come to see it in themselves.&#8221; Leadership has a profound impact on performance, and is a key lever that mobilizes teams to produce results. We believe that in today&#8217;s fast-paced world, the most effective leaders address constant change with timeless principles of effectiveness and unwavering character. Leaders recognize that great leadership is not only about what they do, but about who they are. Franklin Covey&#8217;s Leadership practice develops leaders at three levels: personal, team, and organization-wide. 

Franklin Covey&#8217;s Leadership practice is designed to develop leaders who achieve sustained superior performance, engage employees to achieve the most critical objectives, win the loyalty of customers and other stakeholders, and build a strategic advantage by identifying and making a distinctive contribution. Our key leadership solutions include the following: 

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People &#174; &#8212;Signature Program 4.0 

Based on the principles found in Dr. Stephen R. Covey&#8217;s best-selling business book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People , this program was re-created and released during fiscal 2014 with refreshed content and new award-winning video presentations. This program is designed to provide training that helps organizations achieve sustained superior results by helping individuals and leaders be measurably more effective. Participants gain hands-on experience, applying timeless principles that yield greater productivity, improved communication, strengthened relationships, increased influence, and laser-like focus on critical priorities. 

The 7 Habits for Managers &#174; 

FranklinCovey&#8217;s The 7 Habits for Managers solution teaches the fundamentals of leading today&#8217;s mobile knowledge worker. Both new and experienced managers acquire a set of tools to help them meet today&#8217;s management challenges, including conflict resolution, prioritization, performance management, accountability and trust, execution, collaboration, and team and employee development. 

Leadership: Great Leaders, Great Teams, Great Results&#8482; 

This comprehensive offering contains the entire core content of Franklin Covey&#8217;s Leadership practice. The workshop features videos that present the latest on our own research and thinking, along with the best thinking of other leadership experts. 

Leadership Modular Series 

Drawn from the content of our leadership-development program, the Leadership Modular Series comprises seven stand-alone modules (of three to four hours in duration) that teach imperatives leaders can apply to create a work environment that addresses the needs of today&#8217;s knowledge worker. 

Executive Coaching 

We offer senior executives a coaching experience created in partnership with Columbia University, which includes methodologies approved by the International Coach Federation (ICF). In one-on-one or team sessions, we leverage content, methodology, and tools to guide leaders in discovering and unleashing the potential they already possess. 

2. 

Execution 

Execution remains one of the toughest challenges organizations face today. We believe that our Execution practice provides organizations with the paradigms, practices, and tools to address these challenges. We work directly with leadership teams to help them clarify the few &#8220;wildly important goals&#8221; that the execution of their strategy requires, identify the few key measures that lead to the achievement of these goals, create clear and compelling scoreboards, and build a culture and cadence of accountability so that the goals are achieved. Our key execution offerings include: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The 4 Disciplines of Execution &#174; : Manager Certification 

The purpose of manager certification includes helping managers not only develop specific skills, but to also create actual work plans. We help managers leave the session with clearly identified goals and measures, a draft scoreboard for their team, and an accountability plan to help everyone move forward on the goals. 

My4DX.com 

My4DX.com is designed to fully support the Company&#8217;s 4 Disciplines of Execution methodology. This versatile on-line service assists organizations in developing and tracking progress on &#8220;wildly important goals,&#8221; and provides a cadence of accountability to both organizations and individuals. 

What the CEO Wants You to Know: Building Business Acumen&#8482; 

This training supports the Execution practice disciplines by helping individuals and teams better understand the financial engine of their business and how they can positively affect it. The material is based on the popular book What the CEO Wants You to Know, by leading CEO and executive coach Ram Charan. 

3. 

Productivity 

Another of Franklin Covey&#8217;s co-founders, Hyrum W. Smith, taught that adherence to specified natural laws of behavior would result in increased productivity and inner peace. In today&#8217;s fast-paced world of knowledge workers &#8220;doing more with less,&#8221; we believe that workforce productivity and engagement can be a competitive advantage. Franklin Covey&#8217;s Productivity practice equips individuals, teams, and organizations to consistently make intentional high-value decisions and execute on high-impact goals and projects with excellence in the midst of unlimited choices, demands, and distractions. Our Productivity practice offerings include the following: 

The 5 Choices to Extraordinary Productivity&#8482; 

This program is designed to provide the in-depth skills, knowledge, and attitudes that allow individual contributors, teams, and organizations to be able to identify, validate, and act on what&#8217;s most important. Instead of trying to get everything done, participants focus on how to get the right things done. This discernment enables them to make wiser decisions, harness technology to enhance workflow, and put their finest attention and energy on executing what matters most. 

Project Management Essentials for the Unofficial Project Manager 

Today&#8217;s knowledge workers have quietly slipped into the role of the unofficial project manager. Stakeholder expectations, scope creep, no formal training, and a lack of process all combine to raise the probability of project failure costing organizations time, money, and employee morale. This work session helps participants consistently complete projects successfully by having them learn to implement a disciplined process to execute projects and to master informal authority of people. 

Writing Advantage &#174; 

The FranklinCovey Writing Advantage program teaches participants how to set quality writing standards that help people increase productivity, resolve issues, avoid errors, and heighten credibility. Participants learn how to write faster with more clarity, and gain skills for revising and fine-tuning every style of document. 

Presentation Advantage &#174; 

Unproductive meetings and lost opportunities may occur due to poor presentations. The lack of powerful methods to inform and persuade is one of the greatest hidden and pervasive costs of the 21 st century workplace. This work session is designed to help participants consistently deliver highly successful presentations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

4. 

Trust 

We believe that trust is the hallmark of effective leaders, teams, and organizations. Trust-related problems like bureaucracy, fraud, and excessive turnover discourage productivity, divert resources, and chip away at a company&#8217;s brand. On the other hand, leaders who make building trust an explicit goal of their job gain strategic advantages&#8212;accelerating growth, enhancing innovation, improving collaboration and execution, and increasing shareholder value. Our Trust practice is built on The New York Times best-selling book, The Speed of Trust by Stephen M. R. Covey, and includes offerings to help leaders and team members develop the competencies to make trust a strategic advantage. 

Leading at the Speed of Trust &#174; 

This program engages leaders at all levels in identifying and closing the trust gaps in their organization. Instead of paying &#8220;trust taxes,&#8221; organizations can begin to realize &#8220;trust dividends.&#8221; We believe that doing business at the &#8220;speed of trust&#8221; lowers costs, speeds up results, and increases profits and influence. 

Working at the Speed of Trust &#174; &#8212;For Associates 

This workshop helps individual contributors identify and address &#8220;trust gaps&#8221; in their personal credibility and in their relationships at work. Using examples from their work and focusing on real-world issues, participants discover how to communicate transparently with peers and managers, improve their track record of keeping commitments, focus on improving internal &#8220;customer service&#8221; with others who depend on their work, and much more. 

5. 

Sales Performance 

We believe that sales performance is about helping clients succeed. FranklinCovey provides an approach that delivers the &#8220;what to do&#8221; and &#8220;how to do&#8221; for mutual seller/buyer benefits. Through consulting, training, and coaching, our Sales Performance practice helps sales leaders and salespeople act as genuine trusted business advisors who create value and help clients succeed. 

Helping Clients Succeed &#174; is a mind-set, skill-set, and tool-set for becoming client-centered. It is a way of thinking, being, and behaving for sales professionals. We believe this content defines a process for creating candid dialogue, fresh thinking, innovative collaboration, and robust execution&#8212;with clients and within an organization. With our suite of consultative sales-training solutions, we believe clients can transform their salespeople into trusted business advisors who focus on helping their clients succeed, resulting in increased sales, shortened sales cycles, improved margins, and satisfied clients. 

6. 

Winning Customer Loyalty&#174; 

Our Customer Loyalty practice helps leaders of multiunit organizations create a culture where employees are engaged and equipped to deliver great customer experiences. To do this, customer loyalty specialists draw from an array of offerings to craft a solution that works with each company&#8217;s culture, operating environment, and strategic vision. We have partnered with Frank Reichheld, creator of the Net Promoter System TM , to help organizations measure and improve customer and employee loyalty through accurate metrics and world-class training and development. 

Our Customer Loyalty practice is designed to help organizations: 

&#183; 

Collect statistically valid feedback from a representative sample of customers and employees. 

&#183; 

Increase the visibility of customer-service metrics so managers get real-time feedback. 

&#183; 

Apply an accountability process at frontline teams so they deliver exceptional customer service at a much higher percentage of the time. 

&#183; 

Measure and improve employee engagement. 

&#160; 

7. 

Education 

The FranklinCovey Education practice is dedicated to helping educational organizations build a culture that will produce great results. Our offerings address all grade levels and help faculty and students develop the critical leadership and effectiveness skills they will need to succeed in a knowledge-based, networked world. 

Primary Education Solutions: The Leader in Me &#174; 

The Leader in Me process is designed to be integrated into a school&#8217;s core curriculum and everyday language. The methodology is designed to become part of the culture, gain momentum, and help to produce improved results year after year. We believe this methodology benefits schools and students in the following ways: 

&#183; 

Increases academic performance. 

&#183; 

Improves school culture. 

&#183; 

Decreases disciplinary issues. 

&#183; 

Increases teacher engagement and parent involvement. 

Based on Dr. Stephen R. Covey&#8217;s best-selling book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People , The Leader in Me is a whole-school transformation process that integrates principles of leadership and effectiveness into school curriculum using every day, age-appropriate language. At August 31, 2016 there were over 3,000 schools worldwide participating in The Leader in Me program and we believe that the positive results experienced by schools around the world are a major reason why the Education practice is one of our fastest growing practices. 

Secondary Education Solutions: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens &#174; 

The Introduction to The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens &#174; workshop is based on the best-selling book of the same name by Sean Covey and the No. 1 best-selling business book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People , and gives young people a set of tools to deal with life&#8217;s challenges. 

Delivery Methods 

We have multiple methods to deliver our world-class content to our clients that are designed to provide our customers with a learning environment that suits their needs. Our primary delivery methods include the following: 

&#160;

&#183;

&#183;

&#183;

&#183; 

International Licensees 

&#183;

&#183;

&#183;

&#183; 

Media Publishing 

All Access Pass 

During fiscal 2016, we launched the All Access Pass. The All Access Pass provides an intellectual property license that provides our clients access to our world-class content, assessments, tools, and videos through a web-based portal over a contracted period. Clients may use our well-known complete training programs or use individual portions of numerous offerings to customize a training or personnel solution that addresses specific organizational needs. Clients may also use our trainers and consultants in connection with AAP content and materials to further enhance the learning experience for their employees. 

Onsite Presentations 

We employ highly-talented consultants and presenters to deliver our offerings in person at client locations. Based around the world, our consultants represent diverse global industry experience and can tailor their delivery to meet a client&#8217;s precise needs. Whether the need is for consulting, training, or customized keynote speeches, our consultants can deliver our curriculums to any level 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

of an organization, from the C-suite to a team or department. We believe that our delivery consultants provide high-quality services and are a competitive advantage in the marketplace. 

Client Facilitators 

For organizations seeking cost-effective ways to implement solutions involving large populations of managers and frontline workers, FranklinCovey certifies on-site client facilitators to teach our content and adapt it to their organizational needs. We have thousands of client facilitators around the world who are certified to teach in different content areas. In order to become a client facilitator, an individual must become certified to teach our offerings through a two-step process that is designed to ensure that these trained personnel can deliver our content in a professional and meaningful manner. 

International Licensees 

In foreign countries where we do not have an office, our content is delivered through independent licensees, who, under strict guidelines, may translate and adapt our offerings to local preferences and customs, if necessary. These licensee partners allow us to deliver the same high quality content to clients that have multinational operations or in countries that have specific cultural requirements. Our licensee partners pay us a royalty based on the programs and content delivered. 

E-Learning 

Our E-Learning capabilities bring our content to clients in innovative ways that transcend traditional E-learning solutions. Franklin Covey&#8217;s online offerings allow participants to save travel time and expenses as well as providing the opportunity to view our content in smaller time increments. 

Public Workshops 

Each year, we offer a number of training events, primarily in the United States and Canada, which are open to the public. Prior to the event, we advertise in the geographic region where the event will be held and participants may register for the events in advance. Interested persons may also search for upcoming workshops based on the desired curriculum and register for these workshops through our website at www.franklincovey.com . In addition, our content is taught by certain professional training firms that also offer events to the public. 

Custom Solutions 

Whether clients need a program customized, or require a new product developed for their organization, our custom solutions department has the process to build the solution. Content customization builds upon our existing offerings and our clients&#8217; unique needs by using a specific process to deliver results and improve training return on investment for our clients. 

Media Publishing 

Our Media Publishing department extends our influence into both traditional publishing and new media channels. FranklinCovey Media Publishing offers books, e-books, audio products, downloadable and paper-based tools, and content-rich software applications for smart phones and other handheld devices to consumer and corporate markets. 

Industry Information 

According to the Training magazine 2016 Training Industry Survey, the total size of the U.S. training industry is estimated to be $70.7 billion, which is essentially flat compared with the prior year. One of our competitive advantages in this highly fragmented industry stems from our fully integrated principle-centered training offerings, measurement methodologies, and implementation tools to help organizations and individuals measurably improve their effectiveness. This advantage 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

allows us to deliver not only training to both corporations and individuals, but also to implement the training through the use of powerful behavior-changing tools with the capability to then measure the impact of the delivered content and solutions. 

Over our history, we have provided content, services, and products to 97 of the Fortune 100 companies and more than 75 percent of the Fortune 500 companies. We also provide content and services to a number of U.S. and foreign governmental agencies, as well as numerous educational institutions. In addition, we provide training content, measurement services, and implementation tools internationally, either through directly operated offices, or through independent licensed providers. 

Segment Information 

Our sales are primarily comprised of training and content sales and related products. Effective September 1, 2015, we changed our organizational structure to create four operating divisions, which were determined to be operating segments, and a corporate services group. The following is a brief description of these new reportable segments: 

&#183; 

Direct Offices &#8211; This segment consists of our geographic sales offices that serve the United States and Canada; our international sales offices located in Japan, the United Kingdom, and Australia; and our public programs group. This division will include our new sales offices in China that were opened on September 1, 2016. 

&#183; 

Strategic Markets &#8211; This segment includes our government services office, the Sales Performance practice, the Customer Loyalty practice, and a new &#8220;Global 50&#8221; group, which is specifically focused on sales to large, multi-national organizations. 

&#183; 

Education practice &#8211; This segment is comprised of our domestic and international Education practice operations, which are centered on sales to educational institutions such as elementary schools, high schools, and colleges and universities. 

&#183; 

International Licensees &#8211; This segment is primarily comprised of our international licensees&#8217; royalty revenues. 

For financial and other information regarding our operating segments, refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements (Note 16). 

Clients 

We have a relatively broad base of organizational and individual clients. In our direct offices that serve the United States, Canada, Japan, China, Australia, and the United Kingdom, we have more than 5,100 organizational clients consisting of corporations, governmental agencies, educational institutions, and other organizations. We have thousands of additional organizational clients throughout the world, which are served through our global licensee partner network, and we believe that our content, in all its forms, delivers results that encourage strong client loyalty. Employees in each of our domestic and international distribution channels focus on helping our clients achieve measurably positive results from utilizing our content. Due to the nature of our business, we do not have a significant backlog of firm orders. 

During the periods presented in this report, none of our clients were responsible for more than ten percent of our consolidated revenues. 

Competition 

We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and compete with a variety of organizations that offer services comparable with those that we offer. The nature of the competition in the performance improvement industry, however, is highly fragmented with few large competitors. Based upon our fiscal 2016 consolidated sales of $200.1 million, we believe that we are a leading competitor in the performance skills and education market. Other significant comparative companies in the performance improvement market are Development Dimensions International, CRA International, Inc., Learning Tree International Inc., GP Strategies Corp., FTI 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Consulting, Inc., American Management Association, Wilson Learning, Forum Corporation, Corporate Executive Board Co., The Hackett Group, and the Center for Creative Leadership. 

We derive our revenues from a variety of companies with a broad range of sales volumes, governments, educational institutions, and other entities. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industry in which we compete include the following: 

&#183; 

Quality of offerings, services, and solutions 

&#183; 

Skills and capabilities of people 

&#183; 

Innovative training and consulting services combined with effective products 

&#183; 

Ability to add value to client operations 

&#183; 

Reputation and client references 

&#183; 

Price 

&#183; 

Availability of appropriate resources 

&#183; 

Global reach and scale 

&#183; 

Branding and name recognition in our marketplace 

Given the relative ease of entry into the training market, the number of our competitors could increase, many of whom may imitate existing methods of distribution, or could offer similar content and programs at lower prices. Some of these competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do. However, we believe that we have several areas of competitive differentiation in our industry. We believe that our competitive advantages include: (1) the quality of our content, as indicated by our strong gross margins, branded content, and best-selling books; (2) the breadth of delivery options we are able to offer to customers for utilizing our content, including live presentations by our own training consultants, live presentations though Company certified client-employed facilitators, intellectual property licensing and the All Access Pass, web-based presentations, and film-based presentations; (3) our global reach, which allows truly multinational clients to scale our content uniformly across the globe, through our mix of direct offices and our global licensee network; and (4) the significant impact which our solutions can have on our clients&#8217; results. Moreover, we believe that we are a market leader in the U.S. in leadership, execution, productivity, and individual effectiveness content. Increased competition from existing and future competitors could, however, have a negative impact on our sales and profitability in future fiscal years. 

Seasonality 

Our fourth quarter of each fiscal year typically has higher sales and operating income than other fiscal quarters primarily due to increased revenues in our Education practice (when school administrators and faculty have professional development days) and to increased facilitator sales that typically occur during that quarter resulting from year-end incentive programs. Overall, training sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training, which is not typically scheduled as heavily during holiday and certain vacation periods. 

Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new offerings, business acquisitions, the addition of new organizational customers, and the elimination of underperforming offerings. 

Manufacturing and Distribution 

We do not manufacture any of our products. We purchase our training materials and related products from various vendors and suppliers located both domestically and internationally, and we are not dependent upon any one vendor for the production of our training and related materials as the raw materials for these products are readily available. We currently believe that we have good relationships with our suppliers and contractors. 

&#160; 

During fiscal 2016 we entered into a three-year contract with HP Enterprise Services (HPE) to provide warehousing and distribution services for our training products and related accessories. Our materials are primarily warehoused and distributed from an HPE facility located in Des Moines, Iowa. 

Trademarks, Copyrights, and Intellectual Property 

Our success has resulted in part from our proprietary content, methodologies, and other intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, copyrights, and confidentiality agreements. We claim rights for over 550 trademarks in the United States and foreign countries, and we have obtained registration in the United States and numerous foreign countries for many of our trademarks including FranklinCovey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, The 4 Disciplines of Execution , and The 7 Habits . We consider our trademarks and other proprietary rights to be important and material to our business. 

We own sole or joint copyrights on our books, manuals, text and other printed information provided in our training programs, and other electronic media products, including audio and video tapes. We may license, rather than sell, facilitator workbooks and other seminar and training materials in order to protect our intellectual property rights therein. We place trademark and copyright notices on our instructional, marketing, and advertising materials. In order to maintain the proprietary nature of our product information, we enter into written confidentiality agreements with certain executives, product developers, sales professionals, training consultants, other employees, and licensees. Although we believe the protective measures with respect to our proprietary rights are important, there can be no assurance that such measures will provide significant protection from competitors. 

Employees 

One of our most important assets is our people. The diverse and global makeup of our workforce allows us to serve a variety of clients on a worldwide basis. We are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining quality personnel and actively strive to reinforce our employees&#8217; commitment to our clients, and to our mission, vision, culture, and values through the creation of a motivational and rewarding work environment. 

We currently have approximately 870 associates located in the United States of America, Canada, China, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Australia. None of our associates are represented by a union or other collective bargaining group. Management believes that its relations with its associates are good and we do not currently foresee a shortage in qualified personnel needed to operate and grow our business.
