ITEM 1. BUSINESS GENERAL 

Lamar Advertising Company is one of the largest outdoor advertising companies in the United States based on number of displays and has operated under the Lamar name since 1902. We operate in a single operating and reporting segment, advertising. We lease space for advertising on billboards, buses, shelters, benches, logo plates and in airport terminals. We offer our customers a fully integrated service, satisfying all aspects of their billboard display requirements from ad copy production to placement and maintenance. 

We operate three types of outdoor advertising displays: billboards, logo signs and transit advertising displays. 

Billboards. As of December 31, 2015, we owned and operated approximately 144,000 billboard advertising displays in 44 states, Canada and Puerto Rico. We lease most of our advertising space on two types of billboards: bulletins and posters. 

- Bulletins are generally large, illuminated advertising structures that are located on major highways and target vehicular traffic. 

- Posters are generally smaller advertising structures that are located on major traffic arteries and city streets and target vehicular and pedestrian traffic. 

Table of Contents In addition to traditional billboards, we also lease space on digital billboards, which are generally located on major traffic arteries and city streets. As of December 31, 2015, we owned and operated approximately 2,300 digital billboard advertising displays in 42 states, Canada and Puerto Rico. 

Logo signs. We lease advertising space on logo signs located near highway exits. 

- Logo signs generally advertise nearby gas, food, camping, lodging and other attractions. We are the largest provider of logo signs in the United States, operating 23 of the 26 privatized state logo sign contracts. As of December 31, 2015, we operated approximately 134,000 logo sign advertising displays in 23 states and Canada. 

Transit advertising displays. We also lease advertising space on the exterior and interior of public transportation vehicles, in airport terminals, and on transit shelters and benches in approximately 75 markets. As of December 31, 2015, we operated over 42,000 transit advertising displays in 18 states, Canada and Puerto Rico. 

CORPORATE HISTORY 

We have operated under the Lamar name since our founding in 1902 and have been publicly traded on NASDAQ under the symbol &#147;LAMR&#148; since 1996. We completed a reorganization on July 20, 1999 that created a holding company structure. At that time, the operating company (then called Lamar Advertising Company) was renamed Lamar Media Corp., and all of the operating company&#146;s stockholders became stockholders of a new holding company. The new holding company then took the Lamar Advertising Company name, and Lamar Media Corp. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Lamar Advertising Company. 

During 2014, we completed a reorganization in order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As part of the plan to reorganize our business operations so that we could elect to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year commencing January 1, 2014, we completed a merger with our predecessor that was approved by our stockholders on November 17, 2014. At the time of the merger each outstanding share of our predecessor&#146;s Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Series AA preferred stock was converted into the right to receive an equal number of shares of Class A common stock, Class B common and Series AA preferred stock of the surviving corporation, respectively. Accordingly, references herein to our Class A common stock, Class B common and Series AA preferred stock refer to our capital stock and the capital stock of our predecessor, as applicable. We hold and operate certain assets through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (&#147;TRSs&#148;). The non-REIT qualified businesses that we hold through TRSs include most of our transit and foreign operations. 

We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be treated as qualified REIT subsidiaries or other disregarded entities (&#147;QRSs&#148;), and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our TRSs to other subsidiaries, including QRSs. 

In this Annual Report, unless the context otherwise requires, we refer to Lamar Advertising Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (and its predecessor and its consolidated subsidiaries), as applicable, as the &#147;Company&#148;, &#147;Lamar Advertising&#148; or &#147;we&#148;, we refer to Lamar Advertising&#146;s wholly owned subsidiary Lamar Media Corp. as &#147;Lamar Media.&#148; 

OPERATING STRATEGIES 

We strive to be a leading provider of outdoor advertising services in each of the markets that we serve, and our operating strategies for achieving that goal include: 

Continuing to provide high quality local sales and service . We seek to identify and closely monitor the needs of our tenants and to provide them with a full complement of high quality advertising services. Local advertising constituted approximately 79% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, which management believes is higher than the industry average. We believe that the experience of our regional, territory and local managers has contributed greatly to our success. For example, our regional managers have been with us for an average of 32 years. In an effort to provide high quality sales and service at the local level, we employed approximately 890 local account executives as of December 31, 2015. Local account executives are typically supported by additional local staff and have the ability to draw upon the resources of our central office, as well as our offices in other markets, in the event business opportunities or customers&#146; needs support such an allocation of resources. 

Table of Contents Continuing a centralized control and decentralized management structure. Our management believes that, for our particular business, centralized control and a decentralized organization provide for greater economies of scale and are more responsive to local market demands. Therefore, we maintain centralized accounting and financial control over our local operations, but our local managers are responsible for the day-to-day operations in each local market and are compensated according to that market&#146;s financial performance. 

Continuing to focus on internal growth. Within our existing markets, we seek to increase our revenue and improve cash flow by employing highly-targeted local marketing efforts to improve our display occupancy rates and by increasing advertising rates where and when demand can absorb rate increases. Our local offices spearhead this effort and respond to local customer demands quickly. 

In addition, we routinely invest in upgrading our existing displays and constructing new displays. Since January 1, 2006, we invested approximately $1.3 billion in capitalized expenditures, which include improvements to our existing real estate portfolio and the construction of new locations. Our regular improvement and expansion of our advertising display inventory allows us to provide high quality service to our current tenants and to attract new tenants. 

Continuing to pursue other outdoor advertising opportunities. We plan to renew existing logo sign contracts and pursue additional logo sign contracts. Logo sign opportunities arise periodically, both from states initiating new logo sign programs and states converting from government-owned and operated programs to privately-owned and operated programs. Furthermore, we plan to pursue additional tourist oriented directional sign programs in both the United States and Canada and also other motorist information signing programs as opportunities present themselves. In addition, in an effort to maintain market share, we continue to pursue attractive transit advertising opportunities as they become available. 

Reinvesting in capital expenditures including digital technology . We have historically invested in capital expenditures, however, during 2009 and 2010, we significantly reduced our capital expenditures to position the Company to manage through the economic recession. As a result of the economic recovery, the Company began to reinvest in capital expenditures beginning in 2011. We spent approximately $110.4 million in total capital expenditures in fiscal 2015, of which approximately $50.0 million was spent on digital technology. We expect our 2016 capitalized expenditures to closely approximate our spending in 2015. 

CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY 

The objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital. To maintain our REIT status we are required to distribute to our stockholders annually an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income. After complying with our REIT distribution requirements, we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria. During 2015, we generated $477.7 million of cash from operating activities, which was used to fund $153.9 million of acquisitions and $110.4 million of capital expenditures. In addition, in 2015, we paid regular cash distributions in the aggregate of approximately $265.5 million to our stockholders. 

- Capital expenditures program . We will continue to reinvest in our existing assets and expand our outdoor advertising display portfolio through new construction. This includes maintenance and growth capital expenditures associated with the construction of new billboard displays, the entrance into and renewal of logo sign and transit contracts, and the purchase of real estate and operating equipment. 

- Acquisitions . We will seek to pursue strategic acquisitions of outdoor advertising businesses and assets. This includes acquisitions in our existing markets and in new markets where we can meet our return on investment criteria. When evaluating investments in new markets, our return on investment criteria reflects the additional risks inherent to the particular geographic area. COMPANY OPERATIONS 

Billboard Advertising 

We lease most of our advertising space on two types of billboard advertising displays: bulletins and posters. As of December 31, 2015, we owned and operated approximately 144,000 billboard advertising displays in 44 states, Canada and Puerto Rico. In 2015, we derived approximately 73% of our billboard advertising net revenues from bulletin rentals and 27% from poster rentals. 

Bulletins are large, advertising structures (the most common size is fourteen feet high by forty-eight feet wide, or 672 square feet) consisting of panels on which advertising copy is displayed. We wrap advertising copy printed with computer-generated graphics on a single sheet of vinyl around the structure. To attract more attention, some of the panels may extend beyond the linear edges of the display face and may include three-dimensional embellishments. Because of their greater impact and higher cost, bulletins are usually located on major highways and target vehicular traffic. At December 31, 2015, we operated approximately 67,200 bulletin displays. 

Table of Contents We generally lease individually-selected bulletin space to advertisers for the duration of the contract (usually one to twelve months). We also lease bulletins as part of a rotary plan under which we rotate the advertising copy from one bulletin location to another within a particular market at stated intervals (usually every sixty to ninety days) to achieve greater reach within that market. 

Posters are smaller advertising structures (the most common size is eleven feet high by twenty-three feet wide, or 250 square feet; we also operate junior posters, which are five feet high by eleven feet wide, or 55 square feet). Poster panels utilize a single flexible sheet of polyethylene material that inserts into the face of the panel. Posters are concentrated on major traffic arteries and target vehicular traffic, and junior posters are concentrated on city streets and target hard-to-reach pedestrian traffic and nearby residents. At December 31, 2015, we operated approximately 74,300 poster displays. 

We generally lease poster space for thirty- and sixty-day periods in packages called &#147;showings,&#148; which comprise a given number of displays in a specified market area. We place and spread out the displays making up a showing in well-traveled areas to reach a wide audience in the particular market. 

In addition to the traditional displays described above, we also rent digital billboards. Digital billboards are large electronic light emitting diode (&#147;LED&#148;) displays (the most common sizes are fourteen feet high by forty feet wide, or 560 square feet; ten and a half feet high by thirty six feet wide, or 378 square feet; and ten feet high by twenty-one feet wide, or 210 square feet) that are generally located on major traffic arteries and city streets. Digital billboards are capable of generating over one billion colors and vary in brightness based on ambient conditions. They display completely digital advertising copy from various advertisers in a slide show fashion, rotating each advertisement approximately every 6 to 8 seconds. At December 31, 2015, we operated approximately 2,300 digital billboards in various markets, which represents approximately 19% of billboard advertising net revenue. 

We own the physical structures on which the advertising copy is displayed. We build the structures on locations we either own or lease. In each local office, one employee typically performs site leasing activities for the markets served by that office. See Item 2. &#151; &#147;Properties.&#148; 

In the majority of our markets, our local production staffs perform the full range of activities required to create and install billboard advertising displays. Production work includes creating the advertising copy design and layout, coordinating its printing and installing the designs on the displays. Our talented design staff uses state-of-the-art technology to prepare creative, eye-catching displays for our tenants. We can also help with the strategic placement of advertisements throughout an advertiser&#146;s market by using software that allows us to analyze the target audience and its demographics. Our artists also assist in developing marketing presentations, demonstrations and strategies to attract new tenant advertisers. 

In marketing billboard displays to advertisers, we compete with other forms of out-of-home advertising and other media. When selecting the media and provider through which to advertise, advertisers consider a number of factors and advertising providers, which are described in the section entitled &#151; &#147;Competition&#148; below. 

Logo Sign Advertising 

We entered the logo sign advertising business in 1988 and have become the largest provider of logo sign services in the United States, operating 23 of the 26 privatized state logo contracts. We erect logo signs, which generally advertise nearby gas, food, camping, lodging and other attractions, and directional signs, which direct vehicle traffic to nearby services and tourist attractions, near highway exits. As of December 31, 2015, we operated over 41,900 logo sign structures containing approximately 134,000 logo advertising displays in the United States and Canada. 

We operate the logo sign contracts in the province of Ontario, Canada and in the following states: 

Colorado

Georgia

Louisiana

Minnesota

Montana

New Jersey

Oklahoma

Delaware

Kansas

Maine

Mississippi

Nebraska

New Mexico

South Carolina

Florida

Kentucky

Michigan

Missouri (1) 

Nevada

Ohio

Utah

Virginia

Wisconsin

(1) The logo sign contract in Missouri is operated by a 66 2/3% owned partnership. We also operate the tourist oriented directional signing (&#147;TODS&#148;) programs for the states of Colorado, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina, Virginia and the province of Ontario, Canada. 

Table of Contents Our logo and TODS operations are decentralized. Generally, each office is staffed with an experienced local general manager, local sales and office staff and a local signing sub-contractor. This decentralization allows the management staff of Interstate Logos, L.L.C. (the subsidiary that operates all of the logo and directional sign-related businesses) to travel extensively to the various operations and serve in a technical and management advisory capacity and monitor regulatory and contract compliance. We also run a silk screening operation in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and a display construction company in Atlanta, Georgia. 

State logo sign contracts represent the exclusive right to erect and operate logo signs within a state for a period of time. The terms of the contracts vary, but generally range from five to ten years, with additional renewal terms. Each logo sign contract generally allows the state to terminate the contract prior to its expiration and, in most cases, with compensation for the termination to be paid to the Company. When a logo sign contract expires, we transfer ownership of the advertising structures to the state. Depending on the contract, we may or may not be entitled to compensation at that time. Of our 24 logo sign contracts in place, in the United States and Canada, at December 31, 2015, five are subject to renewal in 2016 . 

States usually award new logo sign contracts and renew expiring logo sign contracts through an open proposal process. In bidding for new and renewal contracts, we compete against other logo sign providers, as well as local companies based in the state soliciting proposals. 

In marketing logo signs to advertisers, we compete with other forms of out-of-home advertising and other media. When selecting the media and provider through which to advertise, advertisers consider a number of factors and advertising providers which are described in the section entitled &#151; &#147;Competition&#148; below. 

Transit Advertising 

We entered into the transit advertising business in 1993 as a way to complement our existing business and maintain market share in certain markets. Transit contracts are generally with the local municipalities and airport authorities and allow us the exclusive right to rent advertising space to customers, in airports and on buses, benches or shelters. The terms of the contracts vary but generally range between 3-15 years, many with renewable options for contract extension. We rent transit advertising displays in airport terminals and on bus shelters, benches and buses in approximately 75 transit markets, and our production staff provides a full range of creative and installation services to our transit advertising tenants. As of December 31, 2015, we operated over 42,000 transit advertising displays in 18 states, Canada and Puerto Rico. 

Municipalities usually award new transit advertising contracts and renew expiring transit advertising contracts through an open bidding process. In bidding for new and renewal contracts, we compete against national outdoor advertising providers and local, on-premise sign providers and sign construction companies. Transit advertising operators incur significant start-up costs to build and install the advertising structures (such as transit shelters) upon being awarded contracts. 

In marketing transit advertising displays to advertisers, we compete with other forms of out-of-home advertising and other media. When selecting the media and provider through which to advertise, advertisers consider a number of factors and advertising providers which are described in the section entitled &#151; &#147;Competition&#148; below. 

COMPETITION 

Although the outdoor advertising industry has encountered a wave of consolidation, the industry remains fragmented. The industry is comprised of several large outdoor advertising and media companies with operations in multiple markets, as well as smaller, local companies operating a limited number of structures in one or a few local markets. 

Although we primarily focus on small to mid-size markets where we can attain a strong market share, in each of our markets, we compete against other providers of outdoor advertising and other types of media, including: 

- Larger outdoor advertising providers, such as (i) Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc., which operates billboards, street furniture displays, transit displays and other out-of-home advertising displays and (ii) Outfront Media, Inc. (formerly CBS Outdoor), which operates traditional outdoor, street furniture and transit advertising properties. Clear Channel Outdoor and Outfront Media each have corporate relationships with large media conglomerates and may have greater total resources, product offerings and opportunities for cross-selling than we do. 

- Broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail marketing, the internet, social media and applications used in conjunction with wireless devices. 

- An increasing variety of out-of-home advertising media, such as advertising displays in shopping centers, malls, airports, stadiums, movie theaters, supermarkets and advertising displays on taxis, trains and buses. 

Table of Contents In selecting the form of media through which to advertise, advertisers evaluate their ability to target audiences having a specific demographic profile, lifestyle, brand or media consumption or purchasing behavior or audiences located in, or traveling through, a particular geography. Advertisers also compare the relative costs of available media, evaluating the number of impressions (potential viewings), exposure (the opportunity for advertising to be seen) and circulation (traffic volume in a market), as well as potential effectiveness, quality of related services (such as advertising copy design and layout) and customer service. In competing with other media, we believe that outdoor advertising is relatively more cost-efficient than other media, allowing advertisers to reach broader audiences and target specific geographic areas or demographic groups within markets. 

We believe that our strong emphasis on sales and customer service and our position as a major provider of advertising services in each of our primary markets enables us to compete effectively with the other outdoor advertising companies, as well as with other media, within those markets. 

GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION 

Our advertising displays are geographically diversified across the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. The following table sets forth information regarding the geographic diversification of our advertising displays, which are listed in order of contributions to total revenue. Markets with less than 1% of total displays are grouped in the category &#147;all other United States and Puerto Rico&#148;.

Table of Contents TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES 

We hold and operate certain of our assets that cannot be held and operated directly by a REIT through taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs. A TRS is a subsidiary of a REIT that pays corporate taxes on its taxable income. The assets held in our TRSs primarily consist of our transit advertising business, advertising services business and our foreign operations in Canada and Puerto Rico. Our TRS assets and operations will continue to be subject, as applicable, to U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes. Furthermore, our assets and operations outside the United States will continue to be subject to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located. Net income from our TRSs will either be retained by our TRSs and used to fund their operations, or distributed to us, where it will be reinvested in our business or be available for distribution to Lamar Advertising&#146;s stockholders. As of December 31, 2015, the annual revenue generated by our TRSs in the aggregate was approximately $232 million. 

ADVERTISING TENANTS 

Our tenant base is diverse. The table below sets forth the ten industries from which we derived most of our billboard advertising revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as the percentage of billboard advertising revenues attributable to the advertisers in those industries. The individual advertisers in these industries accounted for approximately 78% of our billboard advertising net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2015. No individual tenant accounted for more than 1.0% of our billboard advertising net revenues in that period.

78 % REGULATION 

Outdoor advertising is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Regulations generally restrict the size, spacing, lighting and other aspects of advertising structures and pose a significant barrier to entry and expansion in many markets. 

Federal law, principally the Highway Beautification Act of 1965 (the &#147;HBA&#148;), regulates outdoor advertising on Federal &#151; Aid Primary, Interstate and National Highway Systems roads. The HBA requires states, through the adoption of individual Federal/State agreements, to &#147;effectively control&#148; outdoor advertising along these roads, and mandates a state compliance program and state standards regarding size, spacing and lighting. The HBA requires any state or political subdivision that compels the removal of a lawful billboard along a Federal &#151; Aid Primary or Interstate highway to pay just compensation to the billboard owner. 

All states have passed billboard control statutes and regulations at least as restrictive as the federal requirements, including laws requiring the removal of illegal signs at the owner&#146;s expense (and without compensation from the state). Although we believe that the number of our billboards that may be subject to removal as illegal is immaterial, and no state in which we operate has banned billboards entirely, from time to time governments have required us to remove signs and billboards legally erected in accordance with federal, state and local permit requirements and laws. Municipal and county governments generally also have sign controls as part of their zoning laws and building codes. We contest laws and regulations that we believe unlawfully restrict our constitutional or other legal rights and may adversely impact the growth of our outdoor advertising business. 

Using federal funding for transportation enhancement programs, state governments have purchased and removed billboards for beautification, and may do so again in the future. Under the power of eminent domain, state or municipal governments have laid claim to property and forced the removal of billboards. Under a concept called amortization by which a governmental body asserts that a billboard operator has earned compensation by continued operation over time, local governments have attempted to force removal of legal but nonconforming billboards (i.e., billboards that conformed with applicable zoning regulations when built but which do not conform to current zoning regulations). Although the legality of amortization is questionable, it has been upheld in some instances. Often, municipal and county governments also have sign controls as part of their zoning laws, with some local governments prohibiting construction of new billboards or allowing new construction only to replace existing structures. Although we have generally been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for those of our billboards purchased or removed as a result of governmental action, there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future. 

Table of Contents We have also introduced and intend to continue to expand the deployment of digital billboards that display static digital advertising copy from various advertisers that change every 6 to 8 seconds. We have encountered some existing regulations that restrict or prohibit these types of digital displays but it has not yet materially impacted our digital deployment. Since digital billboards have only recently been developed and introduced into the market on a large scale, existing regulations that currently do not apply to them by their terms could be revised to impose greater restrictions. These regulations may impose greater restrictions on digital billboards due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety. 

In January 2013, Scenic America, Inc., a nonprofit membership organization, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The complaint alleged that (i) the FHWA exceeded its authority when the agency issued the 2007 Guidance to assist its division offices in evaluating state regulations that authorize the construction and operation of digital billboards that are in conformance with restrictions on &#147;intermittent&#148;, &#147;flashing&#148; or &#147;moving&#148; lights, which restrictions are contained in the individual Federal/State Agreements that implement the provisions of the HBA and in issuing the 2007 Guidance, the FHWA violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) by not first engaging in formal rulemaking, (ii) the 2007 Guidance violated the HBA because it adopted &#147;a new lighting standard&#148; without first amending the provisions of the Federal/State Agreements and (iii) the 2007 Guidance violates the HBA (the &#147;2007 Guidance&#148;) because digital billboards are themselves &#147;inconsistent with customary use&#148; of outdoor advertising, as that term is used in the HBA. As the principal remedy for these alleged violations, the complaint sought an injunction vacating the 2007 Guidance. On June 20, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed all challenges made by Scenic America to the 2007 Guidance finding that (i) the 2007 Guidance was an interpretive and not a substantive rule and, therefore, did not violate the APA, (ii) the 2007 Guidance did not infringe on the Federal/State Agreements and (iii) the 2007 Guidance is consistent with &#147;customary use&#148; and, therefore, did not violate the HBA. Scenic America filed a notice of appeal from the District Court&#146;s judgment to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on August 7, 2014. This appeal is pending as of February 23, 2016. 

On December 30, 2013, USDOT and FHWA published a Notice encouraging states to work with the FHWA to review their Federal/State Agreements, most of which were put in place in the late 1960s and early 1970s, to determine if amendments are advisable. FHWA encouraged each state to work with their FHWA division offices to amend its Federal/State Agreement so that it is consistent with the state&#146;s current outdoor advertising objectives and address the evolving technology being used or that could be used in the future by the outdoor industry. The Notice details a multi-step process to achieve this goal. The Notice does not make any reference to the 2007 Guidance, nor does it recommend or require any specific substantive amendments to a state&#146;s Federal/State Agreement. It is uncertain whether the FHWA Notice will have any impact on current federal, state or local regulation of outdoor advertising signs or on the above referenced Scenic America law suit. To the extent that any Federal/State Agreements are amended in a manner that places new restrictions on outdoor advertising it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 

Relatively few large scale studies have been conducted to date regarding driver safety issues, if any, related to digital billboards. On December 30, 2013, the results of a study conducted by USDOT and FHWA that looked at the effect of digital billboards and conventional billboards on driver visual behavior were issued. The conclusions of the report indicated that the presence of digital billboards did not appear to be related to a decrease in looking toward the road ahead and were generally within acceptable thresholds. The report cautioned, however, that it adds to the knowledge base but does not present definitive answers to the research questions investigated. Accordingly, the results of this or other studies may result in regulations at the federal or state level that impose greater restrictions on digital billboards. Any new restrictions on digital billboards could have a material adverse effect on both our existing inventory of digital billboards and our plans to expand our digital deployment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business, including disputes involving advertising contracts, site leases, employment claims and construction matters. We are also involved in routine administrative and judicial proceedings regarding billboard permits, fees and compensation for condemnations. We are not a party to any lawsuit or proceeding which, in the opinion of management, is likely to have a material adverse effect on us. 

Table of Contents REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO 

Our management headquarters is located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. We also own 117 local operating facilities with front office administration and sales office space connected to back-shop poster and bulletin production space. In addition, we lease an additional 127 operating facilities at an aggregate lease expense for 2015 of approximately $7.6 million. 

We own approximately 7,100 parcels of property beneath our advertising displays. As of December 31, 2015, we leased over 75,000 outdoor sites, accounting for an annualized lease expense of approximately $225.7 million. This amount represented approximately 19% of billboard advertising net revenues for that period. These leases are for varying terms ranging from month-to-month to a term of over ten years, and many provide us with renewal options. Our lease agreements generally permit us to use the land for the construction, repair and relocation of outdoor advertising displays, including all rights necessary to access and maintain the site. Approximately 64% of our leases will expire or be subject to renewal in the next 5 years, 13% will expire or be subject to renewal in 6 to 10 years and 23% thereafter. There is no significant concentration of displays under any one lease or subject to negotiation with any one landlord. An important part of our management activity is to manage our lease portfolio and negotiate suitable lease renewals and extensions. 

The following table illustrates the number of leased and owned sites by state as of December 31, 2015, which is sorted from greatest to least in number and percentage of leased sites. States in which we lease less than 2% of our portfolio are grouped in the category &#147;All Other States&#148;.

75,000 100 % 7,183 100 % CONTRACT EXPIRATIONS 

We derive revenues primarily from renting advertising space to customers on our advertising displays. Our contracts with customers generally cover periods ranging from one week to one year and are generally billed every four weeks. Since contract terms are short-term in nature, we do not consider revenues by year of contract expiration to be meaningful. 

EMPLOYEES 

We employed approximately 3,200 people as of December 31, 2015. Approximately 225 employees were engaged in overall management and general administration at our management headquarters in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and the remainder, including approximately 890 local account executives were employed in our operating offices. 

Thirteen of our local offices employ billposters and construction personnel who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relationship with our employees, including our 107 unionized employees, is good, and we have never experienced a strike or work stoppage. 

INFLATION 

In the last three years, inflation has not had a significant impact on us. 

Table of Contents SEASONALITY 

Our revenues and operating results are subject to seasonality. Typically, we experience our strongest financial performance in the summer and fall, and our weakest financial performance in the first quarter of the calendar year, partly because retailers cut back their advertising spending immediately following the holiday shopping season. We expect this trend to continue in the future. Because a significant portion of our expenses is fixed, a reduction in revenues in any quarter is likely to result in a period-to-period decline in operating performance and net earnings.
