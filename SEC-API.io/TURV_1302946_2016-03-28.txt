 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

Overview 

Our core business acquires farmland with senior water rights and converts this farmland from traditional use of growing marginally profitable feed crops to growing fruit and vegetable crops that generate higher yield, revenue and operating margins. We also deploy excess land and water to other associated business opportunities. Currently, this expansion includes the development of 157 acres in Pueblo county Colorado into a greenhouse and processing facility to lease to cannabis growers. 

In the short-term, our business model is designed to provide us with increased profitability and cash flow that is enabling us to expand our operations by acquiring and developing additional irrigated farmland and associated water rights and infrastructure. In the longer term, we believe our ability and willingness to pay a higher price for water will increase our access to water. Potentially some of our water rights can be provision to municipalities to address their supply challenges. We seek to concentrate our acquisitions on water rights and infrastructure that are, in part, owned by municipalities, which can alleviate and expedite the legal and political processes necessary for municipal consumers to obtain excess water. 

In the semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States , prices for municipal water can be five to ten times the price of irrigation water and that price differential may be amplified in the near future as the result of a predicted water supply shortage for municipalities . First-generation western water business models attempted to arbitrage the price differential between irrigation water and municipal water by &#147;buying and drying&#148; irrigated farmland in order to sell irrigation water to municipalities. This practice , under which some of the most productive irrigated farmland would be fallowed, decimated entire agricultural communities and led to political and legal challenges that ultimately made the practice untenable. In the late nineteenth century, agricultural interests were granted approximately 85% of all water rights in the State of Colorado, and those water rights continue to be held primarily by agriculture interests. Since the late nineteenth century, populations have increased and people have moved from farms to cities, resulting in a water shortage for municipalities .

We believe our business model, which we currently are implementing in the Arkansas River Basin in Colorado, is a more viable and sustainable solution than the &#147;buy and dry&#148; practices of the past. Market transactions between buyers and sellers from both the agricultural and municipal communities, rather than unending political and legal processes, are the driving force behind our model. We create new and better paying jobs for farming, marketing, handling and processing fruits and vegetables , which can reinvigorate the agricultural communities where we operate, and in the longer term we intend to wholesale to municipal communities any excess water not needed for our core agricultural business.

Our farm revenuesremained essentially the same from 2014 to 2015 at $2.4 million. We began acquiring and developing irrigated farmland and associated water rights and infrastructure in 2009, and as of December 31, 2015 we owned 7,350 gross acres. As capital permits, we will seek to expand our holdings by strategically acquiring or leasing irrigable farmland in the Arkansas River Basin. 

In 2015, we farmed a total of 973 gross acres, of which 661gross acres were planted and 312 acres were the subject of federal crop insurance payments, preventive planting and planting of sorghum to be plowed under to renourish the soil.We intend to develop and bring into production more of our currently held gross acres as we acquire additional water rights. Our crop production consisted of cabbage, pumpkins and squash grown for human consumption, as well as feed crops, such as corn and sorghum, planted as part of our crop rotation practice. We expect to increase the variety of crops we produce as we continue to expand our farming operations through acreage we manage and through our network of growers. Our produce marketing operations package and ship produce for our farms and for a network of farmers who grow crops for us , and to date we have sold our fruits and vegetables principally to national accounts.

In 2014 we initiated a corporate restructuring pursuant to which are organizing substantially all of our operations under the control of TR Capital Partners, LLC, or TR Capital. This restructuring better reflects our emphasis on acquiring and operating irrigated farming and water distribution activities under our integrated business model. 

&#160;

Table of Con tents 

TR Capital issued all of its common units to the Parent Company and, as of March 20, 2015, had issued a total of 30,158,815 preferred units in exchange for aggregate consideration consisting of $6.0 million in cash and $18.9 million of certain outstanding equity securities of our subsidiaries. Please see &#147;Our Organizational Structure&#148; below for further information about the corporate restructuring and TR Capital&#146;s outstanding units.

Our Farming, Greenhouse and Water Operations 

Our business model integrates irrigated farming and water distribution in a manner developed specifically for semi-arid regions in the southwestern United States. By acquiring and converting irrigated farmland from feed crop production to fruit and vegetable production, we can afford to pay a higher price for water than a feed crop farmer. As a result, we elevate the price of water, thereby creating incentives for feed crop farmers to grow fruits and vegetables for us, when their farm is suitable, or to sell their farms to us. Additionally, the increased value of water creates incentives for farmers who have marginal farming operations to consider selling their water assets. By integrating our irrigated farmland with an expanding portfolio of water assets, we are positioning our company to benefit from the continued expansion of regional and global demand for food and water in the years to come. While a growing world population and rising incomes have been increasing demand for high quality food and fiber, the amount of arable land has been decreasing and water resources are fixed. By converting irrigated farmland from feed crop production to higher value fruit and vegetable production we elevate the economic productivity of the region within which we operate and make an additional segment of water available for other users.

Our current area of focus is the Arkansas River Basin, on the southern Front Range in Colorado. The elevations in the area fall from 14,000 feet above sea level at the eastern crest of the Continental Divide to 4,500 feet above sea level in Pueblo, Colorado. The Arkansas River is a tributary of the Mississippi River.

Since commencing operations in 2009, we have invested in acquiring and developing irrigated farmland and associated water rights and infrastructure. Our principal investments to date have been the following:

&#149; 

DFP : In 2012 we acquired Dionisio Farms &#38; Produce, Inc., or DFP ,for $3.4 million in cash and promissory notes. DFP, which has operated for more than 60 years, produces high-value fruits and vegetables as well as fodder crops. Through this acquisition, we obtained 146 acres of irrigable farmland, 146 shares of the Bessemer Ditch Irrigation Company, a senior water right holder on the main stem of the Arkansas River and 2 supplemental ground water wells. As part of the acquisition, we entered into leases for an additional 279 irrigable acres.

&#149; 

HCIC : From 2009 to 2013 we purchased 96% of the outstanding shares of Huerfano-Cucharas Irrigation Company, or HCIC, in a series of transactions for $ 24.2 million in cash, promissory notes and Common Stock. HCIC is a mutual ditch company formed in 1944 , and we use its water rights and facilities to supply some of our farmland with irrigation water.

&#149; 

Orlando : In 2011 we acquired Orlando Reservoir No. 2 Company, LLC, or Orlando, for $3.45 million in cash, promissory notes and Common Stock. Our ownership of Orlando increases the reliability of water supplies for our farmland in Huerfano and Pueblo Counties. We have undertaken a program to refurbish and restore Orlando&#146;s diversion structure, storage reservoirs and conveyance system. During the period from November 2011 to February 2012, we constructed new outlet works, and in 2012, we reconstructed the diversion structure, which takes water from the Huerfano River for storage in the Orlando reservoir and then conveyance to irrigate our nearby farmland. Additional renovation projects will be completed as necessary to provide reliable irrigation for our expanding farming operations.

&#149; 

Additional Farmland : From 2009 to 2011 we acquired 2,753 acres of farmland served by HCIC&#146;s ditch system for purchase prices totaling $1.4 million in cash and seller carry back financing. In 2012 we acquired 1,584 acres in Butte Valley for $509,000 in cash and seller carry back financing. In 2015, we returned 187 acres of Butte Valley land back to the holder of seller carry back financing in exchange of forgiving $187,000 of debt and associated accrued interest.

&#149; 

GrowCo : We formed GrowCo, Inc. , or GrowCo , in May 2014 for the purpose of constructing state-of-the-art computer controlled greenhouses for licensed marijuana growers throughout the United States. GrowCo is not a licensed marijuana grower or retailer. GrowCo does not &#147;touch the plant&#148; and only provides growing 

Table of Con tents 

infrastructure as a landlord for licensed marijuana grower tenants along with support and administrative services. 

Farming 

We focus our farming activities on acquiring high yield irrigated farmland and converting it from feed crop production into growing and marketing high-value fruits and vegetables for human consumption, which generate higher revenues and profits per acre. We put approximately 20% to 30% of our farming acreage into animal feed crops or preventative planting each year on a rotating basis to reconstitute the soil and to suppress disease and pest problems. In 2015, our average revenue per harvested acre from fruit and vegetable crops was $3,755, while our average revenue per acre from feed crops was $683. In 2014 our average revenue per acre from fruit and vegetable crops was $5,306, while our average revenue per acre from feed crops was $723. The decrease was largely due the crop mix in 2015 going into crops producing lower average revenue per acre.

(1) In 2015, approximately 93% (or $40,000) of our expected parsnips harvestwill ship in 2016.

(2) In 2015, sorghum was planted on 147.6 acres as weed prevention and then plowed under for fertilization. Therefore, sorghum was classified

as Preventive Planting/Insurance.

Our 2015 crop production consisted of cabbage, pumpkins, watermelons, squash, onions, parsnips and pinto beans raised for human consumption, as well as sorghum and corn as a feed crop. We intend to annually plant between 60% and 70% of our irrigated farmland in fruit and vegetable crops, leaving between 30% to 40% for feed crops, on a rotating basis. We expect to increase the variety of high-value crops we produce as we expand our farming operations. In early 2014, we installed a drip irrigation system on a test portion of our leased farmland to maximize yield and minimize water consumption. Our produce marketing operations package and ship produce for our farms and for a network of farmers who grow crops for us, and to date we have sold our fruits and vegetables principally to national accounts through our wholly owned subsidiary DFP.

Since 2009 we have sought to increase our irrigated farmland under management through strategic acquisitions and leasing in targeted areas of the Arkansas River Basin. Our intent is to purchase or lease irrigated farmland that is supported by relatively senior water rights with good soiland farm infrastructure that was currently producing feed crops and convert the farmland into fruit and vegetable production. We have also acquired irrigated farmland with good soil that has less reliable junior water rights and has not been farmed for some years but is capable of fruit and vegetable production when additional water rights can be acquired and moved to the farmland. Regardless of the historical use of irrigable land we buy or lease, we actively seek to transition the land from feed crop production to production of high-value fruits and vegetables. 

Table of Con tents 

As part of our strategy to develop and operate an expanding network of irrigated farmland, we selectively have purchased or leased land that is unsuitable for producing irrigated crops. In some instances, we have acquired land in order to gain control of water or other rights associated with the land. We also have strategically acquired grazing land as a medium to long-term real estate investment.

As of December 31, 2015, we managed 7,902 gross acres, of which we owned 7,350 acres and leased an additional 552acres. As of December 31, 2014, we held 8,157gross acres, of which we owned 7,538 acres and leased 619 acres. The following table provides a breakdown, by acres, of the uses and purposes of the land we managed as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:

When redeveloping farmland, we assemble sufficient water rights necessary to sustain reliable fruit and vegetable production by:

&#149; 

purchasing suites of water rights, including surface flow, augmentation and storage rights;

&#149; 

refurbishing historical ditch systems and reservoirs to restore and upgrade their efficiency; and

&#149; 

negotiating with governmental water authorities the agreements necessary to sustain production.

When redeveloping farmland, we seek to optimize product yield, water efficiencies and labor inputs by deploying state-of-the-art methods and equipment which includes:

&#149; 

deep-plowing fields to loosen soil beds;

&#149; 

laser-leveling planting areas to optimize water and nutrient absorption and minimize runoff;

&#149; 

installing advanced irrigation facilities to increase water efficiencies; and 

&#149; 

applying both organic and non-organic fertilizers and soil conditioners to enhance plant growth.

Redevelopment generally takes two to three years to transform fallow farmland into fruit and vegetable crop production.

Greenhouse Development, Leasing and Services 

Due to our strategic location of farmland and associated water rights, greenhouses operators have approached us to purchase some of our farmland and water rights. Since core to our business is the long-term ownership of farmland and water rights, we are not interested in one time sales. Rather, we want to use our excess farmland and associated water to create a long-term revenue stream. 

In Colorado, since the passing of recreational use of marijuana in 2012, the demand of marijuana has increased substantially. Presently over 90% of Colorado marijuana is grown in converted warehouses. Sophisticated growers understand that a warehouse production facility is not the most ideal for production. This has given rise to a strong demand for greenhouse space for marijuana production. Early estimates show a greenhouse can produce at least twice the amount of product at less than 50% of the cost compared to warehouse production. However, there are only a limited number of counties that allow for new greenhouse construction. New construction needs to be tied to water supply. Pueblo County, where we have the majority of our land and associated water rights, allows for new greenhouse construction for marijuana growing.

Not only is location and water a key to be successful in marijuana production, but also the knowledge of greenhouse operations and how to grow marijuana. In 2014, we selected a group knowledgeable in greenhouse operations and that have consulted with marijuana growers. In May, 2014, we formed GrowCo, Inc., or GrowCo, which issued 20,000,000 shares of its common stock to the Parent Company. On August 1, 2014 we announced that we were reserving 10,000,000 of the GrowCo shares to be distributed to holders of Common Stock as of four record dates (January 1, 2015; April 1, 2015; July 1, 2015 and October 1, 2015) after an effective registration statement is filed, which has not yet occured. On each record date, we will recording a pending distribution of 2,500,000 GrowCo common shares on a pro rata basis to holders of Common Stock.

Under GrowCo, a separate Colorado limited liability company will own each greenhouse project. On January 20, 2015, we announced that GrowCo Partners 1, LLC, or GCP1, completed a $4.4 million financing for the first greenhouse project, which consists of a 90,000 square foot greenhouse and 15,000 square foot processing and warehouse facility on 40 acres of land. GCP1&#146;s greenhouse was partially occupied in September with lease revenue beginning September 1, 2015. It is expected that a permanent certificate for full occupancy wil be granted in early April, 2016. 

Our second greenhouse project will also consist of a 90,000 square foot greenhouse and 15,000 square foot processing and warehouse facility on an additional 40 acres of land. Upon completion, this project will be operated, as a landlord, by GrowCo Partners 2, LLC, or GCP 2. GCP 2&#146;s greenhouse will share some facilities (e.g., boiler, water, generator) whereby costs might be shared with GCP 1. GCP 2&#146;s greenhouse structure was ordered in 2015. Construction on this greenhouse began in early January, 2016 with an expected completion by September 30, 2016. Recently, GCP 2 greenhouse was expanded from 90,000 square feet to 180,000 square feet with a 30,000 square foot warehouse.

During the third quarter of 2015, GrowCo completed a $4.0 million private placement of GrowCo debt, with proceeds to be used to partially fund the second greenhouse and provide working capital.

In December 2015, GrowCo completed a $[5.5] million private placement of equity interests of GCP Super Units, LLC, which will invest directly in various assets of GrowCo, with proceeds to be used to complete the construction of the first greenhouse, partially fund the second greenhouse and provide working capital. Our investment in GCP Super Units, LLC is reflected on our balance sheet as a non-controlling equity interest.

Water 

We own a portfolio of water rights in the Arkansas River Basin that we have obtained in connection with our purchases of irrigated farmland. Colorado allocates water based on the Prior Appropriation Doctrine, whereby water rights are unconnected to land ownership. The first person to use a quantity of water from a water source for a beneficial use has the right to continue to use that quantity of water for that purpose. Subsequent users can use the remaining water for their own beneficial purposes provided that they do not impinge on the rights of previous users.Water rights can be developed, managed, purchased and sold much like real property, and the seniority of water rights are a significant consideration when we acquire additional irrigated farmland. Water rights include the ability to divert stream flow , build a storage reservoir, pump ground water and create augmentation water supplies to offset depletions of water taken out of priority. Water rights can be developed, managed, purchased and sold much like real property, and the seniority of water rights are a significant consideration when we acquire additional irrigated farmland. 

We intend to develop a wholesale water distribution business through the development of our irrigated farming operations. By acquiring and converting irrigated farmland from feed crop production to fruit and vegetable production, we can afford to pay a higher price for water than a feed crop farmer. As a result, we elevate the price of water creating incentives for farmers growing feed crops to grow fruits and vegetables for us, when their farm is suitable, or to sell their farms to us. Additionally, the increased value of water creates incentives for farmers who have marginal farming operations to consider selling their water assets. 

Our principal water rights include the following:

&#149; 

As noted above, through our acquisition of DFP, and subsequent purchases we obtained 191.4 shares of the Bessemer Ditch Irrigation Company. The 191.4 shares are comprised of 155.4 shares owned, 36 shares subject to a conservation easement (can only be used on a specific land for farming) and 72 shares leased from the Pueblo Board of Water Works, which lease expires in 2030. Bessemer Ditch Irrigation Company is a mutual ditch company that operates an irrigation canal on the main stem of the Arkansas River. It has a headgate in the Pueblo Dam and delivers irrigation water. We own and operate various senior water rights in the Arkansas River Basin, which we use or plan to use to irrigate our farmland. This diversified portfolio is made up of a combination of direct flow rights and storage rights.

&#149; 

As noted above, we acquired control of HCIC in order to use its water rights and facilities to supply some of our farmland with irrigation water. The HCIC farmland became fallow in the mid-twentieth century when coal mines in Huerfano County, Colorado , were shut down. The coal mines had continuously pumped water from the Vermejo/Trinidad Formation, which contained a renewable underground aquifer that is fed by Sangre de Cristo Mountains snowmelt. The U.S. Geological Service estimates that the Vermejo/Trinidad Formation contains an estimated 30 million acre-feet of relatively untapped, clean and renewable water. HCIC owns the Cucharas and Huerfano Valley Reservoirs and two ditch systems located in Pueblo County, Colorado. The HCIC ditch systems have the right to distribute water over approximately 40,000 acres in Pueblo County, Colorado.

&#149; 

The Orlando water rights include the senior-most direct flow water right on the Huerfano River, or #1 priority, along with the #9 priority and miscellaneous junior water rights. The seniority of those water rights allowed the production of crops during the most recent drought. The Orlando assets also include the Orlando reservoir, which is situated on the Huerfano branch of the Huerfano River and has a storage capacity of 3,100 acre-feet.

An acre-foot of water is the amount of water required to cover one acre to a depth of one foot. An acre-foot of water contains 325,851 gallons, generally considered enough water to supply two average households for a year. Annual irrigation in Southeastern Colorado, depending on the crops, consumes approximately three to six acre-feet of water per acre of crop.

To date our water operations have focused principally on acquiring and developing water rights to support our farming efforts, including the farming operations of the network of farmers who grow crops for us, and we have acquired our portfolio of water rights through the acquisition of farming assets. By capturing water in reservoirs and releasing it later for irrigation purposes, we are able to retime the delivery of water throughout the irrigation season and ameliorate some of the inconsistencies of seasonal and annual water availability for the farmland we manage. 

Table of Con tents 

In 2009, we began acquiring and developing irrigated farmland and associated water rights and infrastructure. As of December 31, 2015, we owned 7,350 gross acres. Gross acres owned decreased slightly from 7,538gross acres at December 31, 2014. We will seek long term to expand our holdings by strategically acquiring or leasing irrigable farmland in the Arkansas River Basin. We intend to develop and bring into production more of our currently held gross acres as we acquire additional water rights. We also expect to increase the variety of crops we produce as we continue to expand our farming operations through acreage we manage and through our network of growers.

To date, our water operations have focused principally on acquiring and developing water rights to support our farming efforts, including the farming operations of the network of farmers who grow crops for us. We intend to expand our portfolio of water rights in the future to not only support our expanding farm operations, but also to lease and sell water to other users in the Arkansas River Basin. 

Augmentation Rights 

Tributary ground water is any underground water that is hydraulically connected to a stream system and that influences the rate or direction of flow in that stream system. Any new ground water diversions that are tributary to an over-appropriated stream system require augmentation to offset out-of-priority depletions. In 2013 many well water users on the Arkansas River and its tributaries were unable to use their wells, as drought conditions made augmentation water unavailable. In response, an augmentation provider requested that we assist in building a more efficient and plentiful augmentation supply. We intend to assist with an augmentation supply, but due to capital requirements, we do not plan to begin augmentation supply development in the near future. The years ended December 31, 2015and 2014 were considered wetter years, so the demand for augmentation supply was reduced.

We control 263.4 of the outstanding 17,980 shares of Bessemer Irrigation Company. We own 155.4 of those shares without restriction, own an additional 36 shares subject to a conservation easement and lease 72 shares from Pueblo Board of Water Works. The 191.4 shares we own represent 1.06% of the outstanding shares of Bessemer Irrigation Company and therefore provide us with 1.06% of consumptive use. The 62,029 acre-feet is a 100-year average. The 10-year average for consumptive use is 66,566 acre-feet, and the 5-year average is 57,362 acre-feet.

This is a conditional right while the engineering and construction of structures are completed to perfect a water right, in this case to physically store the water. The conditional right establishes a seniority date but allows time for completion of the project. Conditional rights are reviewed every six years by the water court to confirm that progress is being made on the effort to perfect the right. When a conditional water right is perfected, which can be done incrementally in the case of storage, the water right becomes absolute.

As part of our comprehensive water and farming system, we utilize storage reservoirs and ditches. Reservoirs allow water owners to store their water and plan the water&#146;s distribution throughout the growing season. We currently own reservoirs associated with HCIC and Orlando, and we plan to develop additional reservoirs and augmentation ponds, also known as recharge ponds, in strategic locations in the Arkansas River watershed. The development of storage reservoirs in the area will allow us to offer storage to other water users in the area. Through water exchanges and other water-related transactions, the reservoirs can potentially increase and strengthen our existing water rights. 

All of our reservoirs are used for irrigation in a similar manner to other reservoirs in the region, with the exception of Pueblo Reservoir, which was also constructed for flood control. Direct flow rights generally are senior to most storage rights but typically do not divert early in the spring when storage rights fill. The Arkansas River below Pueblo Reservoir operates a Winter Storage Program that re-allocates winter direct flow rights to storage in reservoirs from November 15 to March 15 each year. 

Because our water rights and operating structures are located at succeeding elevations in the watershed, the system moves water supplies from point of diversion, through storage, to place of use primarily by means of gravity, making our more economical to operate than systems requiring energy to pump water for beneficial use.

In order to use these rights and structures most efficiently, we have planned and begun to implement a program of renovation and integration. For example, we began construction of new outlet works for the 1905 Orlando Reservoir in November 2011. The work was completed and successfully tested in February 2012, approximately a year after we acquired Orlando. Also in February 2012, we commenced reconstruction of the diversion structure, which takes water from the Huerfano River for storage in the Orlando reservoir, and to irrigate our nearby farmland. Additional water facility renovation projects are planned on a phased basis as necessary to provide reliable irrigation for our expanding farming operations. Currently, the renovation and integration activity by us has been put on hold as we concentrate our efforts and resources expanding our greenhouse development, leasing and services activities.

We currently have the operable right to store 15,000 acre-feet of water within the Huerfano and Cucharas Rivers watershed in three separate reservoirs, subject to repair, or removal and rebuilding, limitations. When our reservoirs on the Huerfano and Cucharas Rivers have been fully restored, we will have the operable capacity and legal right to 

Table of Con tents 

store in excess of 70,000 acre-feet of water. Similarly, based on our portfolio of water rights, we have the right to divert from the natural flows of the two rivers in excess of 90 cubic feet per second. Seasonal variability in the natural flow of the rivers, as well as the priorities of other water users in the system, limits our ability to divert the decreed amounts of water on a continuous basis. Our current water rights produce a long-term average annual diversion of 15,000 acre-feet of water, which provides 10,000 acre-feet of consumptive use at the plant. 

The 15,000 acre-feet average is based on a record period of more than 50 years and also relies on historic studies of these rights by a variety of engineers at various times. It is common practice within the water industry in Colorado to use long periods of time to create reliable averages of water flow. We believe that using averages relating to only recent years can be misleading because an average could be skewed if only one of those years was particularly dry or wet. For example, in four out of the last ten years, there has been an extreme drought in our area of operations. Due to this drought condition, our flow averages for the most recent ten, five and three years are 8,200 acre-feet, 10,500 acre-feet and 10,400 acre-feet, respectfully. A similar request for the same averages for the decade beginning in 1980 would be result in averages of 5,900 acre-feet, 18,500 acre-feet and 17,200 acre-feet.

&#147;Consumptive use&#148; is the term for the portion of a water diversion right that is actually consumed by its beneficial use. Where the beneficial use is agricultural irrigation, consumptive use represents the amount of water consumed by the irrigated crop or evaporated on the farm. After deducting consumptive use from the amount of water diverted and applied to irrigation, the remainder is described as &#147;return flow&#148; to the system. Such return flows are generally subject to appropriation downstream. Only the consumptive use portion of a given water right is subject to transfer (that is, a change in the point of diversion, place of use, or purpose of use). Therefore, water rights are often assigned monetary value based on the consumptive use portion. Although consumptive use varies by crop, rainfall, temperature and other factors, in southeastern Colorado, crops generally consume about two acre-feet of applied water for each acre planted, depending on the crops planted. In order to provide that amount of consumptive use water, an irrigator must generally apply three acre-feet of water (allowing for predictable return flow equal to about one-third of the applied water). We measure our water rights both in terms of the amount of the diversion or storage right, as the case may be, but also in terms of the historic consumptive use.

Our Organizational Structure 

Since commencing operations as a farming and water company in 2009, we have built an organizational structure that enabled us to raise capital for specific projects completed by our direct and indirect subsidiaries. 

In January 2014, the board of directors approved a plan to reorganize our subsidiaries in a more integrated manner based on functional operations. We formed TR Capital, which issued all of its common units to the Parent Company. In a series of transactions from January to September 2014, TR Capital entered into Membership Interest Purchase Agreements pursuant to which it issued and sold a total of 30,158,815 preferred units to investors in exchange for consideration comprised of $6.0 million in cash and $18.9 million of outstanding equity and equity-related securities of our subsidiaries other than HCIC Holdings, LLC and Huerfano-Cucharas Irrigation Company. 

The TR Capital Limited Liability Company Agreement dated as of January 31, 2014 provides that holders of preferred units generally will be entitled to receive distributions each fiscal year in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) 12% of the preferred unit holders&#146; aggregate capital contributions and (b) TR Capital&#146;s Adjusted Gross Margin (as defined) for such fiscal year . Regardless of TR Capital&#146;s operating results, however, preferred unit holders are entitled to a minimum distribution for each full fiscal year equal to 8% of their aggregate capital contributions, payable in equal quarterly installments. If TR Capital&#146;s Adjusted Gross Margin for a fiscal year is less than 12% of the preferred unit holders&#146; aggregate capital contributions, the shortfall will not be payable in any subsequent fiscal year. Distributions for fiscal year 2014 for each preferred unit were prorated for the portion of the year that the preferred unit was outstanding. 

Pursuant to an Exchange Agreement dated as of January 31, 2014 entered into with TR Capital and the Parent Company, any holder may surrender a TR Capital preferred unit to the Parent Company at any time for consideration consisting of (a) accrued but unpaid preferred distributions on the preferred unit through the exchange date, (b) one share of Common Stock and (c) a warrant to purchase an additional one-half share of Common Stock at a price of $2.10 per share. TR Capital may require (with limited exceptions) each of its outstanding preferred units to be surrendered to the Parent Company in exchange for such consideration at any time after January 31, 2017 , at which ( 1) for a period of 20 trading days, at least 250,000 shares of Common Stock have been traded on a national 

Table of Con tents 

securities exchange for a closing price of at least $3.00 and (b) a registration statement filed by us with the SEC is effective with respect to the shares of Common Stock, including shares purchasable pursuant to warrants, issuable upon such exchanges. Each warrant issued upon any such exchange generally will be exercisable at any time on or before January 31, 2019, subject to our right to redeem the warrant at any time after January 31, 2017 , at which (A) for a period of 20 trading days, at least 250,000 shares of Common Stock have been traded on a national securities exchange for a closing price of at least $3.00 and (B) a registration statement has been filed and is effective with respect to the shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such warrant. Under the Exchange Agreement, the Parent Company also granted holders of preferred units one-time demand registration rights under which the Parent Company may be required to file a registration statement covering shares of Common Stock (including shares subject to warrants) issued or issuable upon exchanges of TR Capital preferred units. As of March 20, 2016, the Parent Company could be required under the Parent Company to issue and deliver to holders of outstanding TR Capital preferred units, upon exchange, up to 30,013,834 shares of Common Stock together with warrants to purchase up to an additional 15,095,957 shares of Common Stock. If the Parent Company receives any TR Capital pursuant to exchanges under the Exchange Agreement, it would be entitled to receive distributions on those preferred units pro rata with other holders of preferred units.

Following the completion of those transactions in September 2014, TR Capital and the Parent Company&#146;s other direct and indirect subsidiaries (excluding HCIC Holdings, LLC and HCIC) entered into a series of related transactions as the result of which control and operation of those other subsidiaries and their businesses transferred to TR Capital, which is the operational division of Two Rivers. The following chart shows our corporate organization as of March 20, 2016:

Revenue 

Produce 

The produce industry, like many other industries, is built on relationships that take place over time and involve a great deal of trust. Our produce relationships were built exactly this way; DFP marketing relationships go back 20 years. Contracts are negotiated on a yearly basis before planting begins. At the beginning of the year, we reach out to our vendors to see what their needs are going to be for that year and plant to their needs. Once it is planted, the contract has been finalized with the agreed upon amount and price. About 20% of the produce we grow does not have a contract, and will be sold to other vendors who contact us for product. 

We also have a network of growers that grow produce for us. Once our produce contracts are finalized, and our planting schedule for the year is complete, we reach out to our growers to ask them to plant the remaining crops we need. As people in the area become aware of our operation, they are signing up to grow for us. 

Leasing 

GrowCo&#146;s subsidiary GrowCo Parnters 1, LLC leases a greenhouse and warehouse to Suncanna, LLC pursuant to a lease agreement dated April 1, 2015. The lease agreement is classified as an operating lease because it does not meet any of the four criteria listed in subsection 25-1 of ASC 840-10-25, &#147;Lease Classification Criteria&#148;. 

On February 25, 2016, RH Group, LLC, a newly formed entity of which the Chief Executive Officer of Two Rivers and GrowCo, John McKowen, holds a 60% membership interest, entered into a definitive agreement to purchase all of the equity interests of Suncanna from the previous owner. The closing of the proposed acquisition remains subject to certain regulatory filings and hearings in the State of Colorado regarding the transfer of rights to grow marijuana that would be deemed to result from the change in Suncanna&#146;s ownership. Because of Mr. McKowen's majority ownership and control of a potential acquirer of Suncanna, we determined, as of February 25, 2016, that during and after fiscal year 2015 Suncanna should be regarded as a related party, and transactions with Suncanna should be classified as related party transactions, for financial statement reporting purposes.

As of December 31, 2015, we had advanced $203,000 to our related party tenant, Suncanna, to assist with its working capital. ASC 605-45-45, &#147;Revenue Recognition, Prinicipal Agent Considerations&#148;, provides eight indicators that may support reporting gross revenue. While GrowCo does not have any rights to Suncanna&#146;s cannabis inventory, we determined that GrowCo is the primary obligor of Suncanna&#146;s working capital commitments, performs part of the service on behalf of Suncanna, is involved in the determination of services to Suncanna, and has credit risk. Therefore, the $203,000 advance is recognized as an addition to leasing revenue&#151;related party and is shown as a direct cost of leasing revenue.

Competition 

Produce 

The rights to use water in Colorado have been fully appropriated to beneficial uses (such as agriculture irrigation and municipal and industrial applications) under court decrees and state regulation according to the prevailing Prior Appropriation Doctrine in which more senior (older) water rights take precedence in times of shortage over junior (newer) water rights. Notwithstanding significant conservation, growth in Colorado with related incremental demands for water has made the rights to divert, convey, store and use water relatively scarce and valuable. There is significant competition for the acquisition and beneficial use of historic water rights. Many competitors for the acquisition of such rights have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do and, consequently, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in assembling, developing and deploying water assets required to support our businesses. Competitors&#146; resources could overwhelm our efforts and cause adverse consequences to our operational performance. To mitigate such competitive risks, we concentrate our efforts in the Huerfano and Cucharas Rivers watershed where our local knowledge and control of a portfolio of water rights, storage facilities, distribution canals and productive farmland creates a somewhat protected geographic niche. To further mitigate competitive risk, we strive to actively engage with both the farming and the water communities in southeastern Colorado to explore strategies for cooperatively addressing challenges and 

Table of Con tents 

opportunities faced by those communities&#151;particularly to address the 130,000 acre-foot shortfall in water supplies on the Front Range, without taking valuable farmland out of production.

We also acquire farmland through outright purchase with the intent to hold and manage, through purchase with the intent to resell to investors with our company managing farm production, and from leases, preferably long term. There is growing competition for acquisition of farmland. Many purchasers of farmland have greater financial resources than we do. Our advantage is our built-in infrastructure for the processing, shipping and marketing of produce.

Leasing 

There a significant number of providers of facilities to lease to cannabis growers. Some are better capitalized than our Company. A significant portion of the facilities offered for lease are enclosed, warehouse space. Through our development of state-of-the-art greenhouses, we believe that we offer a competitive advantage to lessees of warehouse space in terms of increased production (estimated to be three times the growth) and a significantly reduced cost of production (estimated at one-third the cost). Therefore, our main competition are other greenhouse structures offered to lease to cannabis growers. We are aware of only one other similar size greenhouse in the front range of Colorado. This facility is owned by the same owners of medical and retail outlets. Therefore, they are only growing product for their consumption. It is much like a single-tenant office building. There are numerous other small greenhouses and others that are planned.

Regulation 

Farming 

We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws that govern various aspects of our business, including: laws regulating the cultivation, processing, handling, storage, transport and sale of our products, laws restricting the use and ownership of land, including laws regulating the acquisition or leasing of rural properties by certain entities and individuals, and rules and regulations governing a variety of environmental, health and safety matters. In addition, we are subject to other laws and government policies governing or affecting the food and agriculture industries, including legal requirements for food and feed safety.

To continue to operate and expand our operations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, licenses and approvals from governmental agencies. Our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by governmental agencies. 

From time to time, agricultural production shortfalls in certain regions and growing demand for agricultural commodities for feed, food and fuel use have caused prices for soybeans, vegetable oils, sugar, corn and wheat to rise. High commodity prices and regional crop shortfalls have led, and in the future may lead, governments to impose price controls, tariffs, export restrictions and other measures designed to assure adequate domestic supplies or mitigate price increases in their domestic markets, as well as to increase the scrutiny of competitive conditions in their markets. 

Our business could be adversely affected in the future by national regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has adopted regulations requiring the owners of certain facilities to measure and report their greenhouse gas emissions, and has initiated a process to regulate these emissions under the Clean Air Act. We cannot at this time assess or estimate the potential impact of any future greenhouse gas emission legislation or regulations on our business. Potential consequences could, however, include increases in our costs of energy, transportation and raw materials and requirements for additional investments in our facilities and equipment, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash position.

Water 

Background 

The right to water in Colorado is a right that can be developed, managed, purchased or sold much like real property subject to appropriate regulation. Water rights are judicially decreed and, under Colorado&#146;s application of the Prior Appropriation Doctrine (&#147;first in time, first in right&#148;), senior water right holders are entitled to the beneficial use of 

Table of Con tents 

water prior to junior holders. Consequently senior water rights are more consistent, reliable and valuable than junior rights, which may be interrupted, or &#147;called out&#148; in the parlance of Colorado water administration. 

Along the Front Range of Colorado, water is a scarce and valuable resource. Natural precipitation varies widely throughout the year and from one year to another. Rivers, which fill, and sometimes flood, with the spring melt from the mountain snowpack, may be refreshed only with the occasional thunderstorm in the heat of the summer growing season. Annual precipitation also varies between surplus and drought. Additionally, the large majority of Colorado&#146;s population resides on the Front Range (east of the Continental Divide) while the large majority of the state&#146;s precipitation falls on the Western Slope (west of the Divide). Over time, many communities, farms and enterprises developed trans-mountain diversions to bring more water to the Front Range. Precipitation on the Front Range, and water diverted from the Western Slope, drain to the Mississippi River through the South Platte and Arkansas Rivers. Water on the Western Slope drains through the Colorado River. All of the state&#146;s rivers are administered pursuant to interstate compacts with neighboring states. As a result of the variability of Colorado&#146;s hydrology, its arrangements for diversions, storage and beneficial use, and its obligations to downstream states, Colorado has developed an integrated and complex water rights administration system. 

In Colorado and the Western United States, the right to use water is based on the Prior Appropriation Doctrine, which is often referred to as &#147;first in time, first in right.&#148; Under this doctrine, water use is allocated to satisfy the oldest (&#147;most senior&#148;) water right before water is allocated to the next water right in historic chronology (a &#147;junior water right&#148; in comparison to a water right perfected earlier). Moreover, in Colorado, water rights and their relative priorities are protected by judicial decrees and are administered by the Office of the State Engineer, or the State Engineer, within the Colorado Department of Water Resources. The ability to consistently irrigate farmland, and thus avoid the inconsistencies of rainfall, is therefore tied to the relative seniority of historic water rights. Two Rivers is focused on developing irrigated farmland and maximizing beneficial use of the water rights associated with that farmland.

To manage water uses according to the Prior Appropriation Doctrine, Colorado maintains both judicial oversight through regional water courts and administrative oversight through the State Engineer. Water rights claims are filed in the court, adjudicated as necessary to resolve any adverse claims, and then decreed though an enforceable judgment. The State Engineer is charged with administering the accorded priorities among the various water rights in each of the state&#146;s river systems. 

Colorado water law further recognizes two distinct but related prior appropriative rights: direct diversion rights and storage rights. Direct diversion rights permit a user in priority to divert water directly from the river for immediate beneficial use (such as irrigation); storage rights permit a user in priority to divert water from the river and impound the water in a reservoir to re-time the water for later beneficial use. Thus, in Colorado, a direct diversion right must be conveyed to an immediate use; it cannot be stored without a storage right. As a result, both types of appropriative rights are often paired, when possible, so that in priority diversion rights can be re-timed through the exercise of a companion storage right to address seasonal and year-to-year variability in natural supplies. The older the appropriation date of any water right, the more reliable is its yield; similarly, the more effectively a senior diversion right is paired with a senior storage right, the more reliable each becomes. 

Administration of Water Rights 

In addition to the intra-state administration of water flowing in its rivers, Colorado also has inter-state water administration responsibilities because each of its major rivers (the Colorado, the North Platte and the Arkansas) is governed as well by interstate compacts with downstream states. These compacts are subject to judicial review, interpretation and enforcement under the original jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court to resolve disputes among the states. In 1948, Colorado and Kansas reached an agreement that apportioned the water of the Arkansas River; Colorado was apportioned 60% of the water while Kansas is apportioned 40% of the River&#146;s flow. In order to comply with Colorado&#146;s obligations under the Arkansas River Compact, therefore, water rights on the Arkansas and its tributaries (including the Huerfano and Cucharas Rivers) are administered to assure the compact-required water flows at the Colorado-Kansas state line. When necessary, Colorado&#146;s in-state uses are curtailed, in reverse order of priority, to assure compliance with the compact.

The interstate compacts (beginning with the Colorado River Compact of 1922) increased Colorado&#146;s need to husband its apportioned water to meet the needs of its growing population along the Front Range. Trans-basin 

Table of Con tents 

diversions (primarily tunnels and canals) were developed, under the Prior Appropriation Doctrine, to divert water from one watershed for conveyance to and use in another. Mainly, water from the Colorado River Basin, west of the Continental Divide, was diverted east to meet the water needs along the earlier developing Front Range by so-called &#147;conservancy districts&#148;. These projects began in the 1930&#146;s and, although many have been in operation for decades, some remain incomplete. Increasingly, further trans-basin diversions are limited not only by competing appropriative water rights in the basins of origin but also by increasingly stringent environmental restrictions. 

Stymied in their attempts to import additional surface water from distant watersheds, some municipalities and water providers began to rely on inherently unsustainable ground water &#147;mining&#148; (depleting aquifers for current consumption at a rate in excess of the rate at which natural recharge occurs). After decades of such ground water mining, many of the aquifers on the Front Range have been severely depleted. Some municipalities also purchased farms with water diversion rights and then ceased irrigating the farmland, transferring the water to their urban uses. Because neither the practice of ground water mining nor the practice of &#147;buying up and drying up&#148; farmland is sustainable, Colorado law has placed limits and regulations on both practices.

Recognizing the need for additional water sources along the Front Range, the Colorado Water Conservation Board published its 2050 Municipal and Industrial Gap Analysis in 2011 . This report estimates that the Arkansas and South Platte Basins (essentially the Front Range) will have a combined average annual supply shortage of 130,000 acre-feet of water by 2050. The difficulty and expense of incremental trans-mountain diversions coupled with the unsustainability of ground water mining and agricultural-to-urban transfers&#151;as documented by the Colorado Water Conservation Board&#151;motivates Front Range water purveyors to address the projected gap and to identify and develop inherently scarce renewable sources of water. 

As early as 2005, the Colorado General Assembly created basin roundtables to convene regional water purveyors to address the looming municipal supply gap. The roundtables were charged to identify &#147;projects and methods to meet the consumptive and non-consumptive needs of the basin.&#148; (Colorado House Bill 05-1177). The potential solutions include Identified Plans and Process or IPPs, Conservation, New Supply Development , and Alternatives to Agricultural Transfers.

The Arkansas River Basin Roundtable has only a few IPPs to meet the water supply gap identified in its basin. The most significant of the Arkansas Basin IPPs is the Southern Delivery System, an $800 million, 62-mile water supply pipeline and associated pumping plants currently under construction by a consortium of four regional water purveyors including Colorado Springs. These purveyors will use a portion of the capacity in the Southern Delivery System to transport water made available to each of them under their respective contracts with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. The Southern Delivery System connects the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation&#146;s Pueblo Reservoir on the Arkansas River, the point of delivery under the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation contracts, with the purveyors&#146; service areas 

In order to address a portion of the identified gap between forecast supply and demand within the Arkansas Basin and to provide a substitute source of water for Front Range communities that are too reliant on depleted ground water aquifers, the design and planning for the Southern Delivery System anticipate that other water purveyors will subscribe for pipeline capacity to transport renewable water supplies to their service areas. 

Leasing and Providing Services to Cannabis Growers 

As of March 20, 2016, 23 states and the District of Columbia allowed their residents to use medical marijuana and voters in the States of Colorado and Washington had approved and implemented regulations to legalize cannabis for adult use.

These state laws are in conflict with the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which classifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance and makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the federal government has the right to regulate and criminalize marijuana, even for medical purposes, and thus federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana preempts state laws that legalize its use. The Obama administration has made numerous statements indicating that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. However, the Obama administration could change its policy regarding 

Table of Con tents 

the low-priority enforcement of federal laws and the succeeding administration could decide to enforce the federal laws more stringently. 

The development of the GrowCo business model of constructing and leasing greenhouse space to licensed marijuana growers in states where growing marijuana is legal is dependent on Colorado marijuana laws remaining in force and federal laws not being enforced. If Colorado marijuana laws were not to remain in force or if federal marijuana laws were to be enforced, then GrowCo greenhouses could be used to grow organic fruits and vegetables, in which case we estimate the cash flow to GrowCo would decrease by approximately 75% but would still be positive.

Employees 

At March 20, 2016, we had 12full-time and 1 part time employee, of whom 3.5 were employed at our Denver headquarters, 6 were employed in our farming and water operations, and 3 were employed in our GrowCo subsidiary. We also use approximately 30 seasonalmigrate farm workers under the United Stated Department of Agriculture H2A program. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
