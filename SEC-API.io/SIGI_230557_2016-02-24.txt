Overview 

&#160; 

Selective Insurance Group, Inc. (referred to as the &#8220;Parent&#8221;) is a New Jersey holding company that was incorporated in 1977. Our main office is located in Branchville, New Jersey and the Parent&#8217;s common stock is publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol &#8220;SIGI.&#8221; The Parent has ten insurance subsidiaries, nine of which are licensed by various state departments of insurance to write specific lines of property and casualty insurance business in the standard market. The remaining subsidiary is authorized by various state insurance departments to write property and casualty insurance in the excess and surplus lines ("E&#38;S Lines") market. Our ten insurance subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the &#8220;Insurance Subsidiaries.&#8221; The Parent and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as "we," &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; in this document. 

In 2015, we were ranked as the 42 nd &#32;largest property and casualty group in the United States based on 2014 net premiums written (&#8220;NPW&#8221;) in A.M. Best Company&#8217;s (&#8220;A.M. Best&#8221;) annual list of &#8220;Top 200 U.S. Property/Casualty Writers.&#8221;

We have provided a glossary of terms as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K, which defines certain industry-specific and other terms that are used in this Form 10-K. 

Segments 

We classify our business into four reportable segments: 

&#8226; 

Standard Commercial Lines - comprised of insurance products and services provided in the standard marketplace to our commercial customers, who are typically businesses, non-profit organizations, and local government agencies. This business represents 77% of our total insurance segments&#8217; NPW. 

&#8226; 

Standard Personal Lines - comprised of insurance products and services provided primarily to individuals acquiring coverage in the standard marketplace. This business represents 14% of our total insurance segments&#8217; NPW and includes flood insurance coverage that we write through the National Flood Insurance Program (&#8220;NFIP&#8221;). 

&#8226; 

E&#38;S Lines - comprised of insurance products and services provided to customers who have not obtained coverage in the standard marketplace. We currently only write commercial lines E&#38;S coverages and this business represents 9% of our total insurance segments&#8217; NPW. 

&#8226; 

Investments - invests the premiums collected by our insurance segments, as well as amounts generated through our capital management strategies, which may include the issuance of debt and equity securities. 

We derive substantially all of our income in three ways: 

&#8226; 

Underwriting income from our insurance segments . Underwriting income is comprised of revenues, which are the premiums earned on our insurance products and services, less expenses. Gross premiums are direct premium written (&#8220;DPW&#8221;) plus premiums assumed from other insurers. Gross premiums less premium ceded to reinsurers, is NPW. NPW is recognized as revenue ratably over a policy&#8217;s term as net premiums earned (&#8220;NPE&#8221;). Expenses related to our insurance segments fall into three main categories: (i) losses associated with claims and various loss expenses incurred for adjusting claims (referred to as &#8220;loss and loss expenses&#8221;); (ii) expenses related to insurance policy issuance, such as commissions to our distribution partners, premium taxes, and other expenses incurred in issuing and maintaining policies, including employee compensation and benefits (referred to as &#8220;underwriting expenses&#8221;); and (iii) policyholder dividends. 

&#8226; 

Net investment income from the investment segment . We generate income from investing insurance premiums and amounts generated through our capital management strategies. Net investment income consists primarily of interest earned on fixed income investments, dividends earned on equity securities, and other income primarily generated from our alternative investment portfolio. 

&#8226; 

Net realized gains and losses on investment securities from the investments segment . Realized gains and losses from the investment portfolios of the Insurance Subsidiaries and the Parent are typically the result of sales, calls, and redemptions. They also include write downs from other-than-temporary impairments (&#8220;OTTI&#8221;). 

Our income is partially offset by: (i) expenses at the Parent that include general corporate expenses, as well as interest on our debt obligations; and (ii) federal income taxes. 

We use the combined ratio as the key measure in assessing the performance of our insurance segments. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), the combined ratio is calculated by adding: (i) the loss and loss expense ratio, which is the ratio of incurred loss and loss expense to NPE; (ii) the expense ratio, which is the ratio of underwriting expenses to NPE; and (iii) the dividend ratio, which is the ratio of policyholder dividends to NPE. Statutory accounting principles ("SAP") provides a calculation of the combined ratio that differs from GAAP in that the statutory expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses to NPW, not NPE. A combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit and a combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss. The combined ratio does not reflect investment income, federal income taxes, or Parent company income or expense. 

We use after-tax investment income and net realized gains or losses as the key measure in assessing the performance of our investments segment. Our investment philosophy includes setting certain risk and return objectives for the fixed income, equity, and other investment portfolios. We generally review our performance by comparing our returns for each of these components of our portfolio to a weighted-average benchmark of comparable indices. 

Our operations are heavily regulated by the state insurance regulators in the states in which our Insurance Subsidiaries are organized and licensed or authorized to do business. In these states, the Insurance Subsidiaries are required to file financial statements prepared in accordance with SAP, which are promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (&#8220;NAIC&#8221;) and adopted by the various states. Because of these state insurance regulatory requirements, we use SAP to manage our insurance operations. The purpose of these state insurance regulations is to protect policyholders, so SAP focuses on solvency and liquidation value unlike GAAP, which focuses on shareholder returns as a going concern. Consequently, significant differences exist between SAP and GAAP as discussed below: 

&#8226; 

With regard to the underwriting expense ratio : As noted above, NPE is the denominator for GAAP; whereas NPW is the denominator for SAP. 

&#8226; 

With regard to income or expense recognition : 

&#8226; 

Underwriting expenses that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of insurance policies are deferred and amortized to expense over the life of an insurance policy under GAAP; whereas they are recognized when incurred under SAP. 

&#8226; 

Deferred taxes are recognized as either a deferred tax expense or a deferred tax benefit in income under GAAP; whereas they are recorded directly to surplus under SAP. 

&#8226; 

Changes in the value of our alternative investments, which are part of our other investment portfolio on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are recognized in income under GAAP; whereas they are recorded directly to surplus under SAP and only recognized in income when cash is received. 

&#8226; 

With regard to loss and loss expense reserves : 

&#8226; 

Under GAAP, reinsurance recoverables, net of a provision for uncollectible reinsurance, are presented as an asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, whereas under SAP, this amount is netted within the liability for loss and loss expense reserves. 

&#8226; 

Under GAAP, for those structured settlements for which we did not obtain a release, a deposit asset and the related loss reserve are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, whereas under SAP, the structured settlement transaction is recorded as a paid loss. 

The following table reconciles losses and loss expense reserves under SAP and GAAP at December 31 as follows:

With regard to equity under GAAP and statutory surplus under SAP : 

&#8226; 

The timing difference in income due to the GAAP/SAP differences in expense recognition creates a difference between GAAP equity and SAP statutory surplus. 

&#8226; 

Regarding unrealized gains and losses on fixed income securities: 

&#8226; 

Under GAAP, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale (&#8220;AFS&#8221;) fixed income securities are recognized in equity; but they are not recognized in equity on purchased held-to-maturity (&#8220;HTM&#8221;) securities. Unrealized gains and losses on HTM securities transferred from an AFS designation are amortized from equity as a yield adjustment. 

&#8226; 

Under SAP, unrealized gains and losses on fixed income securities assigned certain NAIC Securities Valuation Office ratings (specifically designations of one or two, which generally equate to investment grade bonds) are not recognized in statutory surplus. However, unrealized losses on fixed income securities that have a designation of three or higher are recognized in statutory surplus. 

&#8226; 

Certain assets are designated under insurance regulations as &#8220;non-admitted,&#8221; including, but not limited to, certain deferred tax assets, overdue premium receivables, furniture and equipment, and prepaid expenses. These assets are excluded from statutory surplus under SAP, but are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of applicable allowances under GAAP. 

&#8226; 

Regarding the recognition of the liability for our defined benefit plans, under both GAAP and SAP, the liability is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the projected benefit obligation over the fair value of the plan assets. However, changes in this balance not otherwise recognized in income are recognized in equity as a component of other comprehensive income (&#8220;OCI&#8221;) under GAAP and in statutory surplus under SAP.

For revenue and profitability measures for each of our three insurance segments, see Note 11. "Segment Information" in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." of this Form 10-K. We do not allocate assets to individual segments. In addition, for analysis of our insurance segments' results, see "Results of Operations and Related Information by Segment" in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis &#32; of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." of this Form 10-K. 

Insurance Segments 

Overview 

&#160; 

We derive all of our insurance operations revenue from selling insurance products and services to businesses and individuals for premium. The majority of our sales are annual insurance policies. Our most significant cost associated with the sale of insurance policies is our loss and loss expenses. 

To that end, we establish loss and loss expense reserves that are estimates of the amounts that we will need to pay in the future for claims and related expenses for insured losses that have already occurred. Estimating reserves as of any given date involves a considerable degree of judgment and is inherently uncertain. We regularly review our reserving techniques and our overall amount of reserves. For disclosures concerning our unpaid loss and loss expenses, as well as a full discussion regarding our loss reserving process, see "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." of this Form 10-K. Additionally, for an analysis of changes in our loss reserves over the most recent three-year period, see Note 9. "Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses" in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." of this Form 10-K. 

As part of our risk management efforts associated with the sale of our products and services, we use reinsurance to protect our capital resources and insure us against losses on the risks that we underwrite. We use two main reinsurance vehicles: (i) a reinsurance pooling agreement among our Insurance Subsidiaries in which each company agrees to share in premiums and losses based on certain specified percentages; and (ii) reinsurance contracts and arrangements with third parties that cover various policies that we issue to our customers. For information regarding reinsurance treaties and agreements, see "Reinsurance" in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." of this Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Insurance Segments Products and Services 

The types of insurance we sell in our insurance segments fall into three broad categories: 

&#8226; 

Property insurance, which generally covers the financial consequences of accidental loss of an insured&#8217;s real and/or personal property. Property claims are generally reported and settled in a relatively short period of time. 

&#8226; 

Casualty insurance, which generally covers the financial consequences of employee injuries in the course of employment and bodily injury and/or property damage to a third party as a result of an insured&#8217;s negligent acts, omissions, or legal liabilities. Casualty claims may take several years to be reported and settled. 

&#8226; 

Flood insurance, which generally covers property losses under the Federal Government's Write Your Own ("WYO") Program of the NFIP. Flood insurance premiums and losses are 100% ceded to the NFIP. 

We underwrite our business primarily through traditional insurance. The following table shows the principal types of policies we write:

Product Development and Pricing 

Our insurance policies are contracts that specify our coverages - what we will pay to or for an insured upon a specified loss. We develop our coverages internally and by adopting and modifying forms and statistical data licensed from third party aggregators, notably Insurance Services Office, Inc. (&#8220;ISO&#8221;), American Association of Insurance Services, Inc. ("AAIS"), and the National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. ("NCCI"). Determining the price to charge for our coverages involves consideration of many variables. At the time we underwrite and issue a policy, we do not know what our actual costs for the policy will be in the future. To calculate and project future costs, we examine and analyze historical statistical data and factor in expected changes in loss trends. Additionally, we have developed predictive models for certain of our Standard Commercial and Standard Personal Lines. Predictive models analyze historical statistical data regarding our customers and their loss experience, rank our policies, or potential policies, based on this analysis, and apply this risk data to current and future customers to predict the likely profitability of an account. A model&#8217;s predictive capabilities are limited by the amount and quality of the statistical data available. As a regional insurance group, our loss experience is not always statistically large enough to analyze and project future costs. Consequently, we use ISO, AAIS, and NCCI data to supplement our proprietary data.

The following are general guidelines that can be used as indicators of the approximate size of our customers: 

&#8226; 

The average Standard Commercial Lines account size is $10,500. 

&#8226; 

The average Standard Personal Lines account size is $2,000. 

&#8226; 

The average E&#38;S Lines policy is $3,000. 

No one customer accounts for 10% or more of our insurance segments in the aggregate. 

Geographic Markets 

We principally sell in the following geographic markets: 

&#8226; 

Standard Commercial Lines products and services are primarily sold in 22 states located in the Eastern and Midwestern regions of the United States and the District of Columbia. 

&#8226; 

Standard Personal Lines products and services are primarily sold in 13 states located in the Eastern and Midwestern regions of the United States, except for the flood portion of this segment, which is sold in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 

&#8226; 

E&#38;S Lines are sold in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 

We believe this geographic diversification lessens our exposure to regulatory, competitive, and catastrophic risk. The following table lists the principal states in which we write business and the percentage of total NPW each represents for the last three fiscal years:

Distribution Channel 

We sell our insurance products and services through the following types of distribution partners: 

&#8226; 

Standard Commercial Lines: independent retail agents; 

&#8226; 

Standard Personal Lines: independent retail agents; and 

&#8226; 

E&#38;S Lines: wholesale general agents. 

We pay these distribution partners commissions and other consideration for business placed with us. We seek to compensate them fairly and in a manner consistent with market practices. No one distribution partner is responsible for 10% or more of our combined insurance segments' premium. 

As our customers rely heavily on our distribution partners, it is sometimes difficult to develop brand recognition as these customers cannot always differentiate between their insurance agents and their insurance carriers. We continue to evolve our service model, post policy-acquisition, with an increasing focus on the customer. Our goal is to provide our customers with 24/7 access to transactional capabilities and account information. Customers expect this level of access from every business and, while many insurers offer such solutions in the personal lines space, we want to be a leader in this area for the small commercial lines market. When combined with our digital strategy, we believe this level of access will significantly improve the customer experience. Within our digital strategy, we provide self-servicing capabilities via a mobile application and a web-based portal where our customers have access to basic account information on demand. These efforts will allow us to continue to offer customers a shared experience with our distribution partners, while positioning us to more directly demonstrate our value proposition. 

Independent Retail Agents 

According to a study released in 2015 by the Independent Insurance Agents &#38; Brokers of America, independent retail insurance agents and brokers write approximately 80% of standard commercial lines insurance and 35% of standard personal lines insurance in the United States. We believe that independent retail insurance agents will remain a significant force in overall insurance industry premium production because they represent more than one insurance carrier and therefore are able to provide a wider choice of commercial and personal lines insurance products and risk-based consultation to customers. 

We currently have approximately 1,100 independent retail agents selling our Standard Commercial Lines business, 700 of which also sell our Standard Personal Lines business (excluding flood). In total, these 1,100 distribution partners have approximately 2,100 office locations selling our business. In addition, we have approximately 6,000 distribution partners selling our flood insurance products. 

In a survey that we conducted in 2015, we received an overall satisfaction score of 8.6 out of 10 from our standard market distribution partners, which, we believe, highlighted their satisfaction with our products, the ease of reporting claims, and the professionalism and effectiveness of our employees. 

Wholesale General Agents 

E&#38;S Lines are written almost exclusively through approximately 80 wholesale general agents, who are our distribution partners in the E&#38;S market. We have granted contract binding authority to these partners for business that meets our prescribed underwriting and pricing guidelines. 

Marketing 

Our primary marketing strategy is to: 

&#8226; 

Use an empowered field underwriting model to provide our retail distribution partners with resources within close geographic proximity to their businesses and our customers. For further discussion on this, see the &#8220;Field Model and Technology&#8221; section below. 

&#8226; 

Develop close relationships with each distribution partner, as well as their principals and producers: (i) by soliciting their feedback on products and services; (ii) by advising them concerning our product developments; and (iii) through education and development focusing on producer recruitment, sales training, enhancing customer experience, online marketing, and distribution operations. 

&#8226; 

Develop with each distribution partner, and then carefully monitor, annual goals regarding: (i) types and mix of risks placed with us; (ii) amount of premium or number of policies placed with us; (iii) customer service and retention levels; and (iv) profitability of business placed with us. 

&#8226; 

Develop brand recognition with our customers through our marketing efforts, which include radio and television advertising, as well as advertising at certain national and local sporting events. 

Field Model and Technology 

We use the service mark &#8220;High-tech x High-touch = HT 2 SM &#8221; to describe our business strategy. &#8220;High-tech&#8221; refers to our technology that we use to make it easy for our distribution partners and customers to do business with us. &#8220;High-touch&#8221; refers to the close relationships that we have with our distribution partners and customers through our field business model. 

High Tech 

We leverage the use of technology in our business. We have made significant investments in information technology platforms, integrated systems, internet-based applications, and predictive modeling initiatives. We do this to provide: 

&#8226; 

Our distribution partners and our customers with access to accurate business information and the ability to process certain transactions from their locations, seamlessly integrating those transactions into our systems; 

&#8226; 

Our underwriters with targeted underwriting and pricing tools to enhance profitability while growing the business; 

&#8226; 

Our Special Investigations Unit ("SIU") investigators access to our business intelligence systems to better identify claims with potential fraudulent activities; 

&#8226; 

Our claims recovery and subrogation departments with the ability to expand and enhance their models through the use of our business intelligence systems; and 

&#8226; 

Our customers with 24/7 access to transactional capabilities and information through a web-based customer portal and a customer mobile application. 

We manage our information technology projects through an Enterprise Project Management Office (&#8220;EPMO&#8221;) governance model. The EPMO is supported by certified project managers who apply methodologies to: (i) communicate project management standards; (ii) provide project management training and tools; (iii) manage projects; (iv) review project status and cost; and (v) provide non-technology project management consulting services to the rest of the organization. The EPMO, which includes senior management representatives from all major business areas, corporate functions, and information technology, meets regularly to review all major initiatives and receives reports on the status of other projects. We believe the EPMO is an important factor in the success of our technology implementation. 

Our primary technology operations are located in Branchville, New Jersey and Glastonbury, Connecticut. We have agreements with multiple consulting, information technology, and service providers for supplemental staffing services. Collectively, these providers supply approximately 46% of our skilled technology capacity. We retain management oversight of all projects and ongoing information technology production operations. We believe we would be able to manage an efficient transition to new vendors without significant impact to our operations if we terminated an existing vendor. 

&#160; 

High Touch 

To support our distribution partners, we employ a field model for both underwriting and claims, with various employees in the field, usually working from home offices near our distribution partners. We believe that we build better and stronger relationships with our distribution partners because of the close proximity of our field employees, and the resulting direct interaction with our distribution partners and our customers. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 2,200 employees, of which 320 worked in the field, and 850 worked in one of our regional offices. 

Underwriting Process 

Our underwriting process requires communication and interaction among: 

&#8226; 

Our Agency Management Specialists (&#8220;AMSs&#8221;), who: (i) manage the growth and profitability of business that their assigned distribution partners write with us; and (ii) perform field underwriting for new Standard Commercial Lines business; 

&#8226; 

Our Standard Commercial Lines small business teams are responsible for handling: (i) new business in need of review that was submitted by our distribution partners through our automated underwriting platform, One &#38; Done &#174; ; and (ii) other new small accounts and middle market accounts with low underwriting complexity; 

&#8226; 

Our Standard Personal Lines Marketing Specialists (&#8220;PLMSs&#8221;) have primary responsibility for identifying new opportunities to grow our Standard Personal Lines; 

&#8226; 

Our E&#38;S territory managers have primary responsibility for identifying new opportunities to grow our E&#38;S Lines; 

&#8226; 

Our corporate underwriting department develops our underwriting appetite, products, policy forms, pricing, and underwriting guidelines for our standard market and E&#38;S market business; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Our corporate actuaries assist in the determination of rate and pricing levels, while monitoring pricing and profitability along with the Regions, corporate underwriting and business intelligence staff for our standard market and E&#38;S market business; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Our Regions establish and execute upon: (i) annual premium and pricing goals; (ii) specific new business targets by distribution partner; and (iii) profit improvement plans as needed across lines, states, and/or distribution partners; 

&#8226; 

Our distribution partners, which include independent retail agents for our standard market business and wholesale general agents for our E&#38;S market business, provide front-line underwriting within our prescribed guidelines; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Our regional underwriters manage the inforce policies for their assigned distribution partners, including but not limited to, managing profitability and pricing levels within their portfolios by developing policy-specific pricing; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Our Safety Management Specialists (&#8220;SMSs&#8221;) provide a wide range of front-line safety management services to our Standard Commercial Lines customers as discussed more fully below; 

&#8226; 

Our premium auditors supplement the underwriting process by working with insureds to accurately audit exposures for certain policies that we write; and 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Our field technical coordinators are responsible for technology assistance and training to aid our employees and our distribution partners. 

We have an underwriting service center (&#8220;USC&#8221;) located in Richmond, Virginia. The USC assists our distribution partners by servicing certain Standard Personal Lines and smaller Standard Commercial Lines accounts. At the USC, many of our employees are licensed agents who respond to customer inquiries about insurance coverage, billing transactions, and other matters. For the convenience of using the USC and our handling of certain transactions, our distribution partners agree to receive a slightly lower than standard commission for the premium associated with the USC. As of December 31, 2015, our USC was servicing Standard Commercial Lines NPW of $50.0 million and Standard Personal Lines NPW of $31.9 million. The $81.9 million total serviced by the USC represents 4% of our total NPW. 

As mentioned above, our field model provides a wide range of front-line safety management services focused on improving a Standard Commercial Lines insured&#8217;s safety and risk management programs. Our service mark &#8220;Safety Management: Solutions for a safer workplace&#8221; SM &#32;includes: (i) risk evaluation and improvement surveys intended to evaluate potential 

exposures and provide solutions for mitigation; (ii) internet-based safety management educational resources, including a large library of coverage-specific safety materials, videos and online courses, such as defensive driving and employee educational safety courses; (iii) thermographic infrared surveys aimed at identifying electrical hazards; and (iv) Occupational Safety and Health Administration construction and general industry certification training. Risk improvement efforts for existing customers are designed to improve loss experience and policyholder retention through valuable ongoing consultative service. Our safety management goal is to work with our customers to identify and eliminate potential loss exposures. 

Claims Management 

Effective, fair, and timely claims management is one of the most important services that we provide to our customers and distribution partners. It is also one of the critical factors in achieving underwriting profitability. We have structured our claims organization to emphasize: (i) cost-effective delivery of claims services and control of loss and loss expenses; and (ii) maintenance of timely and adequate claims reserves. In connection with our Standard Commercial Lines and Standard Personal Lines, we achieve better claim outcomes through a field model that locates claim representatives in close proximity to our customers and distribution partners. 

We have a claims service center (&#8220;CSC&#8221;), co-located with the USC, in Richmond, Virginia. The CSC receives first notices of loss from our customers and claimants related to our Standard Commercial Lines and Standard Personal Lines and manages routine automobile and property claims with no injuries. The CSC is designed to help: (i) reduce the claims settlement time on first- and third-party automobile property damage claims; (ii) increase the use of body shops, glass repair shops, and car rental agencies that have contracted with us at discounted rates and specified service levels; (iii) handle and settle small property claims; and (iv) investigate and negotiate auto liability claims. The CSC, as appropriate, will assign claims to the appropriate regional claims office or other specialized area within our claims organization. 

Claims Management Specialists (&#8220;CMSs&#8221;) are responsible for investigating and resolving the majority of our standard marketplace commercial automobile bodily injury, general liability, and property losses with low to moderate severities. Strategically located throughout our footprint, CMSs are able to provide highly responsive customer and distribution partner service to quickly resolve claims within their authority. Over the course of 2015, we made changes to our E&#38;S claims processing, which is now aligned with the processes used for our Standard Commercial Lines and Standard Personal Lines. E&#38;S claims are handled in our E&#38;S regional offices in Scottsdale, Arizona, and Horsham, Pennsylvania, and are segregated by line of business (property and liability). In the first quarter of 2015, our Quality Assurance Unit began conducting monthly file reviews on all of our operations to validate compliance with our quality claim handling standards. In addition, during the second half of the year, we further segregated our claims handling by litigation and complexity. Complex claims oversight is handled by the Complex Claims Unit ("CCU"). 

We have implemented specialized claims handling as follows: 

&#8226; 

Liability claims with high severity or technically complex losses are handled by the CCU. The CCU specialists are primarily field based and handle losses based on injury type or with severities greater than $250,000. 

&#8226; 

Litigated matters not meeting the CCU criteria are handled within our regional offices by our litigation claim units. These teams are aligned based upon jurisdictional knowledge and technical experience. In addition, they are supervised by litigation managers within the regional claim offices. These claims are segregated from the CMSs to allow for focused management. 

&#8226; 

Workers compensation claim handling is centralized in Charlotte, North Carolina. Jurisdictionally trained and aligned medical only and lost-time adjusters manage non-complex workers compensation claims within our footprint. Claims with high exposure and/or significant escalation risk are referred to the workers compensation strategic case management unit. 

&#8226; 

Property claims with high severity potential or technically complex losses are handled by either the Property Flex Unit or the Large Loss Unit. Both of these groups specifically handle only higher exposure property claims. The Large Loss Unit handles claims above $100,000 and the Property Flex Unit handles claims between $25,000 to $100,000. The Property Flex Unit also forms the core of our catastrophe team. 

&#8226; 

All asbestos and environmental claims are referred to our specialized corporate Environmental Unit, which also handles latent claims. 

This structure allows us to provide experienced adjusting to each claim category. 

Our insurance segments have an SIU that investigates potential insurance fraud and abuse, and supports efforts by regulatory bodies and trade associations to curtail the cost of fraud. The SIU adheres to uniform internal procedures to improve detection and take action on potentially fraudulent claims. It is our practice to notify the proper authorities of SIU findings, which we believe sends a clear message that we will not tolerate fraud against us or our customers. The SIU supervises anti-fraud training for all claims adjusters and AMSs. 

Insurance Operations Competition 

Our insurance segments face competition from public, private, and mutual insurance companies, which may have lower operating costs and/or lower cost of capital than we do. Some, like us, rely on partners for the distribution of their products and services and have competition within their distribution channel, making growth in market share difficult. Other insurance carriers either employ their own agents who only represent them or use a combination of distribution partners, captive agents, and direct marketing. The following provides information on the competition facing our insurance segments: 

Standard Commercial Lines 

The Standard Commercial Lines property and casualty insurance market is highly competitive and market share is fragmented among many companies. We compete with two types of companies, primarily on the basis of price, coverage terms, claims service, customer experience, safety management services, ease of technology usage, and financial ratings: 

&#8226; 

Regional insurers , such as Cincinnati Financial Corporation, Erie Indemnity Company, The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc., and United Fire Group, Inc.; and 

&#8226; 

National insurers , such as The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., Liberty Mutual Holding Company Inc., Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, The Travelers Companies, Inc., and Zurich Insurance Group, Ltd. 

Standard Personal Lines 

Our Standard Personal Lines face competition primarily from the regional and national carriers noted above, as well as companies such as State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company and Allstate Corporation. In addition, we face competition from direct insurers such as The Government Employees Insurance Company and The Progressive Corporation, which primarily offer personal auto coverage and market through a direct-to-consumer model. 

E&#38;S Lines 

Our E&#38;S Lines face competition from the E&#38;S subsidiaries of the regional and national carriers named above, as well as the following companies: 

&#8226; 

Nautilus Insurance Group, a member of W. R. Berkley Company; 

&#8226; 

Colony Specialty, a member of the Argo Group International Holding Ltd; 

&#8226; 

Western World Insurance Group, a member of the Validus Group; 

&#8226; 

Century Insurance Group, a member of the Meadowbrook Insurance Group; 

&#8226; 

The Burlington Insurance Company, a member of IFG Companies; 

&#8226; 

United States Liability Insurance Group, a member of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.; 

&#8226; 

Scottsdale Insurance Company, a member of Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company; and 

&#8226; 

Markel Corporation.

Insurance Regulation 

&#160; 

Primary Oversight by the States in Which We Operate 

Our insurance segments are heavily regulated. The primary public policy behind insurance regulation is the protection of policyholders and claimants over all other constituencies, including shareholders. By virtue of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, Congress has largely delegated insurance regulation to the various states. The primary market conduct and financial regulators of our Insurance Subsidiaries are the departments of insurance in the states in which they are organized and are licensed. For a discussion of the broad regulatory, administrative, and supervisory powers of the various departments of insurance, refer to the risk factor that discusses regulation in Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; of this Form 10-K. 

Our various state insurance regulators are members of the NAIC. The NAIC has codified SAP and other accounting reporting formats and drafts model insurance laws and regulations governing insurance companies. An NAIC model only becomes law when it is enacted in the various state legislatures or promulgated as a regulation by the state insurance department. The adoption of certain NAIC model laws and regulations, however, is a key aspect of the NAIC Financial Regulations Standards and Accreditation Program. 

NAIC Monitoring Tools 

Among the NAIC's various financial monitoring tools that are material to the regulators in states in which our Insurance Subsidiaries are organized are the following: 

&#8226; 

The Insurance Regulatory Information System (&#8220;IRIS&#8221;). IRIS identifies 13 industry financial ratios and specifies &#8220;usual values&#8221; for each ratio. Departure from the usual values on four or more of the financial ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance departments about certain aspects of the insurer's business. Our Insurance Subsidiaries have consistently met the majority of the IRIS ratio tests. 

&#8226; 

Risk-Based Capital. Risk-based capital is measured by four major areas of risk to which property and casualty insurers are exposed: (i) asset risk; (ii) credit risk; (iii) underwriting risk; and (iv) off-balance sheet risk. Insurers face a steadily increasing amount of regulatory scrutiny and potential intervention as their total adjusted capital declines below two times their "Authorized Control Level". Based on our 2015 statutory financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with SAP, the total adjusted capital for each of our Insurance Subsidiaries substantially exceeded two times their Authorized Control Level. 

&#8226; 

Annual Financial Reporting Regulation (referred to as the "Model Audit Rule"). The Model Audit Rule, which is modeled closely on the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, regulates: (i) auditor independence; (ii) corporate governance; and (iii) internal control over financial reporting. As permitted under the Model Audit Rule, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) of the Parent also serves as the audit committee of each of our Insurance Subsidiaries. 

&#8226; 

Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ("ORSA"). ORSA requires insurers to maintain a framework for identifying, assessing, monitoring, managing, and reporting on the &#8220;material and relevant risks&#8221; associated with the insurers' (or insurance groups') current and future business plans. ORSA, which has been adopted by the state insurance regulators of our Insurance Subsidiaries, requires companies to file an internal assessment of their solvency with insurance regulators annually, the first filing of which occurred in 2015. Although no specific capital adequacy standard is currently articulated in ORSA, it is possible that such standard will be developed over time and may increase insurers' minimum capital requirements, which could adversely impact our growth and return on equity. 

Federal Regulation 

Notable federal legislation and administrative policies that affect the insurance industry are: 

&#8226; 

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act ("TRIPRA"); 

&#8226; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;); and 

&#8226; 

Various privacy laws that apply to us because we have personal non-public information, including the: 

&#9702; 

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; 

&#9702; 

Fair Credit Reporting Act; 

&#9702; 

Drivers Privacy Protection Act; and 

&#9702; 

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. 

Like all businesses, we are required to enforce the economic and trade sanctions of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;). 

FEMA oversees the WYO Program enacted by Congress. Congress sets the WYO Program's budgeting, rules, and rating parameters. Two significant pieces of legislation that impact the WYO Program are the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 ("Bigger-Waters Act") and the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 ("Flood Affordability Act"). The Biggert-Waters Act: (i) extended the NFIP funding to September 30, 2017; and (ii) moved the program to more market based rates for certain flood policies. The Flood Affordability Act repealed and modified certain provisions in the Biggert-Waters Act regarding premium adjustments. 

In response to the financial markets crises in 2008 and 2009, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in 2010. This law provided for, among other things, the following: 

&#8226; 

The establishment of the Federal Insurance Office (&#8220;FIO&#8221;) under the United States Department of the Treasury; 

&#8226; 

Federal Reserve oversight of financial services firms designated as systemically important; and 

&#8226; 

Corporate governance reforms for publicly traded companies. 

The FIO continues to establish itself on national and international insurance issues after having issued its initial report regarding the modernization of insurance regulation in the United States. The report concluded that insurance regulation in the United States is best viewed in terms of a hybrid model, in which state and federal oversight play complementary roles defined by the strengths each brings to improving solvency and market conduct regulation. The FIO, Federal Reserve, and the NAIC are currently looking at oversight and solvency standards as they coordinate with international regulators regarding the future regulation of financial entities.

International Regulation 

We believe that development of global capital standards will influence the development of similar standards by domestic regulators. Notable international developments include the following: 

&#8226; 

In 2014, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors proposed Basic Capital Standards for Global Systemically Important Insurers as well as a uniform capital framework for internationally active insurers; and 

&#8226; 

The European Union has enacted Solvency II, which sets out new requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers operating in Europe, which was implemented in 2016.

The primary objective of the investment portfolio is to maximize after-tax investment income while balancing risk and generating long-term growth in shareholder value. Our investment philosophy is predicated on investing with a long-term horizon, with significant emphasis on risk control, capital preservation, taxes, liquidity, and diversification. Our investments include high-quality fixed maturity securities, common stocks and preferred securities designed to generate stable dividend income and long-term capital appreciation, and alternative investments that seek to diversify the sources of risk and return of the overall portfolio.
