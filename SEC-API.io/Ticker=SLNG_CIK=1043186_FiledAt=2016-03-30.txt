A key component of our Company&#8217;s strategy is our international focus. We have three primary models for conducting our international business. First, where local market conditions dictate, we have expanded internationally by forming joint venture operations with local partners in key markets such as China and Singapore, where we can partner with the primary end-customer in that market, or there are local content requirements or a competitive advantage to using local manufacturing. 

Second, we sell through foreign sales agents that we have appointed in energy regions around the world. Many of these international partners also provide local service and support for our products in those overseas markets. 

Finally, we have expanded our international footprint by forming our first wholly-owned foreign subsidiary to serve the Brazil electrical service market. 

Our business strategy is to grow through organic growth in our current key energy markets, expand our solution set to our current markets, continue our international expansion, and accelerate those efforts with acquisitions, while at the same time increasing earnings and cash flow per share to enhance overall stockholder value. 

The Company is uniquely positione d to be the &#8220;turn-key&#8221; supplier for power delivery projects for our customers, where we are able to offer custom-designed power distribution and power conversion systems, power services, and electrical and instrumentation construction, all from one company . 

Products and Services 

We have provided sophisticated custom-designed power distribution, power conversion, and automation and control systems for our customers since 1946. Our products are used to safely distribute and control the flow of electricity from the source of the power being generated (e.g. a diesel generator or the utility grid) to whatever mechanical device needs to use the power (drilling machinery, motors, other process equipment, etc.) at low and medium voltages. 

Our power distribution products include low and medium voltage switchgear that provides power distribution and protection for electrical systems from electrical faults. Our products include traditional low voltage and medium voltage switchgear, as well as a variety of arc-managed and arc-resistant switchgear to increase end-user safety in case of an arc-flash explosion. Our products are suitable for both American National Standards Institute (&#8220;ANSI&#8221;) and International Electrotechnical Commission (&#8220;IEC&#8221;) markets. Other power distribution products in our solution set include low voltage and medium voltage motor control centers, bus ducts, fuse and switch products, and other related power distribution equipment. We also bundle third party products per our customer specifications including items such as battery backup power systems and transformers.

Our new IntelliSafe&#8482; medium voltage Arc-resistant switchgear product line is designed for the downstream sector, process industries and the power generation market, IntelliSafe is built with the goal of being the safest arc-resistant product on the market, and meets key industry specifications and certifications.

Our power conversion solutions include analog, digital silicon controlled rectifier (&#8220;SCR&#8221;) and alternating current variable frequency drive (&#8220;AC VFD&#8221;) systems, that are used to adjust the speed and torque of an electric motor to match various user applications, primarily in the land and offshore drilling and marine vessel markets. 

Our automation and control solutions are programmable logic controllers (&#8220;PLC&#8221;) based systems designed for the management and control of power in a user&#8217;s application. Our DrillAssist&#8482; for land and offshore drilling are control systems that enable the management of an entire drilling rig&#8217;s operations. DrillAssist&#8482; includes auto-drill capabilities and a driller&#8217;s chair and cabin where the drilling rig operator manages the rig. 

Our Power Distribution Centers (&#8220;PDC&#8221;) are a critical element of our turnkey solution set and are used to house our power distribution and power conversion products. Our PDCs can be manufactured over 100 ft. long and 40 ft. wide. The Company also manufactures VFD and SCR houses for land drilling and driller&#8217;s cabins for land and offshore deployment.

We have the technical expertise to provide these solutions in compliance with a number of applicable industry standards such as National Electrical Manufacturers Association (&#8220;NEMA&#8221;) and ANSI or IEC equipment to meet American Bureau of Shipping (&#8220;ABS&#8221;), United States Coast Guard (&#8220;USCG&#8221;), Lloyd&#8217;s Register, a provider of marine certification services, and Det Norske Veritas (a leading certification body/registrar for management systems certification services) standards. 

Our power distribution and control products are generally custom-designed to our customers&#8217; specific requirements, and we do not maintain an inventory of such products. 

We provide services to commission and maintain our customers&#8217; electrical power conversion and controls systems. We also provide low and medium voltage start-up/commissioning, preventative maintenance, emergency call out services, and breaker and switchgear refurbishment services.

We offer a full range of electrical and instrumentation construction and installation services to our markets. These services include new construction as well as electrical and instrumentation turnarounds, maintenance and renovation projects. Applications include installation of switchgear, AC and DC motors, drives, motor controls, lighting systems and high voltage cable. Much of this work is generated from the installation (&#8220;rig-up&#8221;) of our power delivery solutions into our packaged power control systems.

Foreign Joint Ventures 

We use foreign joint ventures to accommodate business in China and South East Asia. We believe our foreign joint ventures provide a prudent way to diversify and reduce the risk of international expansion, capitalize on the strengths and the relationships of our foreign joint venture partners with potential customers, and achieve competitive advantages. Our interests in foreign joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Sales made to the foreign joint ventures are made with terms and conditions similar to those of our other customers. 

China. In March 2006, M&#38;I Electric entered into a joint venture agreement with Baoji Oilfield Machinery Co., Ltd., (&#8220;BOMCO&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the China National Petroleum Corporation, and AA Energies, Inc. of Houston, Texas, which markets oilfield equipment, to form BOMAY Electric Industries Co., Ltd. (&#8220;BOMAY&#8221;), as an equity joint venture limited liability company organized in China. M&#38;I is a 40% interest owner in BOMAY with 51% being owned by BOMCO and the remaining 9% owned by AA Energies, Inc. BOMAY manufactures power and control systems for land drilling rigs. M&#38;I has invested 16 million Yuan (approximately $2 million) in this joint venture in which M&#38;I provides technology and services to BOMAY. Each of 

the BOMAY investors may be required to guarantee the bank loans of BOMAY in proportion to their investment. No guarantees have been provided by AETI at this time. 

Singapore. In 1994, the Company formed a joint venture in Singapore to provide sales, engineering, manufacturing and technical support for our products in Southeast Asia called M &#38; I Electric Far East PTE Ltd. (&#8220;MIEFE&#8221;). The Company currently owns 41% of the joint venture with our joint venture partner, Sonepar, owning 51% and MIEFE&#8217;s general manager owning the remaining 8%. 

Brazil. During 2010, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Five Star Services, a Brazilian corporation, and formed AETI Alliance Group do Brazil Sistemas E Servicos Em Energia LTDA (&#8220;AAG&#8221;), a Brazilian Limited Liability Company, in which the Company held a 49% interest. AAG began operations mid-year 2010, and provided electrical products and services to the Brazilian energy industries. Effective April 30, 2014, the Company withdrew from this joint venture and formed M&#38;I Brazil, a wholly-owned subsidiary.

Numbers are reflected in the investment balance as of end of year. 

During 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized approximately $0.39 million and $0.52 million respectively, for employee joint venture related expenses which are included in Foreign Joint Ventures Operation&#8217;s Related Expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

International Sales 

During 2015, approximately 15% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenue was systems sold or shipped into international markets. Sales from the U.S are generally made in U.S. dollars and settled prior to shipment or are collateralized by irrevocable letters of credit. M&#38;I Brazil&#8217;s sales are generally made in Brazilian Reals.

Marketing 

We market our products and services in the United States through direct contact with potential customers by our internal sales organization consisting of 17 full-time sales and sales support employees. We also exhibit at a variety of industry trade shows each year. We have several sales agreements with agents and distributors in the United States and several foreign countries. M&#38;I Brazil markets in Brazil and other South American countries. 

Our business is generally obtained through a competitive bid process where the lowest bid from pre-qualified suppliers is awarded the project. Depending on the market segment, we either sell directly to the end user or owner, a shipyard or rig builder, or, sell to an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (&#8220;EPC&#8221;) firm representing the end project owner. 

Manufacturing 

Manufacturing processes at our various facilities include machining, fabrication, wiring, subassembly, system assembly and final testing. We have invested in various automated and semi-automated equipment for the fabrication and machining of various parts and assemblies that we incorporate into our products. Our quality assurance program includes various quality control measures from inspection of raw material, purchased parts and assemblies through on-line inspection. We perform system design, assembly and testing in-house. The company significantly expanded our main manufacturing operation in Beaumont, Texas in 2014. The manufacturing operation in Beaumont, Texas is ISO 9001:2008 certified. 

Raw Materials and Suppliers 

The principal raw materials for our products are copper, steel, aluminum and various manufactured electrical components. We obtain these products from a number of domestic and foreign suppliers. The market for most of the raw materials and parts we use is comprised of numerous participants and we believe that we can obtain each of the raw materials we require from more than one supplier. We do not have any long-term contractual arrangements with the suppliers of our raw materials. 

Competition 

Our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets. We compete in all of our markets and regions with a number of companies, some of which have financial and other resources comparable to or greater than us. Due to the demanding 

operating conditions in the energy sector and the high costs associated with project delays and equipment failure, we believe customers in this industry prefer suppliers with a track record of proven, reliable performance in their specific energy related project type. We seek to build strong long-term relationships with our customers by providing high-quality, efficient and reliable products and services, developing new products and services and responding promptly to our customers&#8217; needs. 

The principal competitive factors in our markets are product and service quality and reliability, lead time, price, technical expertise and reputation. 

We believe our principal competitive strengths include the following: 

Our power delivery, control and drive systems are custom-designed and are built to meet our customers&#8217; specific requirements. We specialize in projects that are complex, require industry certification, have short lead times or other non-standard elements, such as systems that must be deployed in harsh environments or need to meet tight space or weight requirements. Our ability to provide custom-designed technical products, electrical and instrumentation construction services, and electrical startup and preventative maintenance services is unique, enabling us to provide customers total system responsibility for their electrical power control and distribution needs. 

Our commitment to providing quality products and services, fair pricing, innovation and customer service is the foundation to the long-standing customer relationships that we enjoy with an attractive customer base. Since 1946, we have provided over 10,000 power delivery systems to many of the leading companies involved in oil and gas exploration, drilling, production, pipelines, shipbuilding, oil refineries, petrochemicals, power generation, and steel industries in the United States. 

We are led by an experienced management team with a proven track record. We believe the experience of our management team provides us with an in-depth understanding of our customers&#8217; needs and enhances our ability to deliver customer-driven solutions. We believe our management has fostered a culture of loyalty, resulting in high employee retention rates for our professional and technical employees. 

The Company has multiple competitive advantages for our products:

&#160;

&#45; 

Custom design 

&#160;

&#45; 

Turn-key solutions including in-house manufacturing of Power Distribution Centers (&#8220;PDC&#8217;s&#8221;). 

&#160;

&#45; 

Quick delivery time 

&#160;

&#45; 

Able to use best of breed components and mix and match subsystems from a variety of vendors versus an all one supplier solution 

&#160;

&#45; 

Ability to provide integrated solution by self-performing our Technical Products and Electrical &#38;Instrumentation construction work. 

We have identified our largest competitors, by product line as follows: 

&#160;

&#45; 

Power Distribution/Switchgear Systems&#8212;Powell Industries, Siemens, Eaton, GE, ABB and Volta. 

&#160;

&#45; 

Power Conversion/Drive Systems&#8212;Omron, National Oilwell Varco (NOV), ABB, and Siemens. 

Backlog 

Backlog represents the dollar amount of net sales that we expect to realize in the future as a result of performing work under multi-month contracts. Backlog is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting principles, and our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results. Not all of our potential net sales are recorded in backlog for a variety of reasons, including the fact that some contracts begin and end within a short-term period. Many contracts are subject to modification or termination by the customer. The termination or modification of any one or more sizeable contracts or the addition of other contracts may have a substantial and immediate effect on backlog. Our backlog does not include any backlog in place at our foreign joint ventures&#8217; operations. 

We generally include total expected net sales in backlog when a contract for a definitive amount of work is entered into. We generally expect our backlog to become net sales within a year from the signing of a contract. Backlog as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled $19.0 million and $26.5 million, respectively. 

Intellectual Property 

We have a number of trademarks and trade names utilized with our products and services. While proprietary intellectual property is important to the Company, management believes the loss or expiration of any intellectual property right would not materially impact the Company. The company has recently filed for several patents relating to its new IntelliSafe&#8482; medium voltage arc-resistant switchgear product line.

Environmental Laws 

We are subject to various federal, state, and local laws enacted for the protection of the environment. We believe we are in compliance with such laws. Our compliance has, to date, had no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. 

Research and Development Costs 

Total expenditures for research and development were $0.77 million and $0.81 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. We incurred research costs to develop new products for our energy-related markets including new power distribution, power conversion and automation and control products. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 235 employees. No employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
