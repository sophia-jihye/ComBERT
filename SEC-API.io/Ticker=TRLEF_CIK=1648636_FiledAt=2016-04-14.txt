 ITEM 1. BUSINESS Name and Organization 

Park Place Energy Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;PPEI Delaware&#148;) is the successor registrant (&#147;Successor Registrant&#148;) to Park Place Energy Corp, a Nevada corporation (&#147;PPEC Nevada&#148;), following a reincorporation merger, approved by the stockholders of PPEC Nevada at a special meeting of stockholders on November 11, 2015 (the &#147;Special Meeting&#148;) and effected November 12, 2015 (the &#147;Reincorporation&#148;) to provide a better organizational structure for future acquisitions and management of operations. The consolidated assets and liabilities of the Successor Registrant immediately after the Reincorporation were the same as the consolidated assets and liabilities of PPEC Nevada immediately prior to it. PPEC Nevada, which is now the wholly owned subsidiary of PPEI Delaware, holds substantially all of the consolidated assets and liabilities immediately following the Reincorporation. 

Pursuant to the Reincorporation, PPEC Nevada merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of PPEI Delaware, with PPEC Nevada continuing as the surviving entity and as a wholly owned subsidiary of PPEI Delaware., and each share of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share of PPEC Nevada was automatically converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of PPEI Delaware. In addition, PPEI Delaware has another subsidiary, BG Exploration BOOD, a company incorporated under the laws of Bulgaria. 

In connection with the Reincorporation, PPEI Delaware assumed PPEC Nevada&#146;s 2013 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the &#147;2013 Plan&#148;) and PPEC Nevada&#146;s 2011 Stock Option Plan (the &#147;2011 Plan&#148;), which we collectively refer to as the &#147;Incentive Plans.&#148; PPEI Delaware also assumed all options to purchase PPEC Nevada common stock and all restricted stock unit awards that were outstanding under the Incentive Plans at the time of the Reincorporation. The reserve of PPEC Nevada common stock under the Incentive Plans was automatically converted on a one-share-for-one-share basis into shares of PPEI Delaware common stock. The terms and conditions that were in effect immediately prior to the Reincorporation under each outstanding equity award assumed by PPEI Delaware continue in full force and effect after the Reincorporation, except that the shares of common stock issuable under each such award will be shares of PPEI Delaware common stock. 

Also in connection with the Reincorporation, PPEI Delaware assumed all outstanding warrants to purchase PPEC Nevada common stock. The terms and conditions of the warrants that were in effect immediately prior to the Reincorporation continue in full force and effect after the Reincorporation, except that the shares of common stock issuable under each such warrant will be shares of PPEI Delaware common stock. 

Following the Reincorporation, PPEI Delaware&#146;s common stock trades on the OTCQB market under the symbol &#147;PKPL&#148; and PPEI Delaware uses the same CUSIP number as previously used by PPEC Nevada. 

The directors and executive officers of PPEI Delaware immediately following the Reincorporation are the same individuals who were directors and executive officers, respectively, of PPEC Nevada immediately prior to the Reincorporation. 

Upon completion of the Reincorporation, PPEI Delaware common stock was deemed to be registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) promulgated thereunder. For purposes of Rule 12g-3(a), PPEI Delaware is the successor issuer to PPEC Nevada. 

Throughout this Annual Report, unless the context otherwise states all references to &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; &#147;our,&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148; refer to PPEC Nevada prior to the Reincorporation, and PPEI Delaware from and after the Reincorporation, in each case, along with their subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. 

&#160;

General 

Park Place Energy Inc. is an energy company engaged in exploration for oil and natural gas, primarily in the Dobrich region of northeast Bulgaria. Our corporate headquarters are located at 2200 Ross Avenue, Suite 4500, Dallas, Texas 75201. The Company also has a registered office in Bulgaria. 

Today, the operations of our Company and its subsidiary concentrate on natural gas exploration in the Dobrich region of northeast Bulgaria. We continue to look for new opportunities in other countries with particular focus on Eastern Europe. Our goal is to become a producer of natural gas in Bulgaria and other countries. 

The Company entered into a share purchase agreement on December 22, 2015 to acquire the three subsidiaries of Tiway Oil B.V. (&#147;Tiway&#148;), a company currently in bankruptcy in the Netherlands. These Tiway subsidiaries are oil and gas exploration and production companies operating in the Republic of Turkey. They own interests in 3 producing oil and gas fields, one offshore and two onshore, as well as a number of exploration licenses and operate one of the onshore fields. Current production for the Tiway subsidiaries is about 430 Boe/d (barrels per day equivalent). The purchase price is $2.1 million USD and the Company paid at signing a $500,000 deposit toward the purchase price. Prior to submitting the winning bid in the bankruptcy auction, the Company spent the prior 6 months actively gathering and evaluating a large amount of data derived from earlier exploration and production activities on these Tiway properties. 

The transaction is subject to obtaining the approval of two regulatory agencies in Turkey, the GDPA, which regulates the oil and gas licenses, and EMRA, which regulates gas marketing. The applications, plus supplementary materials, have been submitted. During the period prior to closing, in consultation with the Tiway staff and partners in the various fields, the Company has prepared work programs for the upcoming 2016 year and into the future. 

While the transaction was originally scheduled for closing March 31, 2016, that date has been extended until April 28, 2016 to allow sufficient time to secure the approvals from the respective regulatory agencies. To facilitate closing, the Company has formed a new subsidiary, Park Place Energy (Bermuda) Ltd. which will become the acquirer of the shares of the Tiway subsidiaries. 

Bulgaria License 

In 2010, we revamped our business strategy to focus on obtaining gas properties in Europe. We were attracted to the high price of natural gas and shortage of supply on the European continent. We also saw the possibility of prolonged depressed natural gas prices in North America. 

In October of 2010, we were awarded an exploration permit for the &#147;Vranino 1-11 Block&#148;, a 98,205 acre oil and gas exploration land located in Dobrudja Basin, Bulgaria, by the Bulgarian Counsel of Ministers. On April 1, 2014, the Company entered into an Agreement for Crude Oil and Natural Gas Prospecting and Exploration in the Vranino 1-11 Block with the Ministry of Economy and Energy of Bulgaria (the &#147;License Agreement&#148;). The initial term of the License Agreement is five years. This five-year period will commence once the Bulgarian regulatory authorities approve of the Company&#146;s work programs for the permit area. The License Agreement (or applicable legislation) provides for possible extension periods for up to five additional years during the exploration phase, as well as the conversion of the License Agreement to an exploitation concession, which can last for up to 35 years. Under the License Agreement, the Company will submit a yearly work program that is subject to approval of the Bulgarian regulatory authorities. 

The Company&#146;s commitment is to perform geological and geophysical exploration activities in the first 3 years of the initial term (the &#147;Exploration and Geophysical Work Stage&#148;), followed by drilling activities in years 4 and 5 of the initial term (the &#147;Data Evaluation and Drilling Stage&#148;). The Company is required to drill 10,000 meters (approximately 32,800 feet) of new wellbore (which may be vertical, horizontal or diagonal) and conduct other exploration activities during the initial term. 

Pursuant to the License Agreement, the Company is obligated to incur minimum costs during the initial term as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; (i) $925,000 for the Exploration and Geophysical Work Stage; and 

&#160;

&#160; (ii) $3,675,000 for the Data Evaluation and Drilling Stage. 

In addition, during the term of the License Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay an annual land rental fee of 15,897 BGN (US $9,109 based on the exchange rate of .573 Lev to Dollar as of March 21, 2016). 

&#160;

The Company is permitted to commence limited production during the initial term of the License Agreement. Upon confirmation of a commercial discovery, the Company is entitled to convert the productive area of the license to an exploitation concession that may last for up to 35 years provided that the minimum work commitments are satisfied. 

Before the license for the Bulgarian CBM project is &#147;effective&#148;, the Company&#146;s overall work program and first year annual work program must be approved by both the Bulgarian environmental ministry and the energy ministry. On August 26, 2014, the Bulgarian environmental agency approved the Company&#146;s overall work program and first year annual work program. A number of parties appealed the decision of the environmental agency and an appeal proceeding was commenced before an administrative judge panel. Since then, there have been several hearings resulting in a number of appellants being dismissed and empaneling a panel of experts to confirm the correctness of the approval by the environmental agency. The next hearing is not currently scheduled. The Company is participating in that proceeding as an interested party. The initial term of the License Agreement will not begin until (i) the appeals proceeding is completed and the decision upheld and (ii) the Bulgarian energy agency has approved the Company&#146;s work programs. 

The Company is continuing its data gathering, evaluation and planning, is acquiring the land for future well sites and is performing an environmental baseline survey of the license area. We are engaged in identifying the availability of drilling and other oilfield services in the vicinity of the permit area. We have located several suitable service providers for drilling and other services that we intend to engage at the appropriate time. Local companies in Bulgaria will be used to provide services to the extent feasible. However, the Bulgarian energy sector is relatively undeveloped; accordingly, the availability of local services specialized to meet our requirements may be limited. Park Place has determined that such expertise, services or equipment may be available in Romania, Turkey or other countries in the vicinity. 

Patents and Trademarks 

We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patent or trademark. 

Research and Development Expenditures 

We have not incurred any research or development expenditures since our incorporation. 

Government Regulation 

Our current or future operations, including exploration and development activities on our properties, require permits from various governmental authorities, and such operations are and will be governed by laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which we are conducting business, which at the present time is Bulgaria. These laws and regulations concern exploration, development, production, exports, taxes, labor laws and standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection and other matters. Compliance with these requirements may prove to be difficult and expensive. Due to our international operations, we are subject to the following issues and uncertainties that can affect our operations adversely: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the risk of expropriation, nationalization, war, revolution, political instability, border disputes, renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, and import, export and transportation regulations and tariffs; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; laws of foreign governments affecting our ability to fracture stimulate oil or natural gas wells, such as the legislation enacted in Bulgaria in January 2012, discussed in greater detail below; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the risk of not being able to procure residency and work permits for our expatriate personnel; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; exchange controls, currency fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over international operations; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the possibility of being subjected to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the possibility of restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital from foreign countries. 

&#160;

Permits and Licenses . In order to carry out exploration and development of oil and natural gas interests or to place these interests into commercial production, we may require certain licenses and permits from various governmental authorities. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain all necessary licenses and permits that may be required. In addition, such licenses and permits are subject to change and there can be no assurances that any application to renew any existing licenses or permits will be approved. 

Repatriation of Earnings . Currently, there are no restrictions on the repatriation of earnings or capital to foreign entities from Bulgaria. However, there can be no assurance that any such restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital from the aforementioned countries or any other country where we may invest will not be imposed in the future. 

Environmental . The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulations in Bulgaria. Environmental regulations establish standards respecting health, safety and environmental matters and place restrictions and prohibitions on emissions of various substances produced concurrently with oil and natural gas. The regulatory requirements cover the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products and waste created by water and air pollution control procedures. These regulations may have an impact on the selection of drilling locations and facilities, potentially resulting in increased capital expenditures. In addition, environmental legislation may require those wells and production facilities to be abandoned and sites reclaimed to the satisfaction of local authorities. Such regulation has increased the cost of planning, designing, drilling, operating and, in some instances, abandoning wells. We are committed to complying with environmental and operation legislation wherever we operate. 

There has been a recent surge in interest among the media, government regulators and private citizens concerning the possible negative environmental and geological effects of fracture stimulation. Some have alleged that fracture stimulation results in the contamination of aquifers and may even contribute to seismic activity. In January 2012, the government of Bulgaria enacted legislation that banned the fracture stimulation of oil and natural gas wells in Bulgaria and imposed large monetary penalties on companies that violate that ban. Such legislation or regulations could impact our ability to drill and complete wells, and could increase the cost of planning, designing, drilling, completing and operating wells. We are committed to complying with legislation and regulations involving fracture stimulation wherever we operate. 

Such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own negligence, but may also expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. We may incur significant costs as a result of environmental accidents, such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures, or discharges of hazardous materials into the environment, including clean-up costs and fines or penalties. Additionally, we may incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations and may be forced to pay fines or penalties if we do not comply. 

Competition 

Currently one company, Gazprom, supplies Bulgaria with virtually all natural gas being marketed and consumed in Bulgaria through a pipeline that runs through Ukraine from Russia. On a regional level, we compete for license blocks and capital with other oil and gas exploration companies and independent producers who are actively seeking oil and natural gas properties throughout the world. 

The principal area of competition is encountered in the financial ability of our Company to acquire acreage positions and drill wells to explore for oil and natural gas, then, if warranted, install production equipment. Competition for the acquisition of oil and gas license areas is high in Europe. Therefore, we may or may not be successful in acquiring additional blocks in the face of this competition. Presently, we are not seeking additional license blocks. 

&#160;

From a general standpoint, we operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas exploration, development, production and acquisition with a substantial number of other companies, including U.S.-based and international companies doing business in each of the countries in which we operate. We face intense competition from independent, technology-driven companies as well as from both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies in each of the following areas: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; seeking oil and natural gas exploration licenses and production licenses and leases; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; acquiring desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; marketing oil and natural gas production; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; integrating new technologies; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; contracting for drilling services and equipment and securing the expertise necessary to develop and operate properties. 

Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, managerial, technological and other resources than we do. To the extent competitors are able to pay more for properties than we are paying, we will be at a competitive disadvantage. Further, many of our competitors enjoy technological advantages over us and may be able to implement new technologies more rapidly than we can. Our ability to explore for and produce oil and natural gas prospects and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully conduct operations, implement advanced technologies, evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment.
