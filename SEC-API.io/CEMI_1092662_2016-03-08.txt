Our Business

&#160;

General

&#160;

The Company (Chembio Diagnostics, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc. are collectively referred to herein as the "Company") develops, manufactures, markets and licenses rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests (POCTs) that detect infectious diseases. The Company's main products presently commercially available are rapid tests for the detection of HIV 1/2 antibodies, and a multiplex rapid test for the detection of HIV and Syphilis antibodies. The HIV 1/2 rapid tests employ in-licensed and proprietary lateral flow technologies (see "Our Rapid Test Technologies"), can be used with all blood matrices as samples, and are manufactured in a standard cassette format, a dipstick format, and a proprietary barrel format. The tests employing the cassette and proprietary barrel formats were approved by the FDA in 2006. The barrel format is exclusively distributed by a distributor in the United States and by Chembio and its designated distributors outside the United States. The exclusive U.S. distribution agreement for the barrel product terminates in accordance with its terms on May 31, 2016. Chembio and any newly designated distributors will distribute the product in the U.S. after May 31, 2016. The Cassette format is distributed by Chembio and its designated distributors worldwide. Our latest generation HIV 1/2 rapid antibody detection test incorporates our patented Dual Path Platform&#174; (DPP&#174;) POCT technology, and this POCT platform does not require in-licensing. The DPP&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay detects antibodies to HIV 1 &#38; 2 in oral fluid samples as well as in all blood matrices. We have sold this product in Brazil since 2009 where it was approved by ANVISA, through our agreement with the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation ("FIOCRUZ"), and we received United States FDA regulatory approval for this product in December 2012 and CLIA waiver in October 2014. We launched it in the United States under Chembio's brand in the fourth quarter of 2014.

&#160;

Our product pipeline, which currently includes a multiplex rapid test for earlier detection of HIV by detecting P-24 antigen as well as antibodies, a test for Hepatitis-C, and a multiplex test that detects HIV and Syphilis specific antibodies (which we are already selling outside the U.S.), is based on this DPP&#174; technology for which we were issued a United States patent in 2007 and for which additional patent protection has issued or is pending in a number of other countries. With the patented DPP&#174; and the lateral flow platform, we participate in the estimated $8 billion point-of-care market segment of the estimated nearly $50 billion global in-vitro diagnostic market that has an overall growth rate exceeding 3% per annum. POCTs, by providing prompt and early diagnosis, can reduce patient stays, lower overall costs, improve therapeutic interventions and improve patient outcomes. POCTs can also prevent needless hospital admissions, simplify testing procedures, avoid delays from central lab batching, and eliminate the need for return visits.

&#160;

In the areas of infectious and sexually transmitted diseases (such as HIV and syphilis), the utility of a rapid point&#8211;of-care (POC) test, particularly in identifying patients unaware of their disease status, has been well established. Large and growing markets have been established for these kinds of tests, initially in high prevalence regions where they are indispensable for large scale prevention and treatment programs. More recently introduced in the United States in 2004, rapid HIV tests now also present a significant segment of the U.S. market for HIV clinical testing, which is still dominated by laboratory tests. We have focused our product development activity within areas where the availability of rapid, point-of-care screening, diagnostic, or confirmatory results can improve health outcomes. More generally we believe there is and will continue to be a growing demand for diagnostic products that can provide accurate, actionable diagnostic information in a rapid, cost-effective manner at the point of care.

&#160;

PRODUCTS

&#160;

Lateral Flow Rapid HIV Tests

&#160;

All three of our lateral flow rapid HIV antibody detection tests are qualitative "yes/no" tests for the detection of antibodies to HIV 1 &#38; 2 with visually interpreted results (one line "negative"; one line "positive") available within approximately 15 minutes. The tests are simple to use, have a shelf life of 24 months, and do not require refrigeration. The tests differ principally only in the method of test procedure, convenience and cost. One of our FDA-approved lateral flow HIV tests incorporates a proprietary plastic "barrel" device that houses the lateral flow strip. This barrel format enables collection of samples directly (usually from a finger-stick whole blood sample) into the barrel's capillary tip. A sealed unitized buffer vial, assembled onto the top of the barrel, is removed and seated into a stand; the seal is then pierced by the barrel's capillary tip, thereby initiating the upward flow of the resulting sample-buffer solution through a filter, up into the vertical device's chamber and onto the lateral flow strip. This results in a unique unitized and closed device system that can reduce the chance of exposure to potentially infectious samples.

&#160;

In January 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with StatSure Diagnostic Systems, Inc. (SDS) to acquire SDS' interest in the barrel device format, also known as Chembio's SURE CHECK&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay, effective June 1, 2016. Beginning June 1, 2016, Chembio will own full rights related to the SURE CHECK&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay, including sales, marketing, distribution and trademark rights, subject to the terms of the existing marketing and distribution agreement with Alere, Inc., which grants Alere U.S. marketing and distribution rights through May 31, 2016. Prior to this newly-executed agreement between SDS and Chembio, SDS has owned a 50 percent interest in the rights to the SURE CHECK&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay that would have continued after May 31, 2016, also subject to the existing marketing and distribution agreement with Alere. The new agreement with SDS also resolves all other matters between Chembio and SDS, including their respective sharing ratios, until June 1, 2016, concerning net revenues from sale of the SURE CHECK&#174; product outside the U.S.

&#160;

The Company's SURE CHECK&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay is marketed exclusively in the U.S. as Clearview&#174; Complete pursuant to an exclusive distribution agreement that terminates in accordance with its terms on May 31, 2016. After May 31, 2016, it will be marketed in the U.S. as Sure Check&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay. Outside the U.S., Chembio markets the SURE CHECK&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay primarily through distributors. The SURE CHECK&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay is Food &#38; Drug Administration (FDA) approved, CLIA-waived, European CE-marked, and has been pre-qualified by the World Health Organization (WHO). Results are obtained in 15 minutes via a 2.5uL blood sample (i.e., fingerstick, serum, plasma, or venipuncture whole blood). The assay is stable at room temperature and provides 99.7% sensitivity and 99.9% specificity.

&#160;

Our other FDA-approved lateral flow HIV test uses a more conventional rectangular plastic cassette format that houses the lateral flow strip. In this case, a sample is transferred by use of a separately provided transfer device ("loop") into a sample well or port of the cassette that houses the lateral flow strip, which is positioned horizontally or flat.

&#160;

Our third lateral flow HIV test, the HIV 1/2 STAT PAK&#174; Dipstick, is our most cost competitive and compact format. It does not have any plastic housing so that 30 test strips can be packaged into a small vial that is ideal for transporting into remote settings. The test procedure is similar to the cassette format except that a user-applied adhesive backing is provided as a more cost-effective and compact "surface" on which to run the test.

&#160;

Regulatory Status of the lateral flow HIV tests

&#160;

The FDA approved our Pre-Market Applications (hereinafter "PMA"; see "Governmental Regulations" and Glossary) in April 2006 for our SURE CHECK&#174; HIV 1/2 (and also now Alere Clearview&#174; Complete HIV 1/2) and for our HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK&#174; products. Waivers under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (hereinafter "CLIA"; see Governmental Regulations) were granted by the FDA for these two FDA-approved products in 2006 and 2007, respectively. A CLIA waiver is required in order for health care providers to administer these tests in the settings where they are most suited and needed, such as public health testing clinics, hospital emergency rooms and physicians' offices. The SURE CHECK&#174; and HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK&#174; products received CE Marks in July 2013 and March 2014, respectively, and the CE Marking for the DPP&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay received in May 2015. We have also updated our filing for CE Marking to reflect the new tradename of STAT-VIEW&#174; HIV 1 / 2 Assay for sale in the EU market. Our HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK&#174; Dipstick, although not FDA-approved, qualifies under FDA export regulations [See Government Regulation] to sell to customers outside the United States, subject to any required approval by the importing country. CE Mark has not been pursued for this product.

&#160;

All three of our lateral flow HIV tests have qualified for procurement under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ("PEPFAR"). The cassette and dipstick versions of the STAT-PAK&#174; and the SURE CHECK&#174; assays are also pre-qualified by the World Health Organization (WHO) for procurements by the second largest global program, known as the Global Fund, as well as other related programs funded by agencies affiliated with the United Nations, such as UNICEF and UNITAIDS (see Glossary), through qualification with the WHO bulk procurement scheme.

&#160;

DPP&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay

&#160;

As in the case of our lateral flow HIV tests, our DPP&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay is also a qualitative "yes/no" test for the detection of antibodies to HIV 1&#38; 2, delivers visual results within as little as 15 minutes, is simple to use, has a shelf life of 23 months, and does not require refrigeration. This product, which is our first FDA-approved product incorporating our patented DPP&#174; technology, can be used with oral fluid samples, as well as with all blood matrices. This product also incorporates our patent-pending oral fluid collection and storage system that enables samples to be fully extracted in buffer solution before application to the test device, and also enables the extracted sample to be stored and retested or potentially tested for multiple conditions in future product applications. Clinical and laboratory studies demonstrated the ability of the test to accurately detect the presence of antibodies in individuals down to two years of age. Studies have also shown this product to have improved performance compared with all of the current FDA-approved CLIA-waived lateral flow rapid tests, even including our own lateral flow tests. FDA-approved label claims include sensitivity/specificity on oral fluid and finger-stick whole blood of 98.9%/99.9% and 99.9%/100% respectively. Oral fluid sensitivity was 100% among HIV-positive patients not taking anti-retroviral medication.

&#160;

Regulatory Status of the DPP&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay

&#160;

In December 2012, we received FDA approval of our Pre-Marketing Approval. In October of 2014 the FDA granted CLIA-waiver status.

&#160;

The DPP&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay product is qualified for procurement under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ("PEPFAR") for use with all sample matrices, and we are pursuing WHO qualification in order to enable procurement of this product by the Global Fund and United Nations agencies, including programs underwritten by them. In October 2014, we completed a three-day on-site inspection by the WHO as follow-up to pre-qualification activities of our products with no major non-conformances noted during the audit. The WHO laboratory evaluation for the blood matrix is complete, while oral fluid is in progress and expected to be complete in 2016. In May 2015 we received approval for a CE Mark for the DPP&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay for Oral Fluid, Serum, Plasma, Fingerstick Whole Blood and Venous Whole Blood. 

&#160;

In June 2010, ANVISA approved the DPP&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay that is being marketed in Brazil through our collaboration with the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Brazil's leading public health institute (see Oswaldo Cruz Foundation OEM DPP&#174; Agreements). Since this time, we have sold and marketed millions of DPP&#174; HIV tests to Brazil through this partnership.

&#160;

DPP&#174; HIV-Syphilis Multiplex Test

&#160;

This product, launched in 2013, allows for the detection of antibodies to both HIV and Syphilis on a single test device within approximately 15 minutes. In certain global/public health settings (see Target Markets), this product may provide a more convenient and cost-effective means of rapid detecting both markers in a single test procedure at the point of care as compared with performing separate rapid tests for each indication. This product takes advantage of the multiplexing feature of DPP&#174; which provides for a more robust reaction between the sample and biomarkers being tested for (HIV and Syphilis antibodies in this case), resulting in a greater ability by the user to visually interpret test results. We launched this product in Mexico in the fourth quarter of 2013 as a unitized product, meaning that each test kit was separately packaged to include each of the other components necessary to run this test, as compared with other configurations where a test kit of 20 or 30 devices is accompanied by one bottle of running buffer. The initial results of this launch have been very positive, and we experienced good results in Mexico during 2014 from the program. Building on this initial success, we continue to pursue commercialization efforts for this product in a number of additional international markets, where there is a great need to detect Mother-to-Child-Transmission of HIV and Syphilis globally. According to the CDC website, "approximately 370,000 babies are born with HIV, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Without treatment, more than half of these children will die before the age of 2. Through key interventions, such as routinely testing pregnant women for HIV, providing antiretroviral medications to HIV-infected pregnant women and their exposed infants, and promoting safe infant feeding practices, mother-to-child transmission of HIV can be decreased from about 35% to less than 5%. Another prominent cause of infant mortality is untreated maternal syphilis, which still accounts for more than 500,000 stillbirths and infant deaths annually despite the fact that these deaths could be prevented through routine detection and treatment of syphilis during antenatal care".

&#160;

Regulatory Status of the DPP&#174; HIV-Syphilis Test

&#160;

&#160;

DPP&#174; HIV-Syphilis &#8211; We have developed this product for international and U.S. marketing. For the international market, the product has been registered in Mexico, and successfully launched and sold in this region.

&#160;

In February 2015, this product was granted approval from the Brazilian ANVISA. We have submitted this product both for evaluation by the CDC, acting on behalf of the United States Agency of International Development, and the WHO, which has accepted this product to be evaluated for pre-qualification in its global procurement scheme. In October 2014, WHO conducted a three-day audit of our facilities as follow up to pre-qualification activities for the DPP HIV-Syphilis Assay, including other products submitted for pre-qualification through WHO. No major non-conformances were identified during this audit, and we continue to work with WHO to obtain pre-qualification approval status for this device.

&#160;

We are developing a U.S. version of the DPP&#174; HIV-Syphilis Assay, designed to meet the performance requirements for the "reverse" algorithm that is currently in clinical use for syphilis testing in the United States. We have completed our pre-clinical studies for this product with encouraging results, and are in the final stages of clinical site selection for our U.S. clinical studies. We plan to begin this clinical trial in the U.S. during first quarter of 2016, and expect that the trial will be completed in six to nine months from initiation.

&#160;

DPP&#174; TECHNOLOGY &#38; DEVELOPMENT

&#160;

Chembio is executing its strategy to leverage the DPP&#174; intellectual property and product development and manufacturing experience to create new collaborations where Chembio serves as an exclusive development and manufacturing partner. Examples of such collaboration include the following:

&#160;

&#183;

&#160;

The Company entered into an agreement to develop a POC diagnostic test for dengue fever virus, the DPP&#174; Dengue Fever Assay, which would be able to detect IgG/IGM and NS1 antigens in October 2014.

&#183;

&#160;

A collaboration also announced in October 2014, with an international diagnostics company to develop a POC diagnostic test for the early detection and monitoring of a specific type of cancer. At that time, the cancer project represented the first application of the DPP&#174; technology outside the infectious disease field.

&#183;

&#160;

The Company entered into a follow-on, milestone-based development agreement with a private contracting organization acting on behalf of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for a multiplex POC influenza immunity test utilizing Chembio's patented Dual Path Platform (DPP&#174; ) technology.

&#183;

&#160;

In January 2015, Chembio entered into an agreement with the Concussion Science Group (CSG) Division of Perseus Science Group LLC, to utilize Chembio's patented DPP&#174; technology to develop a POC diagnostic test for traumatic brain injury (TBI), including sports-related concussion. Under terms of the agreement, CSG's patented biomarker will be combined with Chembio's proprietary DPP&#174; platform to develop a semi-quantitative or quantitative point-of-care test to diagnose TBI. CSG agreed to pay Chembio milestone development payments during 2015.

&#183;

&#160;

In January 2015, Chembio was awarded a grant from The Bill &#38; Melinda Gates Foundation to expedite the feasibility testing and development of a DPP&#174; Malaria POC rapid diagnostic to accurately identify individuals infected with Plasmodium falciparum parasite. Chembio's DPP&#174; technology was selected for this grant due to its exceptional sensitivity and potential to aid the foundation in its goal of eradicating malaria. To achieve this goal, diagnostics must be capable of detecting the malaria parasite in infected, but asymptomatic, people. Current POC rapid diagnostics tests lack sufficient sensitivity to identify all individuals with transmissible infections.

&#183;

&#160;

In October 2015, Chembio was awarded a grant from the Paul G. Allen Foundation to develop a POC test to identify multiple life-threatening febrile illnesses. Under the $2.1 million dollar grant, Chembio will use its patented DPP&#174; technology to develop a DPP&#174; Fever Panel Assay, a POC multiplex assay to simultaneously detect Malaria, Dengue, Ebola, Lassa and Marburg. The multiplex assay that is planned to be designed to include a quality control test band and seven tests bands with specific antibodies to detect different pathogens, including multiple serotypes of the same pathogen: Malaria PAN-PLDH antigen (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale), Malaria Falciparum HRP2 antigen, Ebola Virus PAN (Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo Virus), Marburg Virus, Lassa Virus, Dengue Virus (Dengue 1, Dengue 2, Dengue 3, Dengue 4) and Chikungunya Virus. In many parts of the world, these diseases are commonly misdiagnosed, resulting in a delay of treatment or failure to properly treat the underlying infection. Misdiagnosis may be due to the fact that these diseases have similar symptoms that are difficult to distinguish. Currently available POC diagnostics lack the ability to test for multiple diseases simultaneously. Further, existing POC diagnostics may lack the sensitivity and specificity required to detect infected but asymptomatic patients - information that is critical for preventing the spread of disease.

&#183;

&#160;

Also in October 2015, Chembio signed an agreement with opTricon (Berlin, Germany), a leading developer of mobile analysis devices for rapid diagnostic tests. Through this exclusive agreement, subject to certain terms, and covering the fields of sexually transmitted diseases, certain "fever" diseases, and a specific form of cancer, Chembio will launch the DPP&#174; Micro Reader, a point-of-care instrument designed specifically to complement Chembio's patented DPP&#174; technology as applied to those diseases. The DPP&#174; Micro Reader will include an innovative image sensor to provide a quantitative interpretation of diagnostic results when combined with Chembio's proprietary DPP&#174; immunoassay technology. Using a state-of-the-art camera system, the DPP&#174; Micro Reader is designed to provide definitive diagnostic results for low analyte concentrations, which may otherwise result in faint or ambiguous test results. In addition, the DPP&#174; Micro Reader will provide customers with various options to capture, record, transmit and store test results. With one-button operation, the palm-sized and battery-operated DPP&#174; Micro Reader is simple, fast, portable and cost-effective.

&#160;

PARTNERS INVOLVED IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS

&#160;

Alere

&#160;

On September 29, 2006, we executed marketing and license agreements with Alere. The marketing agreements (the Barrel Agreement and the Cassette Agreement) provide Alere with a 10-year exclusive right (until May 31, 2016) to market our rapid HIV tests in the United States under Alere's brands. The agreements also provide Chembio a non-exclusive license to certain Alere lateral flow patents that may be applicable to our lateral flow products, including for manufacture of the HIV tests in the United States for sales outside the United States and even for sale in the United States should Alere enter the U.S. market with a competitive rapid HIV test product and in such case we choose to market our products directly as provided in the agreements in such event of a competitive rapid HIV test product. Simultaneous with the execution of the agreements, we also settled litigation with StatSure Diagnostics, Inc. (SDS), that had been ongoing relating to the proprietary barrel device which is incorporated into one of our two FDA-approved rapid HIV tests (See Lateral Flow HIV Tests above). SDS, pursuant to the settlement, is a party to the 3-way Barrel Agreement. As a result, until now, it is through the agreements with Alere that we have been participating in the growth of the rapid HIV test market in the United States.

&#160;

In late July 2013, we received notice from Alere that it intends to commercialize its own rapid HIV test (see Competition), which test had just received FDA approval as a moderate complexity product (i.e. not CLIA-waived though this was granted in late 2014), in the United States. Under the Barrel Agreement and the Cassette Agreement such product is considered to be a Permitted Competing Product (PCP). Each of the two aforementioned agreements provides that, in the case of notice of a PCP, Chembio may make certain elections (jointly with SDS in the case of the Barrel Agreement), or elect to continue each agreement without taking any further action. Under the Cassette Agreement, Chembio may, at any time, terminate such agreement, which termination would become effective 60 days after the date notice was made. Under the Barrel Agreement, Chembio and SDS may jointly issue a non-exclusivity notice, which notice shall be effective immediately. In the event that Chembio makes this election with respect to the cassette product, or that both Chembio and SDS make this election with respect to the cassette product, then the electing party or parties could sell that respective product in the United States market under its own brand, and in such case, the lateral flow license that Chembio has from Alere for international sales would be expanded to include sales in the United States. See Lateral Flow Technology and Reagent Licenses. In April 2014, the Company gave notice to Alere of its intent to terminate the Cassette Agreement and 60 days later, the Company began marketing in the United States under the Chembio brand of HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK&#174; assay. The barrel product continues to be marketed exclusively by Alere in the U.S only, although on May 31, 2016, the Barrel Agreement will expire pursuant to its terms, and Chembio will also market the barrel product in the U.S. under the brand of SureCheck&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay.

&#160;

We have developed our own sales and marketing departments for the sales of our products in the U.S. We have appointed distributors internationally for our lateral flow HIV tests. Our largest markets outside the U.S. for our lateral flow HIV rapid tests are certain countries in Africa, Asia, and South America, as well as Mexico. Internationally, most of the demand for our products is based on governmental and non-governmental prevention and treatment efforts. Given this, these programs can and do often result in large orders, but also can result in periods of relatively lower demand, based on the variations associated with this kind of demand.

&#160;

&#160;

OEM DPP&#174; Products

&#160;

Oswaldo Cruz Foundation OEM DPP&#174; Agreements

&#160;

During 2008-2010 we signed five separate agreements, each of which is titled and constitutes a "Technology Transfer Agreement", with the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ) in Brazil. FIOCRUZ includes the Institute of Technology on Immunobiologicals/Bio- Manguinhos, which is the FIOCRUZ unit that produces vaccines and diagnostic kits. FIOCRUZ and Bio-Manguinhos are referred to herein interchangeably. Each of the five agreements relates to a different specific product or group of products based on our DPP&#174; technology. FIOCRUZ is the leading public health organization in Brazil, and it is affiliated with Brazil's Ministry of Health, which is its principal client. It has extensive research, educational and manufacturing facilities for drugs and vaccines, as well as for diagnostic products.

&#160;

Each of the agreements grants to FIOCRUZ the right, but not the obligation, to earn the right to request a technology transfer to be able to license and manufacture that product on its own. FIOCRUZ is not required to earn this right, but if it desires to do so, then it needs to purchase a stated amount of the product as set forth in the respective agreement for that product.

&#160;

During 2010 and 2011, all of the initial products contemplated under the five agreements were approved for marketing by the applicable regulatory agencies in Brazil. The agreements between the Company and FIOCRUZ are unique examples of technology transfer collaborations between a private sector rapid test manufacturer and a public health organization. The five products categories for which FIOCRUZ can earn a separate right to request a technology transfer for that product only are: DPP&#174; products for HIV screening, HIV Confirmatory, Leishmaniasis, Leptospirosis and Syphilis. Each technology transfer, and the provision by Chembio of the information and training that is required for this to occur, will occur only if FIOCRUZ purchases from Chembio the amount of that product that is specified in the respective agreement for that product. The actual amount of purchases for each product is totally at the discretion and option of FIOCRUZ and may be more or less than the amount needed to qualify for a technology transfer.

&#160;

More specifically, the five agreements, although separate and independent of one another, are structurally similar according to the following:

&#160;

&#183;

&#160;

Each agreement states: "the object of this Agreement is for the Transfer of Technology from Chembio to Bio-Manguinhos, the license by Chembio to Bio-Manguinhos for the Chembio Patents applied or granted in Brazil or other Mercosur countries for the term of the patents and the transfer of all the technical information related to the DPP&#174; technology and the process to obtain the product by the DPP&#174; technology. This Agreement contemplates the scientific and technological co-operation between Chembio and Bio-Manguinhos for such activities so that Bio-Manguinhos will be able to manufacture the Product in Brazil."

&#183;

&#160;

Each agreement provides that Chembio will supply free of charge to Bio-Manguinhos prototypes of the product to demonstrate performance characteristics that are necessary for evaluation by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and for registration with ANVISA. ANVISA is the Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria, or the National Sanitary Vigilance Agency. The number of prototypes ranges from 15,000 to 45,000 in the various agreements.

&#183;

&#160;

Each agreement provides that the prototypes will be utilized both for a performance study that follows a protocol prepared and approved by Bio-Manguinhos and the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and also will be used for studies in Brazil for the registration procedures at ANVISA. Bio-Manguinhos will then apply to ANVISA to register the product. Within 120 days of the registration of the product with ANVISA, Bio-Manguinhos will make an advance technology transfer payment to Chembio (the "Advance Payment"), in an amount specified in that particular agreement. All five of the Advance Payments provided for in the agreements were made in 2010 and 2011.

&#183;

&#160;

At such time, if any, that the product for a particular agreement has been successfully registered with ANVISA, then Bio-Manguinhos has the right to qualify for the full technology transfer for that product by purchasing the amount of the product, and at the price, specified in the agreement.

&#183;

&#160;

Bio-Manguinhos is not required to purchase any amount of any product. For each product, it only needs to purchase that product, in the amount specified in the agreement, only if it desires to be able to complete the technology transfer process in order to manufacture and sell that product on its own. Chembio does not have recourse against Bio-Manguinhos if Bio-Manguinhos does not purchase the qualifying purchase amount of any product. In that case, Chembio can only suspend further phases of the technology transfer, attempt to renegotiate the agreement, and/or retain any amounts previously paid by Bio-Manguinhos. Chembio cannot force Bio-Manguinhos to purchase any amount of any product.

&#183;

&#160;

As a result of the terms of these agreements, Bio-Manguinhos has never been required to, and is not now required to, purchase any amount of any of the products.

&#183;

As of December 31, 2015 Bio-Manguinhos had earned the status described below with respect to each of the five products:

1.

&#160;

With respect to Chembio's DPP&#174; HIV1/2 Screen test, Bio-Manguinhos had qualified to request the technology transfer. It has requested, and has received, the technology transfer information. Bio-Manguinhos purchased $880,175, $4,990,840 and $291,235 of this product in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, all of which applied to the qualifying amount to obtain the right to the technology transfer (the "Qualifying Amount") for this product. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, Bio-Manguinhos made $3,320,010, $4,799,250 and $5,410,350, respectively, of purchases in excess of the Qualifying Amount.

&#160;

2.

&#160;

With respect to Chembio's Canine Leishmania test, Bio-Manguinhos had qualified to request the technology transfer and did so request. Submission of the technology transfer information is in process at this time. Bio-Manguinhos purchased $2,000,817 and $99,183 of this product in 2011 and 2012 respectively, of this product in that applied to the Qualifying Amount. In addition, Bio-Manguinhos made purchases in excess of the Qualifying Amount equal to $1,314,117, $1,736,700, $2,394,000 and $3,772,482 in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.

&#160;

3.

&#160;

a.

&#160;

With respect to the three variations of Chembio's DPP&#174; Syphilis test, all of which are covered by a single agreement, Bio-Manguinhos had qualified to request the technology transfer with respect to Trep only, and intends to do so in the near future. Bio-Manguinhos purchased $1,194,250, $165,750 of this product in 2011 and 2012, respectively that applied to the Qualifying Amount. In addition, Bio-Manguinhos made purchases in excess of the Qualifying Amount equal to $2,817,750, $646,340, $4,617,891 and $833,631 in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.

b.

&#160;

With respect to the two variations of Chembio's Screen &#38; Confirm Test, Bio-Manguinhos had not made any purchases in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 or 2015, and therefore had not qualified to request the technology transfer for either of them. This agreement was terminated in December 2015.

c.

This syphilis agreement was terminated during the fourth quarter of 2015.

4.

&#160;

With respect to Chembio's DPP&#174; Confirmatory test, Bio-Manguinhos had not qualified to request the technology transfer. Bio-Manguinhos made purchases of $560,000, $819,000, $390,000, $390,000 and $156,000 of this product in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively, all of which applied to the Qualifying Amount. In order to qualify for the technology transfer, Bio-Manguinhos would need to purchase an additional $39,000 of this product.

5.

&#160;

With respect to Chembio's DPP&#174; Leptospirosis test, Bio-Manguinhos had not qualified to request the technology transfer. Bio-Manguinhos made purchases of $135,000 of this product in 2011, and it made -0- purchases in 2012, $45,000 in 2013 and it made -0- purchases in 2014 and -0- in 2015. In order to qualify for the technology transfer, Bio-Manguinhos would need to purchase an additional $225,000 of this product.

&#183;

&#160;

As stated above, Bio-Manguinhos is not obligated to make any purchases. After the specified level of sales for a particular product has been achieved, FIOCRUZ may request that the technology for that product be transferred to FIOCRUZ together with an exclusive license to produce and sell that product in a defined territory. The license is to provide that Chembio will receive a royalty on all sales. Chembio does not release the amount of this royalty because it could have an adverse effect on negotiations concerning royalties in potential transactions with other parties.

&#183;

&#160;

All the agreements expire five years after the date of the technology transfer. If terminated earlier by default of FIOCRUZ, FIOCRUZ must stop all activity; if terminated earlier by default of Chembio, or if terminated by natural expiry, FIOCRUZ can continue to produce and commercialize the product without paying royalties.

Other OEM And License Agreements Related to DPP&#174; Technology

&#160;

In addition to our agreements with FIOCRUZ, we have entered into certain OEM and license agreements with other parties with respect to certain products that we have developed based on our DPP&#174; technology. In 2008 we entered into a product development and license agreement with Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (Bio-Rad), a leading multinational life sciences company, for the first ever POC test for the confirmation of HIV (reflex test used after initial screening test(s) are positive). This product utilizes our DPP&#174; technology, capitalizing on its multiplexing advantages, and is much simpler to perform than the legacy confirmatory platform, known as western blot, which requires a substantial amount of technical training and hands-on time and which is more expensive to manufacture and distribute. This product was CE marked and was launched by Bio-Rad in the second quarter of 2013 in Europe under their Geenius&#174; brand; and an FDA PMA approval was received in 2014.

&#160;

In 2013 we entered into collaboration with Labtest, a private company in Brazil, for the distribution of a number of products in Brazil that would be co-branded with Labtest and Chembio trademarks. Under this agreement, upon request from Labtest, for which there is no requirement, Chembio will sell the appropriate DPP&#174; components to Labtest for further manufacture and assembly in Brazil.

&#160;

In February 2014, Chembio entered into a technology transfer and license agreement with RVR Diagnostics SDN BHD ("RVR"), a privately-held company in Malaysia. The agreement supports Chembio's strategy of establishing a market presence in Asia, in collaboration with RVR as a licensee, distributor, and contract manufacturer, depending on the circumstances. The agreements grant exclusive distribution rights to RVR in certain countries in the region and enable RVR to manufacture Chembio's DPP&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay and DPP&#174; HIV-Syphilis Assay, and potentially other products developed by Chembio, such as Dengue, incorporating its patented DPP&#174; technology as indicated in the DPP&#174; Technology &#38; Development section above.

&#160;

Our Rapid Test Technologies

&#160;

All of our commercially available current products employ either in-licensed lateral flow technology or our own patented Dual Path Platform (DPP&#174;) technology. Both lateral flow technology and DPP&#174; allow the development of accurate, low cost, easy-to-perform, single-use diagnostic tests for rapid, visual detection of specific antigen-antibody complexes on a test strip. These formats provide a test that is simple (requires neither electricity nor expensive equipment for test execution or reading, nor skilled personnel for test interpretation), rapid (turnaround time approximately 15 minutes), safe (minimizes handling of potentially infected specimens), non-invasive (requires 5-20 micro liters of whole blood easily obtained with a finger prick, or alternatively, serum or plasma), stable (24 months at room temperature storage in the case of our HIV tests), and highly reproducible.

&#160;

We believe that products developed using DPP&#174; technology can provide superior diagnostic performance as compared with products that use lateral flow technology. The reason for this is that one of the major differences between the two platforms is that in DPP&#174; samples are allowed to incubate with the target analyte in the test zone before introduction of the labeling reagent/conjugate, whereas in lateral flow, samples are combined with the labeling reagent to form a complex before coming in contact with the target analyte. We believe that this complex can compromise test performance. Also, because of the usage in DPP&#174; of a separately connected sample strip, the control and delivery of sample material is substantially improved. This feature is critical in the development of multiplex tests, as well as tests that involve viscous sample material (such as oral fluid) that can be impeded when forced to combine with labeling reagents before migration on the test strip to the test zone area.

&#160;

Multiplexing is significantly improved as a result of the design of DPP&#174; and this provides a significant advantage. For example, the HIV confirmatory test we developed for Bio-Rad that is described above employs six different markers related to various epitopes of the HIV antigen. We have a number of other products in development, including those being developed in sponsored development programs that involve the use of multiple (e.g. eight) test bands. Although all of these products could be visually read, we can also use handheld and desktop readers with our DPP&#174; products to objectively measure, quantify, record and report DPP&#174; test results. Certain of the products we have and/or are developing incorporate some of these readers, and we are developing other products that may be used with or will require use of a reader. Also, platforms can incorporate labeling reagents that cannot be visually read except by employing a reader, such as fluorescence, though no products are currently utilizing such reagents.

&#160;

We are pursuing additional capabilities and technologies that will complement our current product portfolio and business strategy. This activity includes pursing development, license or acquisition of diagnostic technologies that complement our existing platforms, proprietary biomarkers that can result in new product applications of our existing platforms, and new platforms that would complement our commercial strategy.

&#160;

Target Markets

&#160;

Rapid HIV Tests

&#160;

A large percentage of individuals that are HIV positive worldwide are unaware of their status. Part of the reason for this is that even those that do get tested in public health settings will often not return or call back for their test results when samples have to be sent out to a laboratory which can take up to several days to process. The increased availability, greater efficacy and reduced costs for anti-retroviral treatments (ARVs) for HIV has increased the demand for testing, as the stigma associated with the disease is lessened, and the ability to resume normal activities is substantially improved, providing a positive message to those potentially infected. The impact that rapid HIV testing has had on prevention efforts has in turn increased the demand for testing, particularly by public health programs worldwide, which have also become more effective in reducing the number of annual new infections in many, but by no means all, high prevalence regions.

&#160;

Despite less attention to HIV by the media as compared with prior years, there are still approximately 50,000 new diagnoses of HIV infection in the United States each year, according to the CDC. CDC estimates that approximately 1.1 million individuals in the U.S. are living with HIV, with an estimated 1 of 8 of these U.S. individuals, or almost 13%, unaware that they are infected. It is transmissions from these infected people that are reported to account for the majority of all new infections per year. Part of the reason for this is that even those individuals that do get tested in public health settings will often not return or call back for their test results if their blood samples have to be sent out to and tested in a laboratory and then reported back, a process which can take up to several days to complete. Making more people aware of their HIV status at the point-of-care reduces the number of HIV transmissions.

&#160;

Rapid HIV testing in the United States has now developed into an estimated 7.5 million test market at an average price of $10, or a total of $75 million. Public health programs, currently funded by grants distributed to states by the CDC, account for an estimated 45% of the market, with hospitals (40%) and doctor ' s offices (15%) comprising the other estimated market segments. Chembio ' s rapid HIV tests represent approximately a 20% share of this market. OraSure Technologies, Inc., which was the first FDA-approved rapid HIV test, maintains approximately 50% of this market. Trinity Biotech has an estimated 15% market share and Alere, Biolytical Laboratories, Medmira and Bio-Rad share the remaining 10%.

&#160;

In 2006, the outlook for HIV testing was given a big boost with the release by the CDC of new recommendations for HIV testing. These new CDC recommendations were/are that an HIV test should be given as a routine test like any other for all patients between 13 and 64 years of age, regardless of risk, with an opt-out screening option and focused testing procedural (pre- and post-test counseling) guidelines. Though not mandatory, gradual adoption in whole or in part of the 2006 CDC recommendations by a number of states continues to have an increasing impact. Finally, in 2013, the United States Preventive Services Task Force ( " USPSTF " ) fully embraced these CDC routine HIV testing recommendations. This USPSTF recommendation, which was given an A grade under their recommendation grading system based on the benefits of this practice and the nearly 600,000 AIDS-related deaths in the United States, requires insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act (the " ACA " ) as a preventive screening test without any co-payment required. We expect this to result in an increase in HIV testing in the United States in the coming years, which we believe will include point-of-care HIV testing utilizing the Company ' s products. Although as stated above, currently most public health testing in the United States is funded by grants allocated to high prevalence areas by the CDC, we believe this will shift to an insurance-funded model under the ACA in the years to come, increasing the amount of testing done in doctor ' s offices and community health centers.

&#160;

In the international market, we sell our products directly and through distributors to large screening programs overseen by ministries of health and NGOs, most but not all of which are funded by large bi-lateral and multi-lateral AIDS relief programs, the largest of which is the U.S. President ' s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Established by President George Bush as a 5-year $15 billion program in 2003, PEPFAR was reauthorized in 2008 and again in 2013. In 2012 PEPFAR directly supported HIV testing and counseling for more than 11 million pregnant women, and testing and counseling for more than 49 million people overall. The U.S. is also the first and largest donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. To date, the U.S. has provided more than $7 billion to the Fund.

&#160;

In December 2013 President Obama signed into law the PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Act, which is the most recent reauthorization of PEPFAR. However, unlike the 2008 PEPFAR authorization, which authorized approximately $45 billion, the new law doesn ' t authorize a specific dollar amount for funding. Nevertheless it is widely anticipated that PEPFAR will continue to enjoy strong funding; the FY14 budget had $6 billion for global HIV/AIDS assistance, including $4 billion for PEPFAR.

&#160;

Chembio, with its four U.S.-manufactured rapid HIV tests, all of which are FDA-approved, is recognized as a reputable and dependable supplier of high quality products that are available at reasonably competitive prices. As a result, certain of our products have been selected in the testing protocols in countries (national algorithms) that are large beneficiaries of PEPFAR and the Global Fund. As mentioned above, these programs can and do often result in large orders, but also can result in periods of relatively lower demand, based on the variations associated with this kind of demand. Also, even though the United States taxpayer is funding the largest share of global AIDS relief, U.S. companies do not receive any preference for these procurements, and therefore must compete with foreign suppliers that manufacture competitive products with lower costs, including those related to quality, regulatory, intellectual property, and costs of manufacturing.

&#160;

Oral fluid testing is an established alternative to blood testing for diagnostic tests, including HIV tests. It is also often patient preferred, providing a more comfortable, less invasive test. In certain public health clinics, staffs choose not to handle blood specimens; thus, oral sample collection provides a viable alternative. The most well-established market for oral fluid HIV testing is the United States. Given the premium price required for an oral fluid test as compared with blood tests, the higher volume programs will not specify an oral fluid test. However, segments of these programs may want to have an oral fluid testing option, and certain programs that have greater resources may also choose to incorporate oral fluid testing into the testing protocol.

&#160;

There is also now an over-the-counter market for HIV self-testing in the United States. OraSure Technologies Inc. received FDA approval for an over-the-counter (self-testing) version of its previously professional-market-approved (test performed on an individual by a health care professional) HIV test. The FDA approval was granted in July 2012, and OraSure has been investing heavily in developing this market. Initial results after over two years of marketing are well below expectations. The costs for such over-the-counter approval, including primarily the associated clinical trials, are estimated to be at least $5 million and they may take two to three years to complete, not to mention the cost of distribution. OraSure ' s initial results are not convincing of a large market, although this possibility remains. If it appears that there is an attractive market, we believe we are very well positioned to participate in this market.

&#160;

Rapid HIV-Syphilis Test

&#160;

There are significant risks relating to transmission of Syphilis from a pregnant mother to child, just as there are for transmission of HIV. Therefore we believe there is a significant opportunity to improve prevention efforts in pregnant mother to child transmission testing programs (PMTCT) that are currently not doing any or nearly enough testing for syphilis even though they are testing for HIV. In the United States, we believe there is also a significant need for this product in some of the highest HIV prevalence populations, such as among men that have sex with men (MSM), as data show high degrees of HIV and Syphilis co-infection in this segment of the population.

&#160;

Marketing Strategy

&#160;

Our marketing strategy is to:

&#160;

&#183;

&#160;

Market our DPP&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay, HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK&#174; Assay and future DPP&#174; based new products in the US through our internal sales and marketing organization and selected channel partners (e.g., McKesson/PSS, Fisher Healthcare, Henry Schein, etc.). Chembio, following the June 2014 termination of the STAT-PAK&#174; agreement with Alere, does not have to share any portion of the net sales proceeds for STAT-PAK&#174; with Alere. This decision resulted in incurring expenditures related to hiring sales representatives, establishing agreements and associated discounts with distributors, incurring advertising and marketing expenditures, warehousing, customer service and technical support. If Alere's new competitive product is indeed successful, our ability to retain a significant share of the market that has been established for our products may be enhanced by our having control of the marketing of our products, rather than relying on Alere to sell both our products while it is also selling its own competing product. We are leveraging the same sales force for U.S. Sales of DPP&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay.

&#183;

We will support, review and assess the marketing and distribution efforts of our rapid HIV barrel test in the U.S.

&#183;

Outside the U.S., we will market our products primarily through commercial collaborators and distribution partners.

&#183;

&#160;

Leverage our DPP&#174; intellectual property and product development and manufacturing experience to continue creating new collaborations where Chembio can be the exclusive development and manufacturing partner supporting leading marketing organizations.

&#183;

&#160;

Establish strong distribution relationships for our Chembio-branded products in the U.S and abroad, and establish a direct sales and marketing organization that is focused in the public health market segment, and that utilizes distributors for other market segments, primarily the acute care market which, together with public health, are the main market segments for rapid HIV tests in the United States. We believe that creation of a Chembio public health brand and marketing organization is fundamental to the creation of shareholder value over the long-term.

We have increased our commercial activities and efforts in Africa, Europe and Asia for our HIV tests and product pipeline. We believe these efforts will enable us to be more closely engaged with opportunities to engage with customers and partners and to participate in the national testing algorithms that are established and revised from time to time by countries that are beneficiaries of PEPFAR, Global Fund and/or other bilateral or multilateral donor funding. In Europe, where there are a larger percentage of HIV positive people unaware of their status than in the United States, we believe that there is an emerging public health outreach opportunity, and there are relatively few strong competitors that are CE-marked. Most recently we have established new sales and marketing positions in the Company to support our efforts to increase brand awareness globally and to lead our direct sales effort in the U.S. market.

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

The diagnostics industry is a multi-billion dollar international industry and is intensely competitive. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial, research, manufacturing and marketing resources. Industry competition in general is based on the following:

&#160;

&#183;

Scientific and technological capability;

&#183;

Proprietary know-how;

&#183;

The ability to develop and market products and processes;

&#183;

The ability to obtain FDA or other required regulatory approvals;

&#183;

&#160;

The ability to manufacture products that meet applicable FDA requirements, (i.e. FDA ' s Quality System Regulations) (see Governmental Regulation section);

&#183;

The ability to manufacture products cost-effectively;

&#183;

Access to adequate capital;

&#183;

The ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and

&#183;

The availability of patent protection.

We believe our scientific and technological capabilities and our proprietary know-how relating to our in-licensed lateral flow technology rapid tests and to our proprietary know-how related to our patented DPP&#174; technology, particularly for the development and manufacture of tests for the detection of antibodies to infectious diseases such as HIV, are very strong.

&#160;

Our ability to develop and market other products is in large measure dependent on our having additional resources and/or collaborative relationships. Some of our product development efforts have been funded on a project or milestone basis. We believe that our proprietary know-how in lateral flow technology and in our DPP&#174; technology has been instrumental in our obtaining the collaborations we have and that we continue to pursue. We believe that the patent protection that we have with our DPP&#174; technology enhances our ability to develop more profitable collaborative relationships and to license out the technology. However there are a number of competitive technologies used and/or seeking to be used in point-of-care settings. These technologies may be based on immunoassay principles such as the Company ' s products or other technologies, such as molecular-based technologies.

&#160;

We launched our FDA-approved DPP&#174; HIV 1/2 Assay, which test also can be used with either oral fluid or blood samples, in the U.S. market under a Chembio brand in the fourth quarter of 2014. OraSure Technologies manufactures the only other rapid, oral fluid HIV test that is FDA-approved, and OraSure has enjoyed this position for approximately 10 years. OraSure has lost a significant share of this market as certain customers have been indifferent to using blood or oral fluid samples, because the blood tests, including those made/marketed by Chembio and marketed by Alere, are priced lower and/or are as or more accurate than the performance of OraSure ' s product on blood samples. OraSure has primarily retained those customers for whom the oral fluid sample feature is a strong preference, and this is an estimated $35 million business for OraSure. Although we believe we can capture a meaningful portion of this OraSure market share, we also anticipate that OraSure will defend this business aggressively.

&#160;

In 2006 Alere acquired a division from Abbott Diagnostic located in Japan that manufactured and marketed a rapid HIV test product line called Determine&#174;. The Determine&#174; format was developed for the developing world and remote settings and, central to the needs of that market, the format is essentially a test strip that is integrated into a thin foil wrapper that, when opened, the underside of the wrapper serves as the test surface for applying the blood sample and performing the test. This design reduces costs and shipping weights and volumes and is an advantage for the developing world markets it has served. Some of the disadvantages of the platform are the amount of blood sample that is needed (50 microliters versus 2.5, 5 and 10 for our lateral flow barrel, lateral flow cassette, and DPP&#174; products respectively), the open nature of the test surface, and the absence of a true control that differentiates biological from other kinds of samples.

&#160;

The so-called " 3rd generation " version of this product has been marketed for many years and is the leading rapid HIV test that is used in a large majority of the national algorithms of countries funded by PEPFAR and the Global Fund, as well as many other countries in the world. That product is not FDA-approved though it is CE-marked. The newest Determine&#174; HIV version, which was developed and manufactured at Alere ' s subsidiary in Israel, Orgenics, is the so-called " 4th Generation " version Determine&#174; test. According to its claims, this product detects HIV antibodies and P24 HIV antigens. Since the P24 antigen is known to occur in HIV-positive individuals ' blood samples before antibodies do, based on its performance claims, the 4th generation Determine&#174; test is therefore able to detect HIV infection earlier than tests that solely rely on antibody detection. Chembio ' s tests, as well as all of the other currently FDA-approved rapid HIV tests, only detect antibodies. There are however laboratory tests that are FDA-approved that are " 4th generation " tests, but they are of course neither rapid nor point-of-care.

&#160;

The initial " 4th generation " Alere Determine&#174; rapid test product that was also CE-marked and that Alere launched internationally some years ago has not been successfully commercialized to the best of our knowledge and at least certain published studies were not favorable for this product. However the 4th generation product that is now FDA-approved was apparently modified as compared to the initial international version of it, and it may perform more satisfactorily. Alere received FDA approval of this modified product in August 2013 and CLIA-waiver for it in the fourth quarter of 2014. There is support by a number of key opinion leaders for the public health value of such 4th generation tests, and it represents a significant competitive threat to Chembio as well as to each of the other rapid HIV test manufacturers (OraSure and Trinity primarily).

&#160;

During 2011 Biolytical, Inc. of Vancouver, Canada received FDA approval and in 2012 received CLIA waiver of a flow-through rapid HIV test called " INSTI " . The technology used in the INSTI test, flow-through, is older than lateral flow, and it requires handling of multiple components (3 vials of solution) to perform the test in multiple steps. However, these steps can be accomplished in less than ten minutes, and the actual test results occur in only one minute after those steps are completed. Therefore sample-to-result time is shorter than any of the competitive products. There are settings where that reduced total test time, despite the multiple steps required, may be a distinct advantage, and we believe Biolytical has made some progress in penetrating certain public health markets.

&#160;

Although we have no specific knowledge of any other competitors ' products that are a competitive threat to our products, or that will render our products obsolete, if we fail to maintain and enhance our competitive position or fail to introduce new products and product features, our customers may decide to use the products developed by our competitors, which could result in a loss of revenues and cash flow.

&#160;

Research and Development

&#160;

During 2015 and 2014, we spent $6.4 million and $4.8 million, respectively, on research and development (including regulatory activities). These expenses were in part underwritten by funding from R&#38;D and milestones revenues of $2.3 million in 2015 and $1.7 million in 2014. All of our new product development activities involve employment of our DPP&#174; technology. These activities include completing development of certain products and making significant progress toward the development of additional products.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, we employed approximately155 people. We have entered into employment contracts with our Chief Executive Officer and President, John J. Sperzel, our Chief Operating Officer, Sharon Klugewicz, and our Chief Science and Technology Officer, Javan Esfandiari. Due to the specific knowledge and experience of these executives regarding the industry, technology and market, the loss of the services of any one of them would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company. The contract with Ms. Klugewicz, has a term of two years ending May 2017. The contract with Mr. Esfandiari has a term of three years ending March 2016. The Company and Mr. Esfandiari currently are discussing terms for renewal of his employment agreement. We have obtained a key man insurance policy for Mr. Esfandiari. The contract with Mr. Sperzel provides that Mr. Sperzel will serve as the Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company through March 2017.

&#160;

Governmental Regulation 

&#160;

The manufacturing and marketing of the Company ' s existing and proposed diagnostic products are regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration ( " FDA " ), United States Department of Agriculture ( " USDA " ), certain state and local agencies, and/or comparable regulatory bodies in other countries. These regulations govern almost all aspects of development, production and marketing, including product testing, authorizations to market, labeling, promotion, manufacturing and record keeping. The Company ' s FDA and USDA regulated products require some form of action by each agency before they can be marketed in the United States, and, after approval or clearance, the Company must continue to comply with other FDA requirements applicable to marketed products, e.g. Quality Systems (for medical devices). Failure to comply with the FDA ' s requirements can lead to significant penalties, both before and after approval or clearance.

&#160;

There are two review procedures by which medical devices can receive FDA clearance or approval. Some products may qualify for clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, in which the manufacturer provides a pre-market notification that it intends to begin marketing the product, and shows that the product is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed product (i.e., that it has the same intended use and is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness). In some cases, the submission must include data from human clinical studies. Marketing may commence when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding such substantial equivalence. FDA clearance of our DPP&#174; Syphilis Screen &#38; Confirm test will be by means of a 510(k) submission.

&#160;

If the medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) procedure (either because it is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device or because it is required by statute and the FDA ' s implementing regulations have an approved application), the FDA must approve a Pre-Marketing Application ( " PMA " ) before marketing can begin. PMA ' s must demonstrate, among other matters, that the medical device provides a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. A PMA application is typically a complex submission, including the results of non-clinical and clinical studies. Preparing a PMA application is a much more expensive, detailed and time-consuming process as compared with a 510(K) pre-market notification. The Company has approved PMAs for the two rapid HIV tests now marketed in the U.S.: both our HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK&#174; and also our test that currently is marketed in the U.S. by Alere Medical as Clearview&#174; Complete HIV 1/2 and Clearview&#174; HIV 1/2 STAT PAK&#174;.

&#160;

FDA approval of our DPP&#174; HIV screening assay for use with oral fluid or blood samples also was achieved by means of a PMA application. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988 ( " CLIA " ) prohibits laboratories from performing in-vitro tests for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of any disease or impairment of, or the assessment of, the health of human beings unless there is in effect for such laboratories a certificate issued by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (via the FDA) applicable to the category of examination or procedure performed. Although a certificate is not required for the Company, it considers the applicability of the requirements of CLIA in the design and development of its products. The statutory definition of " laboratory " is very broad, and many of our customers are considered labs. A CLIA waiver will remove certain quality control and other requirements that must be met for certain customers to use the Company ' s products and this is critical to the marketability of a product into the point-of-care diagnostics market. The Company has received a CLIA waiver for each of the two lateral flow rapid HIV tests now marketed in the U.S. The CLIA waiver was granted by the FDA for HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK&#174; on November 20, 2006 and for the Clearview&#174; Complete HIV 1/2 on October 22, 2007. In 2008 the FDA revised its CLIA waiver requirements so that an additional prospective trial need be conducted in order to demonstrate clinical utility by showing that the device is capable of identifying new infections when used by untrained users. Our DPP&#174; HIV 1/2 test received CLIA waiver in October of 2014.

&#160;

In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices that have not been approved for marketing in the United States. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act contains general requirements for any medical device that may not be sold in the United States and is intended for export. Specifically, a medical device intended for export is not deemed to be adulterated or misbranded if the product: (1) complies with the specifications of the foreign purchaser; (2) is not in conflict with the laws of the country to which it is intended for export; (3) is prominently labeled on the outside of the shipping package that it is intended for export; and (4) is not sold or offered for sale in the United States. However, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act does permit the export of devices to any country in the world, if the device complies with the laws of the importing country and has valid marketing authorization in one of several " listed " countries under the theory that these listed countries have sophisticated mechanisms for the review of medical devices for safety and effectiveness.

&#160;

The Company is also subject to regulations in foreign countries governing products, human clinical trials and marketing, and may need to obtain approval or evaluations by international public health agencies, such as the World Health Organization, in order to sell diagnostic products in certain countries. Approval processes vary from country to country, and the length of time required for approval or to obtain other clearances may in some cases be longer than that required for United States governmental approvals. On the other hand, the fact that our HIV diagnostic tests are of value in the AIDS epidemic may lead to some government process being expedited. The extent of potentially adverse governmental regulation affecting Chembio that might arise from future legislative or administrative action cannot be predicted.

&#160;

Environmental Laws

&#160;

To date, we have not encountered any costs relating to compliance with any environmental laws.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Intellectual Property Strategy

&#160;

Our intellectual property strategy is to: (1) build our own intellectual property portfolio around our DPP&#174; technology; (2) pursue licenses, trade secrets and know-how within the area of rapid point-of-care testing, and (3) develop and acquire proprietary positions to reagents and new hardware platforms for the development and manufacture of rapid diagnostic tests.

&#160;

The Company has obtained patent coverage on the DPP&#174; technology, including four U.S. patents, and patents in China, Malaysia, Eurasia, Mexico, Singapore, Japan, Australia, Indonesia, Korea and the U.K. Additional patent applications on the DPP&#174; technology are pending in the U.S., as well as in many foreign countries such as Brazil, Canada, the European Union, India, Israel, and South Africa. Patents have also been filed on extensions to the DPP&#174; product line concept, such as 4th generation assays. The four U.S. patents are as follows:

The Company has also filed for patents and obtained some patents in the U.S. for other inventions, such as its multiple host species veterinary TB test, and patent applications for the other inventions are in various stages from being recently filed and not yet examined, to already examined and allowed but not yet issued. The Company selectively and strategically foreign files its patent applications based on a number of economic and strategic factors related to the invention.

&#160;

Trademarks

&#160;

The Company has filed and obtained trademarks for its products, including DPP&#174;, SURE CHECK&#174; and STAT-PAK&#174;, and also for the SampleTainer&#174; used in certain DPP&#174; products. The DPP&#174; trademark is also registered under the European convention (ECT). The Company recently filed a trademark for STAT-VIEW&#174;, to market the barrel product in Europe.

&#160;

Trade Secrets and Know-How

&#160;

We believe that we have developed a substantial body of trade secrets and know-how relating to the development and manufacture of lateral flow and DPP&#174;-based diagnostic tests, including but not limited to the sourcing and optimization of materials for such tests, and how to maximize sensitivity, speed-to-result, specificity, stability and reproducibility. The Company possesses proprietary know-how to develop tests for multiple conditions using colored latex. Our buffer formulations enable extremely long shelf lives of our rapid HIV and other tests and we believe that this provides us with an important competitive advantage.

&#160;

Lateral Flow Technology and Reagent Licenses

&#160;

As part of the agreements executed in 2006 with Alere for the marketing of our HIV tests, we were granted non-exclusive licenses to certain lateral flow patents for certain products manufactured and marketed by Chembio including but not limited to our lateral flow HIV tests. This license allows us to produce, market and sell assays using lateral flow technologies specifically including our STAT-PAK&#174;, SURE CHECK&#174;, DIPSTICK&#174;, and veterinary product lines. Under this license agreement, prior to February 3, 2015, we paid royalties to Alere ranging from 5% to 8&#189;%, depending upon the country in which the products are sold. Even though the relevant patent has expired in most other jurisdictions, or were never issued in markets where we have sold these products, our manufacture of the products in the United States has required that we pay royalties under this license, which has been a substantial expense. In 2015 our lateral flow royalty expense to Alere was $30,000, and since 2007 we have incurred a total of $2.87 million in lateral flow royalty expenses. As of February 3, 2015 this royalty expense was no longer payable as the applicable patent expired at that time.

&#160;

Although we believe our DPP&#174; is outside of the scope of all lateral flow patents of which we are aware, we consult with patent counsel, and seek licenses and/or redesigns of products that we believe to be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. Because of the costs and other negative consequences of time-consuming patent litigation, we often attempt to obtain a license on reasonable terms. Nevertheless there is no assurance that the Alere lateral flow patents we have licensed will not be challenged or that other patents containing claims relevant to the Company's lateral flow or DPP&#174; products will not be granted to third parties and that licenses to such patents, will be available on reasonable terms, if any. In the past Alere has aggressively enforced its lateral flow intellectual property, although some of the main patents have expired and we are not aware of any patent enforcement litigation that is ongoing with respect to the Alere lateral flow intellectual property.

&#160;

Regardless, the DPP&#174; technology provides us with our own intellectual property. We believe it provides us with a freedom to operate, and that it also enables tests to be developed with improved sensitivity as compared with comparable tests on lateral flow platforms. The Company has signed and anticipates signing new development projects based upon the DPP&#174; technology that will provide new manufacturing and marketing opportunities. We have filed other patent applications that we believe will strengthen the DPP&#174; intellectual property and have also filed for patent protection for certain other point-of-care technologies or applications thereof.

&#160;

The peptides used in our rapid HIV tests were patented by Adaltis Inc. and were licensed to us under a 10-year non-exclusive license agreement dated August 30, 2002. However, in connection with Adaltis' bankruptcy, during the third quarter of 2009 we bought out all of our remaining obligations under that agreement. We also have licensed the antigens used in other tests including our Syphilis, Tuberculosis, Leptospirosis, Leishmaniasis and Chagas tests, and we may enter other license agreements. In prior years we concluded license agreements related to intellectual property rights owned by the United States associated with HIV- 1, and during the first quarter of 2008 we entered into a sub-license agreement for HIV-2 with Bio-Rad Laboratories N.A., the exclusive licensee of the Pasteur Institute's HIV-2 intellectual property estate.

&#160;

Corporate History

&#160;

On May 5, 2004, we completed a merger with Trading Solutions, Inc. through which Chembio Diagnostic Systems Inc. became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and through which the management and business of Chembio Diagnostic Systems Inc. became our management and business. As part of this transaction, we changed our name to Chembio Diagnostics, Inc. In 2003, we had sold our prior business, and as a result, we had no specific business immediately prior to the merger.

&#160;

Since the formation of Chembio Diagnostic Systems Inc. in 1985, it has been involved in developing, manufacturing, selling and distributing in-vitro diagnostic tests, including rapid tests beginning in 1995, for a number of conditions in humans and animals.

&#160;

On March 12, 2004, we implemented a 1-for-17 reverse split of our common stock. All references herein to shares of our common stock have been adjusted to reflect this reverse split.

&#160;

On May 30, 2012, the Company effected a 1-for-8 reverse split of its common stock. This was done to allow the Company to move to the NASDAQ trading market from the OTCQB market, which occurred on June 7, 2012. As a result of the stock split, the outstanding 63,967,263 common shares were reduced to 7,995,918 outstanding common shares on May 30, 2012. The effect of this reverse stock split also has been retroactively reflected for all periods in these financial statements.

&#160;

Stockholder Rights Agreement

On March 8, 2016, the Company entered into a Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") between the Company and Action Stock Transfer Corp., as Rights Agent. Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, the Company declared a dividend distribution of one Preferred Share Purchase Right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 (the "Common Stock"), of the Company, in the manner described below. The Board of Directors set the payment date for the distribution of the Rights as March 8, 2016, and the Rights were distributed to the Company's shareholders of record on that date. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement.

&#160;

Rights Initially Not Exercisable. The Rights are not exercisable until a Distribution Date. Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, has no rights as a shareholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.

&#160;

Separation and Distribution of Rights . The Rights are to be evidenced by the certificates for shares of Common Stock registered in the names of the holders thereof, and not by separate rights certificates until the earlier to occur of (i) the close of business on the tenth business day following a public announcement that an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) has acquired a Combined Ownership (as defined in the Rights Agreement) of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock (the "Shares Acquisition Date") or (ii) the later of (A) the close of business on the tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to such time as any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person) after the date that a tender or exchange offer or intention to commence a tender or exchange offer by any person is first published, announced, sent or given within the meaning of Rule 14d-4(A) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the consummation of which would result in any person having Combined Ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock, or (B) if such a tender or exchange offer has been published, announced, sent or given before the date of the Rights Agreement, then the close of business on the tenth business day after the date the Rights Agreement was entered into (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to such time as any person becomes an Acquiring Person); (the earlier of such dates referred to in (i) and (ii), which date may include any such date that is after the date of the Rights Agreement but prior to the issuance of the Rights, being called the "Distribution Date").

Glossary 

&#160;

AIDS

Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. AIDS is caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, HIV.

ALGORITHM (parallel or serial)

For rapid HIV testing this refers both to method or protocol (in developing countries to date) for using rapid tests from different manufacturers in combination to screen and confirm patients at the point-of-care, and may also refer to the specific tests that have been selected by an agency or ministry of health to be used in this way. A parallel algorithm uses two screening tests from different manufacturers and a tie-breaker test only if there is a discrepancy between the screening tests results. A serial algorithm only uses a second confirmatory test if there is a positive result from the screening test, meaning that the number of confirmatory tests used is equal to the positivity rate in the testing venue. A tie-breaker test resolves discrepancies between the screen and the confirmatory test.

ANTIBODY

A protein which is a natural part of the human immune system produced by specialized cells to neutralize antigens, including viruses and bacteria that invade the body. Each antibody producing cell manufactures a unique antibody that is directed against, binds to and eliminates one, and only one, specific type of antigen.

ANTIGEN

Any substance which, upon entering the body, stimulates the immune system leading to the formation of antibodies. Among the more common antigens are bacteria, pollens, toxins, and viruses.

ANVISA

The National Health Surveillance Agency of Brazil

ARVs

Anti-retroviral medications developed to fight AIDS

CDC

United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

CLIA waiver

Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act designation that allows simple tests to be performed in point-of-care settings such as doctor's offices, walk-in clinics and emergency rooms.

DIAGNOSTIC

Pertaining to the determination of the nature or cause of a disease or condition. Also refers to reagents or procedures used in diagnosis to measure proteins in a clinical sample.

FIOCRUZ

The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation of Brazil

FDA
