We have four founder-inspired concepts: Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba&#8217;s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and Fleming&#8217;s Prime Steakhouse &#38; Wine Bar. Our restaurant concepts range in price point and degree of formality from casual (Outback Steakhouse and Carrabba&#8217;s Italian Grill) to upscale casual (Bonefish Grill) and fine dining (Fleming&#8217;s Prime Steakhouse &#38; Wine Bar). During 2015, we sold our Roy&#8217;s concept.

Our predecessor opened the first Outback Steakhouse restaurant in 1988. In 1996, we expanded the Outback Steakhouse concept internationally. OSI Restaurant Partners, LLC (&#8220;OSI&#8221;) is our primary operating entity. New Private Restaurant Properties, LLC (&#8220;PRP&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bloomin&#8217; Brands, leases our owned restaurant properties primarily to OSI subsidiaries. 

Financial Information About Segments &#32;- During the first quarter of 2015, we recast our segment reporting to include two &#32;reportable segments, U.S. and International, which reflects changes made in how we manage our business, review operating performance and allocate resources. The U.S. segment includes all brands operating in the U.S. and brands operating outside the U.S. are included in the International segment. All prior period information was recast to reflect this change. Following is a summary of reporting segments as of December 27, 2015 :

On January 26, 2015, we sold our Roy&#8217;s concept. &#32; 

(2) 

The restaurant counts for Brazil are reported as of November 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, to correspond with the balance sheet dates of this subsidiary.

In the first quarter of 2015, we adopted a policy that relocated international restaurants closed more than 30 days and relocated U.S. restaurants closed more than 60 days are considered a closure. Prior periods for South Korea have been revised to conform to the current year presentation. 

BLOOMIN&#8217; BRANDS, INC. 

RESTAURANT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT 

Site Design - We generally construct freestanding buildings on leased properties, although certain leased sites are also located in strip shopping centers. Construction of a new restaurant typically takes 60 to 180 days from the date the location is leased or under contract and fully permitted. In the majority of cases, future restaurant development will result from the lease of existing third-party retail space. We typically design the interior of our restaurants in-house, utilizing outside architects when necessary. 

Remodel and Relocation Plans - We have an ongoing program across all of our concepts to maintain the relevance of our restaurants&#8217; ambience. We also have an ongoing relocation plan, primarily related to the Outback Steakhouse brand. This multi-year relocation plan is focused on driving additional traffic to our restaurants by moving legacy restaurants from non-prime to prime locations within the same trade area. 

Site Selection Process - We have a central site selection team comprised of real estate development, property/lease management and design and construction personnel. This site selection team also utilizes a combination of existing field operations managers, internal development personnel and outside real estate brokers to identify and qualify potential sites. 

Restaurant Development 

We utilize the ownership structure and market entry strategy that best fits the needs for a particular market, including Company-owned units, joint ventures and franchises. For each market, we determine whether we will focus on Company-owned units, joint ventures or franchises based on demand, cost structure and economic conditions. 

U.S. Development - We plan to opportunistically pursue unit growth in Outback Steakhouse locations through existing geography fill-in and market expansion opportunities based on their current location mix. We believe we have the potential to relocate or add 50 Outback Steakhouse units over the next three years and increase Fleming&#8217;s Prime Steakhouse &#38; Wine Bar units to 100 over time. In the second quarter of 2015, we made the decision to slow Bonefish Grill restaurant development until there is an improvement in our sales results. We believe long-term growth opportunities remain for Bonefish Grill, as the majority of restaurants are located in the southern and eastern U.S., with significant geographic expansion potential in the top 100 U.S. markets. 

International Development - We continue to expand internationally, leveraging established equity and franchise markets in Asia and South America, and in strategically selected emerging and high-growth developed markets, focusing on Brazil and China. In March 2015, we opened our first Abbraccio Cucina Italiana in Brazil. The first Fleming&#8217;s Prime Steakhouse &#38; Wine Bar in Brazil (&#8220;Fleming&#8217;s Brazil&#8221;) is expected to open during the first half of fiscal 2016. We will own a 20% interest in Fleming&#8217;s Brazil. 

New restaurant growth in Brazil will be our top international development priority in 2016, as we continue to develop additional concepts in that market. We see significant potential for growth of Outback Steakhouse in Brazil to 100 restaurants within the next three years. 

See Item 2 - Properties for disclosure of our international restaurant count by country. 

RESEARCH &#38; DEVELOPMENT / INNOVATION 

We utilize a global core menu policy to ensure consistency and quality in our menu offerings. Before we add an item to the core menu, our research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) team performs a thorough review of the item, including conducting consumer research, in order to assist us in determining the viability of adding the item. Internationally, we have teams in our developed markets that tailor our menus to address the preferences of local consumers. 

We continuously evolve our product offerings to improve our efficiency and based on consumer trends and feedback. We have a 12-month pipeline of new menu and promotional items across all concepts that allows us to quickly make adjustments in response to market demands, when necessary. In addition, we have dedicated resources focused on 

BLOOMIN&#8217; BRANDS, INC. 

productivity across the portfolio. For new menu items and significant product changes, we have a testing process that includes direct consumer feedback on the product and its pricing. R&#38;D expense was $6.5 million , $5.8 million &#32;and $6.4 million &#32; for fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

INFORMATION SYSTEMS 

Restaurant-level financial and accounting controls are handled through the point-of-sale (&#8220;POS&#8221;) system and network in each restaurant that communicates with our corporate headquarters. The POS system is also used to authorize and transmit credit card sales transactions. Our Company-owned restaurants, and most of our franchise restaurants, are connected through data centers and a portal to provide our corporate employees and regional partners with access to business information and tools that allow them to collaborate, communicate, train and share information. 

We continue to invest in our infrastructure to provide a better overall consumer experience, reduce our costs, create efficiencies and enhance security. During 2015 , we implemented a new facilities management solution to reduce maintenance costs and made improvements to our centralized inventory management system which monitors our commodity costs. We also made infrastructure enhancements to our restaurants to improve customer satisfaction. 

ADVERTISING AND MARKETING 

We generally advertise through national and spot television and radio media. Our concepts have an active public relations program and also rely on national promotions, site visibility, local marketing, digital marketing, direct mail, billboards and point-of-sale materials to promote our restaurants. In recent years, we have increased the use of digital advertising which has allowed us to be more efficient with our advertising expenditures. Internationally, we have teams in our developed markets that engage local agencies to tailor advertising to each market and develop relevant and timely promotions based on local consumer demand. 

To help maintain consumer interest and relevance, each concept leverages limited-time offers featuring seasonal specials. We promote limited-time offers through integrated marketing programs that utilize all of our advertising resources. 

RESTAURANT OPERATIONS 

Management and Employees - The management staff of our restaurants varies by concept and restaurant size. Our restaurants employ primarily hourly employees, many of whom work part-time. The Restaurant Managing Partner has primary responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the restaurant and is required to abide by Company-established operating standards. Area Operating Partners are responsible for overseeing the operations of typically six to 14 restaurants and Restaurant Managing Partners in a specific region. 

Area Operating Partners, Restaurant Managing Partner and Chef Partner Programs - Area Operating Partners, Restaurant Managing Partners and Chef Partners generally receive bonuses for providing management and supervisory services to their restaurants based on a percentage of their restaurants&#8217; monthly distributable cash flow (&#8220;Monthly Payments&#8221;). 

Restaurant Managing Partners and Chef Partners in the U.S. are eligible to participate in deferred compensation programs. Under these deferred compensation programs, the Restaurant Managing Partners and Chef Partners are eligible to receive payments beginning upon completion of their five-year employment agreement. We invest in various corporate-owned life insurance policies, which are held within an irrevocable grantor or &#8220;rabbi&#8221; trust account for settlement of our obligations under the deferred compensation plans. 

On the fifth anniversary of the opening of each new U.S. Company-owned restaurant, the Area Operating Partner supervising the restaurant during the first five years of operation receives an additional bonus based upon the average distributable cash flow of the restaurant for the preceding 24 months. In addition to Monthly Payments and deferred compensation, Area Operating Partners, Restaurant Managing Partners and Chef Partners in the U.S. whose restaurants 

BLOOMIN&#8217; BRANDS, INC. 

and concepts achieve certain targets, including sales, profitability and traffic growth, are eligible to receive an annual bonus. 

Many of our international Restaurant Managing Partners enter into employment agreements and purchase participation interests in the cash distributions from the restaurants they manage. The amount and terms vary by country. This interest gives the partners the right to receive a percentage of the restaurant&#8217;s annual cash flows for the duration of the agreement. 

Supervision and Training - We require our Area Operating Partners and Restaurant Managing Partners to have significant experience in the full-service restaurant industry. All Area Operating Partners and Restaurant Managing Partners are required to complete a comprehensive training program that emphasizes our operating strategy, procedures and standards. The Restaurant Managing Partners and Area Operating Partners, together with our Presidents, Regional Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents of Training and Directors of Training, are responsible for selecting and training the employees for each new restaurant. 

Service &#32;- In order to better assess and improve our performance, we use a third-party research firm to conduct an ongoing satisfaction measurement program that provides us with industry benchmarking information for our Company-owned and franchise locations in the U.S. We have a similar consumer satisfaction measurement program for our international Company-owned locations. These programs measure satisfaction across a wide range of experience elements. 

Food Preparation and Quality Control - We have an R&#38;D facility located in Tampa, Florida that serves as a test kitchen and vendor product qualification site. Our quality assurance team manages internal auditors responsible for supplier evaluations and external third parties who inspect supplier adherence to quality, food safety and product specification. Our suppliers also utilize third-party labs for food safety and quality verification. Suppliers that do not comply with quality, food safety and other specifications are not utilized until they have corrective actions in place and are re-certified for compliance. We develop sourcing strategies for all commodity categories based on the dynamics of each category. In addition, we require our supplier partners to meet or exceed our quality assurance standards. 

Our operational teams have multiple touch points in the restaurants ensuring food safety, quality and freshness throughout all phases of the preparation process. In addition, we employ third-party auditors to verify our standards of food safety, training and sanitation. 

SOURCING AND SUPPLY 

We take a global approach to procurement and supply chain management, with our corporate team serving all U.S. and international concepts. In addition, we have dedicated supply chain management personnel for our international operations in Asia and South America. The supply chain management organization is responsible for all food and operating supply purchases as well as a large percentage of purchases of field and corporate services. 

We address the end-to-end costs (from the source to the fork) associated with the products and goods we purchase by utilizing a combination of global, regional and local suppliers to capture efficiencies and economies of scale. This &#8220;total cost of ownership&#8221; (&#8220;TCO&#8221;) approach focuses on the initial purchase price, coupled with the cost structure underlying the procurement and order fulfillment process. The TCO approach includes monitoring commodity markets and trends to execute product purchases at the most advantageous times. 

We have a national distribution program that includes food, beverage, smallwares and packaging goods in all major markets. This program is managed by a custom distribution company that only provides products approved for our system. This customized relationship also enables our staff to effectively manage and prioritize our supply chain. 

Proteins represent 62% &#32;of our global commodity procurement composition, with beef representing 53% &#32;of purchased proteins. In 2015 , we purchased more than 90% &#32;of our beef raw materials from four &#32;beef suppliers that represent approximately 85% &#32;of the total U.S. beef marketplace. Due to the nature of our industry, we expect to continue purchasing a substantial amount of our beef from a small number of suppliers. Other major commodity categories 

BLOOMIN&#8217; BRANDS, INC. 

purchased include produce, dairy, bread and pasta, and energy sources to operate our restaurants, such as natural gas and electricity. 

RESTAURANT OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES 

Our restaurants are Company-owned or operated under franchise arrangements. We generate our revenues primarily from our Company-owned restaurants and secondarily through ongoing royalties from our franchised restaurants and sales of franchise rights. 

Company-Owned Restaurants - Company-owned restaurants include restaurants wholly-owned by us and restaurants in which we have a majority ownership. Our cash flows from entities in which we have a majority ownership are limited to the portion of our ownership. The results of operations of Company-owned restaurants are included in our consolidated operating results and the portion of income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests is eliminated in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income . 

We pay royalties on the majority of our Carrabba&#8217;s Italian Grill restaurants pursuant to agreements we entered into with the Carrabba&#8217;s Italian Grill founders (&#8220;Carrabba&#8217;s Founders&#8221;). Following is a summary of Carrabba&#8217;s royalties and sales in the U.S. subject to royalties as of December 27, 2015 :

Each Carrabba&#8217;s restaurant located outside the United States pays a one-time lump sum fee to the Carrabba&#8217;s Founders, which varies depending on the size of the restaurant. No continuing royalty fee is paid to the Carrabba&#8217;s Founders for Carrabba&#8217;s restaurants located outside the United States. 

Unaffiliated Franchise Program &#32;- Our unaffiliated franchise agreements grant third parties rights to establish and operate a restaurant using one of our concepts. Franchised restaurants are required to be operated in accordance with the franchise agreement and in compliance with their respective concept&#8217;s standards and specifications. 

In recent years, we updated our standard U.S. and international franchise agreements for all new and renewing franchisees. The majority of our existing franchisees continue to operate under previous franchise agreements. As each franchise location renews, we expect that the location will convert to our then-current franchise agreement. 

BLOOMIN&#8217; BRANDS, INC. 

Under our franchise agreements, each of our franchisees is required to pay an initial franchise fee and pay monthly royalties based on a percentage of gross restaurant sales. Initial franchise fees are $40,000 for U.S. franchisees and range between $40,000 and $75,000 for international franchisees, depending on its market. Some franchisees may also pay administration fees based on a percentage of gross restaurant sales.

T-Bird Restaurant Group, Inc. (&#8220;T-Bird&#8221;) is party to an Outback Steakhouse Master Franchise Agreement. T-Bird, through its affiliates, owns and operates 56 Outback Steakhouse restaurants in California. T-Bird is also party to a separate Outback Steakhouse development agreement, which gives T-Bird the exclusive right to open additional Outback Steakhouse restaurants in California through 2031 and commits T-Bird to opening seven new Outback Steakhouse restaurants in California by January 2022. Each new Outback Steakhouse restaurant that T-Bird opens in California is governed by the Master Franchise Agreement. As of December 27, 2015 , no new Outback Steakhouse restaurants have opened under T-Bird&#8217;s development agreement. 

COMPETITION 

The restaurant industry is highly competitive with a substantial number of restaurant operators that compete directly and indirectly with us in respect to price, service, location and food quality, and there are other well-established competitors with significant financial and other resources. There is also active competition for management personnel, attractive suitable real estate sites, supplies and restaurant employees. In addition, competition is also influenced strongly by marketing and brand reputation. At an aggregate level, all major U.S. casual dining restaurants and casual dining restaurants in the international markets in which we operate would be considered competitors of our concepts. Further, we face growing competition from the supermarket industry and home delivery services, with improved selections of prepared meals, and from quick service and fast casual restaurants, as a result of higher-quality food and beverage offerings. Internationally, we face increasing competition due to an increase in the number of casual dining restaurant options in the markets in which we operate. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

We are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws affecting our business. Each of our restaurants is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which may include, among others, alcoholic beverage control, health and safety, nutritional menu labeling, health care, environmental and fire agencies in the state, municipality or country in which the restaurant is located. 

U.S. - Alcoholic beverage sales represent 15% &#32;of our U.S. restaurant sales. Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities 

BLOOMIN&#8217; BRANDS, INC. 

for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises and to provide service for extended hours and on Sundays. 

Our restaurant operations are also subject to federal and state laws for such matters as: 

&#8226; 

immigration, employment, minimum wages, overtime, tip credits, worker conditions and health care; 

&#8226; 

nutritional labeling, nutritional content, menu labeling and food safety; 

&#8226; 

the Americans with Disabilities Act, which, among other things, requires our restaurants to meet federally mandated requirements for the disabled; and 

&#8226; 

information security, privacy, cashless payments, gift cards and consumer credit, protection and fraud. 

International - Our restaurants outside of the United States are subject to similar local laws and regulations as our U.S. restaurants, including labor, food safety and information security. In addition, we are subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations. 

See Item 1A - Risk Factors &#32;for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, local and international regulation of our business.

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 27, 2015 , we employed approximately 100,000 persons, of which approximately 1,100 are corporate personnel. None of our U.S. employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Various national industry-wide labor agreements apply to certain of our employees in Brazil. We consider our employee relations to be good. 

TRADEMARKS 

We regard our Outback &#174; , Outback Steakhouse &#174; , Carrabba&#8217;s Italian Grill &#174; , Bonefish Grill &#174; , and Fleming&#8217;s Prime Steakhouse &#38; Wine Bar &#174; &#32;service marks and our Bloomin&#8217; Onion &#174; &#32;trademark as having significant value and as being important factors in the marketing of our restaurants. We have also obtained trademarks for several of our other menu items and for various advertising slogans. We are aware of names and marks similar to the service marks of ours used by other persons in certain geographic areas in which we have restaurants. However, we believe such uses will not adversely affect us. Our policy is to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our marks. 

We license the use of our registered trademarks to franchisees and third parties through franchise arrangements and licenses. The franchise and license arrangements restrict franchisees&#8217; and licensees&#8217; activities with respect to the use of our trademarks, and impose quality control standards in connection with goods and services offered in connection with the trademarks. 

SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY RESULTS 

Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, customer traffic patterns for our established U.S. restaurants are generally highest in the first quarter of the year and lowest in the third quarter of the year. International customer traffic patterns vary by market. For example, Brazil historically experiences minimal seasonal traffic fluctuations, and South Korea restaurant traffic is generally highest in the first quarter of the year and lowest in the second quarter of the year. Additionally, holidays and severe weather may affect sales volumes seasonally in some of our markets. 

Quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly affected by general economic conditions, the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated pre-opening costs, restaurant closures and exit-related costs and impairments of goodwill, definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, fixtures and equipment. In 2014, we changed our fiscal year end, which impacted the comparability of our quarterly and annual results to prior periods. 

BLOOMIN&#8217; BRANDS, INC. 

As a result of these and other factors, our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.
