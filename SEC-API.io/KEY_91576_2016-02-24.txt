 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

KeyCorp, organized in 1958 under the laws of the State of Ohio, is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. We are a BHC under the BHCA and one of the nation&#146;s largest bank-based financial services companies, with consolidated total assets of approximately $95.1 billion at December 31, 2015. KeyCorp is the parent holding company for KeyBank National Association (&#147;KeyBank&#148;), its principal subsidiary, through which most of our banking services are provided. Through KeyBank and certain other subsidiaries, we provide a wide range of retail and commercial banking, commercial leasing, investment management, consumer finance, commercial mortgage servicing and special servicing, and investment banking products and services to individual, corporate, and institutional clients through two major business segments: Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. 

As of December 31, 2015, these services were provided across the country through KeyBank&#146;s 966 full-service retail banking branches and a network of 1,256 ATMs in 12 states, as well as additional offices, online and mobile banking capabilities, and a telephone banking call center. Additional information pertaining to our two business segments is included in the &#147;Line of Business Results&#148; section in Item 7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report, and in Note 23 (&#147;Line of Business Results&#148;) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which are incorporated herein by reference. KeyCorp and its subsidiaries had an average of 13,483 full-time equivalent employees for 2015. 

In addition to the customary banking services of accepting deposits and making loans, our bank and trust company subsidiaries offer personal, securities lending and custody services, personal financial services, access to mutual funds, treasury services, investment banking and capital markets products, and international banking services. Through our bank, trust company, and registered investment adviser subsidiaries, we provide investment management services to clients that include large corporate and public retirement plans, foundations and endowments, high-net-worth individuals, and multi-employer trust funds established for providing pension or other benefits to employees. 

We provide other financial services &#151; both within and outside of our primary banking markets &#151; through various nonbank subsidiaries. These services include community development financing, securities underwriting, and brokerage. We also provide merchant services to businesses directly and through an equity participation in a joint venture. 

KeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banks and other subsidiaries. Accordingly, the right of KeyCorp, its security holders, and its creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of its banks and other subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of such banks and other subsidiaries, except to the extent that KeyCorp&#146;s claims in its capacity as a creditor may be recognized.

Acquisitions and Divestitures 

On October 30, 2015, we announced that KeyCorp entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which KeyCorp will acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of First Niagara. The merger is currently expected to be completed during the third quarter of 2016 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of regulators and the shareholders of both KeyCorp and First Niagara. For more information on the First Niagara acquisition and other acquisitions and divestitures by Key, see Note 13 (&#147;Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations&#148;), which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Competition 

The market for banking and related financial services is highly competitive. Key competes with other providers of financial services, such as BHCs, commercial banks, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment management firms, investment banking firms, broker-dealers, and other local, regional, national, and global institutions that offer financial services. Some of our competitors are larger and may have more financial resources, while some of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. The financial services industry has become more competitive as technology advances have lowered barriers to entry, enabling more companies, including nonbank companies, to provide financial services. Technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial institutions. We compete by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices, and by maintaining our product and service offerings to keep pace with customer preferences and industry standards. 

Mergers and acquisitions have led to increased concentration in the banking industry, placing added competitive pressure on Key&#146;s core banking products and services.

&#160;

Supervision and Regulation 

The regulatory framework applicable to BHCs and banks is intended primarily to protect customers and depositors, the DIF, consumers, taxpayers and the banking system as a whole, rather than to protect the security holders and creditors of financial services companies. Comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing. We cannot predict changes in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory agency policies, but such changes may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or access to liquidity or credit. 

Overview 

As a BHC, KeyCorp is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. Under the BHCA, BHCs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of any bank, without prior approval by the Federal Reserve. In addition, BHCs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities. 

Under federal law, a BHC must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions by providing financial assistance to them in the event of their financial distress. This support may be required when we do not have the resources to, or would prefer not to, provide it. Certain loans by a BHC to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in, and certain other indebtedness of, the subsidiary bank. In addition, federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a BHC, any commitment by the BHC to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. 

Federal law establishes a system of regulation under which the Federal Reserve is the umbrella regulator for BHCs, while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential and functional regulators: 1) the OCC for national banks and federal savings associations; 2) the FDIC for non-member state banks and savings associations; 3) the Federal Reserve for member state banks; 4) the CFPB for consumer financial products or services; 5) the SEC and FINRA for securities broker/dealer activities; 6) the SEC, CFTC, and NFA for swaps and other derivatives; and 7) state insurance regulators for insurance activities. Certain specific activities, including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities, may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a &#147;broker&#148; or a &#147;dealer&#148; in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation. Although the states generally must regulate bank insurance activities in a nondiscriminatory manner, the states may continue to adopt and enforce rules that specifically regulate bank insurance activities in certain identifiable risks. 

Our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC. At December 31, 2015, we operated one full-service, FDIC-insured national bank subsidiary, KeyBank, and one national bank subsidiary that is limited to fiduciary activities. The FDIC also has certain regulatory, supervisory and examination authority over KeyBank and KeyCorp under the FDIA and the Dodd-Frank Act. 

We have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, as well as other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations. Because KeyBank engages in derivative transactions, in 2013 it provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC and became a member of the NFA, the self-regulatory organization for participants in the U.S. derivatives industry. Our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the SEC, FINRA, and state securities regulators, and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate. Our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business. 

&#160;

Regulatory capital and liquidity 

Federal banking regulators have promulgated risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements applicable to Key and KeyBank (consolidated). The adequacy of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by federal banking agencies in their examination and supervision processes, and in the evaluation of applications in connection with certain expansion activities. 

Regulatory capital requirements prior to January 1, 2015 

At December 31, 2014, the minimum risk-based capital requirements adopted by federal banking regulators were based on a 1988 international accord (&#147;Basel I&#148;) developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#147;Basel Committee&#148;). Prior to January 2015, Key and KeyBank (consolidated) were generally required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%. At least half of the total capital had to be &#147;Tier 1 capital,&#148; which consists of qualifying perpetual preferred stock, common shareholders&#146; equity (excluding AOCI other than the cumulative effect of foreign currency translation), a limited amount of qualifying trust preferred securities, and certain mandatorily convertible preferred securities. The remainder could consist of &#147;Tier 2 capital,&#148; including qualifying subordinated debt, certain hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt instruments, qualifying perpetual preferred stock, and a limited amount of the allowance for credit losses. BHCs and banks with securities and commodities trading activities exceeding specified levels were required to maintain capital to cover their market risk exposure. Federal banking regulators also established a minimum leverage ratio requirement for banking organizations. The leverage ratio is Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total assets. At December 31, 2014, the minimum leverage ratio was 3% for BHCs and national banks that are considered &#147;strong&#148; by the Federal Reserve or the OCC, respectively, 3% for any BHC that had implemented the Federal Reserve&#146;s risk-based capital measure for market risk, and 4% for all other BHCs and national banks. At December 31, 2014, the minimum leverage ratio for Key and KeyBank (consolidated) was 3% and 4%, respectively. BHCs and national banks may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels, depending upon their particular condition, risk profile, or growth plans. As presented in Note 22 (&#147;Shareholders&#146; Equity&#148;), at December 31, 2014, Key and KeyBank (consolidated) had regulatory capital in excess of all applicable minimum risk-based capital (including all adjustments for market risk) and leverage ratio requirements. 

Basel III capital and liquidity frameworks 

In December 2010, the Basel Committee released its final framework to strengthen international capital regulation of banks, and revised it in June 2011 and January 2014 (as revised, the &#147;Basel III capital framework&#148;). The Basel III capital framework requires higher and better-quality capital, better risk coverage, the introduction of a new leverage ratio as a backstop to the risk-based requirement, and measures to promote the buildup of capital that can be drawn down in periods of stress. The Basel III capital framework, among other things, introduces a new capital measure, &#147;Common Equity Tier 1,&#148; to be included in Tier 1 capital with other capital instruments meeting specified requirements, a capital conservation buffer, and a countercyclical capital buffer. The Basel III capital framework is being phased-in over a multi-year period. 

In November 2011, the Basel Committee issued its final rule for a common equity surcharge on certain designated global systemically important banks (&#147;G-SIBs&#148;), which was revised in July 2013 (as revised, &#147;Basel G-SIB framework&#148;). Under the Basel G-SIB framework, a G-SIB is assessed a progressive 1.0% to 3.5% surcharge to the Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer based upon the bank&#146;s systemic importance score. In July 2015, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule to implement the common equity surcharge on U.S. G-SIBS. The final rule was effective December 1, 2015, although the surcharge, which will be added to the capital conservation buffer under the Regulatory Capital Rules, will be phased in during the January 1, 2016, through January 1, 2019, period. This final rule applies to advanced approaches banking organizations, not &#147;standardized approach&#148; banking organizations like Key. 

&#160;

The Basel Committee published its international liquidity standards in 2010, and revised them in January 2013, January 2014, and October 2014 (as revised, the &#147;Basel III liquidity framework&#148;). It established quantitative standards for liquidity by introducing a liquidity coverage ratio (&#147;Basel III LCR&#148;) and a net stable funding ratio (&#147;Basel III NSFR&#148;). The Basel Committee published final Basel III NSFR disclosure standards in June 2015. 

The Basel III LCR, calculated as the ratio of the stock of high-quality liquid assets divided by total net cash outflows over 30 consecutive calendar days, must be at least 100%. The implementation of Basel III LCR began on January 1, 2015, with minimum requirements beginning at 60%, rising in annual steps of 10% until full implementation on January 1, 2019. 

The Basel III NSFR, calculated as the ratio of the available amount of stable funding divided by the required amount of stable funding, must be at least 100%. The Basel III NSFR becomes effective on January 1, 2018. 

U.S. implementation of the Basel III capital framework 

In October 2013, the federal banking regulators published the final Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the &#147;Regulatory Capital Rules&#148;), which generally implement the Basel III capital framework as described above in the United States. Under the Regulatory Capital Rules, certain large U.S.-domiciled BHCs and banks (each, an &#147;advanced approaches banking organization&#148;) must satisfy minimum qualifying criteria using organization-specific internal risk measures and management processes for calculating risk-based capital requirements as well as follow certain methodologies to calculate their total risk-weighted assets. Since neither KeyCorp nor KeyBank has at least $250 billion in total consolidated assets or at least $10 billion of total on-balance sheet foreign exposure, neither KeyCorp nor KeyBank is an advanced approaches banking organization. Instead, each of them is a &#147;standardized approach banking organization.&#148; 

New minimum capital and leverage ratio requirements 

Under the Regulatory Capital Rules, a standardized approach banking organization, like KeyCorp, is required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table. At December 31, 2015, Key had an estimated Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 10.85% under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules. Also at December 31, 2015, based on the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules, Key estimates that its capital and leverage ratios, after adjustment for market risk, would be as set forth in the following table.

As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% imposed upon an advanced approaches banking organization under the Regulatory Capital Rules. &#160;

(c) As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which becomes effective January 1, 2018. Revised prompt corrective action capital category ratios 

Federal prompt corrective action regulations under the FDIA group FDIC-insured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories: &#147;well capitalized,&#148; &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148; &#147;undercapitalized,&#148; &#147;significantly undercapitalized,&#148; and &#147;critically undercapitalized.&#148; In addition to implementing the Basel III capital framework in the U.S., the Regulatory Capital Rules also revised the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to FDIC-insured depository institutions such as KeyBank effective January 1, 2015. The Revised Prompt Corrective Action Rules table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a &#147;well capitalized&#148; and an &#147;adequately capitalized&#148; institution under the Regulatory Capital Rules.

(a) A &#147;well capitalized&#148; institution also must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. &#160;

(b) As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyBank is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which becomes effective January 1, 2018. We believe that, as of December 31, 2015, KeyBank (consolidated) met all revised &#147;well capitalized&#148; prompt corrective action capital and leverage ratio requirements under the Regulatory Capital Rules. The prompt corrective action regulations, however, apply only to FDIC-insured depository institutions (like KeyBank) and not to BHCs (like KeyCorp). Moreover, since the regulatory capital categories under these regulations serve a limited supervisory function, investors should not use them as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of KeyBank. 

U.S. implementation of the Basel III liquidity framework 

In October 2014, the federal banking agencies published the final Basel III liquidity framework for U.S. banking organizations (the &#147;Liquidity Coverage Rules&#148;) that create a minimum LCR for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies (excluding KeyCorp) and a modified version of the LCR (&#147;Modified LCR&#148;) for BHCs and other depository institution holding companies with over $50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active (including KeyCorp). 

KeyBank will not be subject to the LCR or the Modified LCR under the Liquidity Coverage Rules unless the OCC affirmatively determines that application to KeyBank is appropriate in light of KeyBank&#146;s asset size, level of complexity, risk profile, scope of operations, affiliation with foreign or domestic covered entities, or risk to the financial system. The LCR and Modified LCR created by the Liquidity Coverage Rules are also an enhanced prudential liquidity standard consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act. 

Because KeyCorp is a Modified LCR BHC under the Liquidity Coverage Rules, Key is required to maintain its ratio of high-quality liquid assets to its total net cash outflow amount, determined by prescribed assumptions in a 

&#160;

standardized hypothetical stress scenario over a 30-calendar day period, at least at 90% by January 1, 2016, and at least at 100% by January 1, 2017. At December 31, 2015, Key&#146;s estimated Modified LCR was above 100%. In the future, Key may change the composition of our investment portfolio, increase the size of the overall investment portfolio, and modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position. Calculation of Key&#146;s Modified LCR is required on a monthly basis, unlike on a daily basis for those U.S. banking organizations that are subject to the LCR rather than the Modified LCR. On December 1, 2015, the Federal Reserve published an NPR requesting public comment on a proposed rule that would implement quarterly quantitative and qualitative public disclosure requirements regarding the LCR. The proposed rule would require compliance with these requirements beginning on January 1, 2018, for Modified LCR BHCs like KeyCorp. Comments on the NPR were due by February 2, 2016. 

The federal banking regulators have not yet issued any proposal to implement either the final Basel III NSFR or the final Basel III NSFR disclosure standards. 

Capital planning and stress testing 

The Federal Reserve&#146;s capital plan rule requires each U.S.-domiciled, top-tier BHC with total consolidated assets of at least $50 billion (like KeyCorp) to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process. The capital plan must be submitted annually to the Federal Reserve for supervisory review in connection with its annual CCAR. The supervisory review includes an assessment of many factors, including Key&#146;s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon. KeyCorp is also subject to the Federal Reserve&#146;s supervisory expectations for capital planning and capital positions as a large, noncomplex BHC. These expectations are set forth in the Federal Reserve&#146;s guidance issued on December 18, 2015 (&#147;SR Letter 15-19&#148;). Under SR Letter 15-19, the Federal Reserve identifies its core capital planning expectations regarding governance, risk management, internal controls, capital policy, capital positions, incorporating stressful conditions and events, and estimating impact on capital positions for large and noncomplex firms building upon the capital planning requirements under its capital plan and stress test rules. SR Letter 15-19 also provides detailed supervisory expectations on such a firm&#146;s capital planning processes. 

The Federal Reserve&#146;s annual CCAR is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large, complex U.S. BHCs and of the practices these BHCs use to assess their capital needs. The Federal Reserve expects BHCs subject to CCAR to have sufficient capital to withstand a severely adverse operating environment and to be able to continue operations, maintain ready access to funding, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, and serve as credit intermediaries. 

KeyCorp filed its 2015 CCAR capital plan on January 5, 2015. KeyCorp is required to submit its 2016 CCAR capital plan by April 6, 2016. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it will announce the results of its supervisory stress tests by June 30, 2016, with the exact date to be announced before then. 

As part of the annual CCAR, the Federal Reserve conducts an annual supervisory stress test on KeyCorp. As part of this test, the Federal Reserve projects revenue, expenses, losses, and resulting post-stress capital levels and regulatory capital ratios under conditions that affect the U.S. economy or the financial condition of KeyCorp, including supervisory baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenarios, that are determined annually by the Federal Reserve. The 2015 CCAR results, which included the annual supervisory stress test methodology and certain firm-specific results for the participating covered companies (including KeyCorp), were publicly released by the Federal Reserve in March 2015. 

In December 2015, the Federal Reserve published amendments to its capital plan and stress test rules. Under the amendments, for a standardized approach BHC like KeyCorp, the Federal Reserve has removed the Tier 1 common capital ratio requirement as well as modified certain mandatory capital action assumptions. The modifications to the mandatory capital action assumptions include the requirement for the BHC to assume in its 

&#160;

stress tests that: (i) it issues capital associated with funding a planned acquisition or merger to the extent the merger or acquisition is reflected in the BHC&#146;s pro forma balance sheet estimates, and (ii) it pays planned dividends on any issuance of stock related to expensed employee compensation. The modifications also incorporate the deduction from Tier 1 capital of a BHC&#146;s investment in certain hedge funds and private equity funds that are covered by section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the &#147;Volcker Rule.&#148; 

KeyCorp and KeyBank must also conduct their own company-run stress tests to assess the impact of stress scenarios (including supervisor-provided baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenarios and, for KeyCorp, one KeyCorp-defined baseline scenario and at least one KeyCorp-defined stress scenario) on their consolidated earnings, losses, and capital over a nine-quarter planning horizon, taking into account their current condition, risks, exposures, strategies, and activities. While KeyBank must only conduct an annual stress test, KeyCorp must conduct both an annual and a mid-cycle stress test. KeyCorp and KeyBank are required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the Federal Reserve and OCC. KeyCorp is required to report the results of its mid-cycle stress test to the Federal Reserve. KeyCorp and KeyBank published the results of their company-run annual stress test on March 5, 2015. KeyCorp published the results of its company-run mid-cycle stress test on July 28, 2015. Summaries of the results of these company-run stress tests are disclosed each year under the &#147;Regulatory Disclosure&#148; tab of Key&#146;s Investor Relations website: http://www.key.com/ir. 

Dividend restrictions 

Federal banking law and regulations impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries, (like KeyBank). Historically, dividends paid by KeyBank have been an important source of cash flow for KeyCorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt. Dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test. Under the earnings retention test, without the prior approval of the OCC, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year&#146;s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank&#146;s undivided profits. Moreover, under the FDIA, an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the payment would cause it to be in a less than &#147;adequately capitalized&#148; prompt corrective action capital category or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the FDIC. For more information about the payment of dividends by KeyBank to KeyCorp, please see Note 3 (&#147;Restrictions on Cash, Dividends and Lending Activities&#148;) in this report. 

FDIA, Resolution Authority and Financial Stability 

Deposit insurance and assessments 

The DIF provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like KeyBank. The amount of deposit insurance coverage for each depositor&#146;s deposits is $250,000 per depository. 

The FDIC must assess the premium based on an insured depository institution&#146;s assessment base, calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity. KeyBank&#146;s current annualized premium assessments can range from $.025 to $.45 for each $100 of its assessment base. The rate charged depends on KeyBank&#146;s performance on the FDIC&#146;s &#147;large and highly complex institution&#148; risk-assessment scorecard, which includes factors such as KeyBank&#146;s regulatory rating, its ability to withstand asset and funding-related stress, and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of KeyBank&#146;s failure. 

In November 2015, the FDIC published an NPR and request for comments proposing to impose a surcharge, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, on the quarterly deposit insurance assessments of insured depository institutions having total consolidated assets of at least $10 billion (like KeyBank). Such surcharge would begin the calendar quarter after the DIF reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.15% and would continue through the quarter that it 

&#160;

first reaches or exceeds 1.35%. At September 30, 2015, the DIF reserve ratio was 1.09%. The surcharge would equal an annual rate of 0.00045% applied to the institution&#146;s assessment base (with certain adjustments). The FDIC expects that these surcharges will commence in 2016 and that they should be sufficient to raise the DIF reserve ratio to 1.35% in approximately eight quarters (i.e., before the end of 2018). If, contrary to the FDIC&#146;s expectations, the DIF reserve ratio does not reach 1.35% by December 31, 2018 (provided it is at least 1.15%), the FDIC would impose a shortfall assessment on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of at least $10 billion (like KeyBank) on March 31, 2019. The comment period for the NPR expired in early January 2016. 

Conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions 

Upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution, the FDIC will be appointed as receiver or, in rare circumstances, conservator for the insolvent institution under the FDIA. In an insolvency, the FDIC may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the FDIC determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institution&#146;s affairs. If the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership (or conservatorship) for breach of contract, the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon, among other factors, the receivership (or conservatorship) assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others. In addition, the FDIC may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution, notwithstanding any provision that would terminate, cause a default, accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency, the appointment of the receiver (or conservator), or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver (or conservator). The FDIC may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institution&#146;s shareholders or creditors. These provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of KeyCorp&#146;s insured depository institution subsidiaries, such as KeyBank, including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors. 

Receivership of certain SIFIs 

The Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution regime, as an alternative to bankruptcy, known as the &#147;orderly liquidation authority&#148; (&#147;OLA&#148;) for certain SIFIs, including BHCs and their affiliates. Under the OLA, the FDIC would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind up a failing SIFI. The determination that a SIFI should be placed into OLA receivership is made by the U.S. Treasury Secretary, who must conclude that the SIFI is in default or in danger of default and that the SIFI&#146;s failure poses a risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system. This determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, and consultation between the U.S. Treasury Secretary and the President. 

If the FDIC is appointed as receiver under the OLA, its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the OLA. The powers of a receiver under the OLA are generally based on the FDIC&#146;s powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the FDIA. Certain provisions of the OLA were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors&#146; claims between the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the OLA. However, substantial differences between the two regimes remain, including the FDIC&#146;s right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure under OLA to determine creditors&#146; claims (rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy), the FDIC&#146;s right to transfer claims to a bridge entity, and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual cross-defaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership. OLA liquidity would be provided through credit support from the U.S. Treasury and assessments made, first, on claimants against the receivership that received more in the OLA resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation (to the full extent of the excess), and second, if necessary, on SIFIs, like KeyCorp, utilizing a risk-based methodology. 

In December 2013, the FDIC published a notice for comment regarding its &#147;single point of entry&#148; resolution strategy under the OLA. This strategy involves the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for the SIFI&#146;s top-level U.S. holding company only, while permitting the operating subsidiaries of the failed holding company to 

&#160;

continue operations uninterrupted. As receiver, the FDIC would establish a bridge financial company for the failed holding company and would transfer the assets and a very limited set of liabilities of the receivership estate. The claims of unsecured creditors and other claimants in the receivership would be satisfied by the exchange of their claims for the securities of one or more new holding companies emerging from the bridge company. The FDIC has not taken any subsequent regulatory action relating to this resolution strategy under OLA since the comment period ended in March 2014. 

Depositor preference 

The FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of its depositors (including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the FDIC) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will be placed ahead of unsecured, nondeposit creditors, including the institution&#146;s parent BHC and subordinated creditors, in order of priority of payment. 

Resolution plans 

BHCs with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyCorp, are required to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and FDIC a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress. Insured depository institutions with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyBank, are also required to submit a resolution plan to the FDIC. These plans are due annually by December 31 of each year. For 2015, these resolution plans, the third required from KeyCorp and KeyBank, were submitted on December 1, 2015. Annually, in January, the Federal Reserve and FDIC make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies, including KeyCorp and KeyBank, that submitted plans in the prior December. The public section of the resolution plans of KeyCorp and KeyBank is available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/resolution-plans.htm and https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/reform/resplans/. 

Financial Stability Oversight Council 

The Dodd-Frank Act created the FSOC, a systemic risk oversight body, to: (i) identify risks to U.S. financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected SIFIs, or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace, (ii) promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the U.S. government will shield shareholders, creditors, and counterparties from losses in the event of failure, and (iii) respond to emerging threats to the stability of the U.S. financial system. The FSOC is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination, information collection and sharing, designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve, designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment, clearing, and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight, recommending stricter standards for SIFIs, and, together with the Federal Reserve, determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to U.S. financial stability. 

The Bank Secrecy Act 

The BSA requires all financial institutions (including banks and securities broker-dealers) to, among other things, maintain a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. It includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as cash and suspicious activity reporting) as well as due diligence and know-your-customer documentation requirements. Key has established and maintains an anti-money laundering program to comply with the BSA&#146;s requirements. 

&#160;

Other Regulatory Developments under the Dodd-Frank Act 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 

Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than $10 billion, like Key, to carry out federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws. Any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the CFPB or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to Key&#146;s consumer-facing businesses. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices. 

&#147; Volcker Rule &#148; 

The Volcker Rule implements Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Volcker Rule prohibits &#147;banking entities,&#148; such as KeyCorp, KeyBank and their affiliates and subsidiaries, from owning, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds (referred to as &#147;covered funds&#148;) and engaging in short-term proprietary trading of securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options on these instruments. 

The Volcker Rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading, including transactions in government securities (e.g., U.S. Treasuries or any instruments issued by the GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC, a Federal Home Loan Bank, or any state or a political division of any state, among others); transactions in connection with underwriting or market-making activities; and, transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers. Banking entities may also engage in risk-mitigating hedges if the entity can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific, identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity. The banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and, if necessary, adjusted on an ongoing basis. Banking entities with more than $50 billion in total consolidated assets and liabilities, like Key, that engage in permitted trading transactions are required to implement enhanced compliance programs, to regularly report data on trading activities to the regulators, and to provide a CEO attestation that the entity&#146;s compliance program is reasonably designed to comply with the Volcker Rule. 

Although the Volcker Rule became effective on April 1, 2014, on December 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve exercised its unilateral authority to extend the compliance deadline until July 21, 2016, with respect to covered funds. The Federal Reserve further indicated its intent to grant an additional one-year extension of the compliance deadline until July 21, 2017, and indicated it would re-evaluate its rules relating to the process by which banking entities would be able to apply for further five-year extensions. Key does not anticipate that the proprietary trading restrictions in the Volcker Rule will have a material impact on its business, but it may be required to divest certain fund investments as discussed in more detail under the heading &#147;Other investments&#148; in Item 7 of this report. 

Enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements 

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve must impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements upon BHCs, like KeyCorp, with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets. Prudential standards must include enhanced risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, liquidity requirements, risk-management and risk committee requirements, resolution plan requirements, credit exposure report requirements, single counterparty credit limits (&#147;SCCL&#148;), supervisory and company-run stress test requirements and, for certain financial companies, a debt-to-equity limit. Early remediation requirements must include limits on capital distributions, acquisitions, and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans, capital raising requirements, limits on transactions with affiliates, management changes, and asset sales in later stages of financial decline, which are to be triggered by forward-looking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures. 

&#160;

The stress test requirements applicable to KeyCorp were implemented by a final rule adopted by the Federal Reserve in 2012. The resolution plan requirements applicable to KeyCorp were implemented by a joint final rule adopted by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in 2011. 

In March 2014, the Federal Reserve published a final rule to implement certain of these required enhanced prudential standards. The enhanced prudential standards implemented by this final rule were: (i) the incorporation of the Regulatory Capital Rules through the Federal Reserve&#146;s previously finalized rules on capital planning and stress tests, (ii) liquidity requirements relating to cash flow projections, a contingency funding plan, liquidity risk limits, monitoring liquidity risks (with respect to collateral, legal entities, currencies, business lines, and intraday exposures), liquidity stress testing, and a liquidity buffer, (iii) the risk management framework, the risk committee, and the chief risk officer as well as the corporate governance requirements as they relate to liquidity risk management, including the requirements that apply to the board of directors, the risk committee, senior management, and the independent review function, and (iv) a 15-to-1 debt-to-equity limit for companies that the FSOC determines pose a &#147;grave threat&#148; to U.S. financial stability. KeyCorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on January 1, 2015. 

The SCCL and the early remediation requirements published in January 2012 by the Federal Reserve as a proposed rule, however, were not included as part of the March 2014 final rule. It is unclear when the Federal Reserve will finalize the early remediation requirements. No credit exposure reporting requirements, which must be implemented jointly by the Federal Reserve and FDIC, have yet been proposed. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both the Federal Reserve and FDIC recognize that such reports would be most useful and complete if developed in conjunction with the SCCL. 

Bank transactions with affiliates 

Federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates, including the bank&#146;s parent BHC and certain companies the parent BHC may be deemed to control for these purposes. Transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm&#146;s-length terms, and cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the bank&#146;s regulatory capital. Moreover, if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit, it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute, and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral, the BHC may be required to provide it. These provisions materially restrict the ability of KeyBank to fund its affiliates, including KeyCorp, KBCM, certain of the Victory mutual funds with which we continue to have a relationship, and KeyCorp&#146;s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments (and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested). 

Provisions added by the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the scope of: (i) the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or BHC-affiliated company as an investment adviser, (ii) credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of low-quality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral, the quantitative limits, and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative, repurchase agreement, and securities lending/borrowing transactions, and (iii) transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliate-issued debt obligations that are not securities. In addition, these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding, rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction. These provisions also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements. While these provisions became effective on July 21, 2012, the Federal Reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them.
