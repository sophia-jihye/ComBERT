 ITEM 1. 

Business 

General 

We are a company focused on providing cleaner, lower carbon intensity products and services while also providing conventional products and services. Today, we principally generate revenue as a leading North American advanced biofuels producer and we are expanding into the development of renewable chemicals. We are currently the largest producer of biomass-based diesel in the United States. To do this, we utilize a nationwide production, distribution and logistics system as part of an 

integrated value chain model to focus on converting natural fats, oils and greases into advanced biofuels along with focusing to convert diverse feedstocks into renewable chemicals. During 2015 , we sold 375 million total gallons and had total revenues of $1.4 billion . 

We operate a network of ten biomass-based diesel plants, with an aggregate nameplate production capacity of 432 million gallons per year, or mmgy, and one fermentation facility. We believe our fully integrated approach, which includes acquiring feedstock, managing biorefinery facility construction and upgrades, operating biorefineries, marketing renewable products and distributing through a network of terminals, positions us to capitalize on growing demand for biomass-based diesel, renewable chemicals, other advanced biofuels along with other products and services. 

We are a lower-cost biomass-based diesel producer. We primarily produce our biomass-based diesel from a wide variety of lower cost feedstocks, including inedible corn oil, used cooking oil and inedible animal fat. We also produce biomass-based diesel from virgin vegetable oils, which are more widely available and tend to be higher in price. We believe our ability to process a wide variety of feedstocks provides us with a cost advantage over many biomass-based diesel producers, particularly those that rely primarily on higher cost virgin vegetable oils, such as soybean oil or canola oil. 

In 2014, we expanded into the production of renewable chemicals, additional advanced biofuels and other products through an acquisition of assets in January 2014 and the creation of REG Life Sciences, LLC. This industrial biotechnology business is a late-stage development company focusing on microbial fermentation to develop and produce renewable chemicals, fuels and other products. 

We sell petroleum-based heating oil and diesel fuel, which enables us to offer additional biofuel blends, while expanding our customer base. We sell heating oil and ultra-low sulfur diesel, or ULSD, at terminals throughout the northeastern U.S. as well as BioHeat&#174; blended fuel at one of our existing Northeastern terminal locations. We expanded our sales of additional biofuel blends to Midwest terminal locations and look to potentially expand to other areas across North America. 

We acquired a 75 mmgy nameplate capacity renewable hydrocarbon diesel biorefinery located in Geismar, Louisiana in June 2014. Our Geismar facility had been idled by its previous owner and began operating again by us in October 2014 after our completion of certain upgrades. The facility was idle again during the last 9 months of 2015 while repairs related to the two separate plant fires that occurred in April and September 2015 and upgrades were underway. 

We also expanded our business internationally by acquiring a majority interest in Petrotec AG, or Petrotec, in December 2014. During 2015, we acquired additional shares in Petrotec through cash tender offers and purchases on the open market. At December 31, 2015, we owned approximately 87% of Petrotec's outstanding shares. Petrotec is a fully-integrated company utilizing used cooking oil and other waste feedstocks to produce biomass-based diesel at its two biorefineries in Emden and Oeding, Germany. Petrotec&#8217;s nameplate production capacity is approximately 56 mmgy (185,000 metric tons or MT). 

In August 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Imperium Renewables, Inc., or Imperium, including a 100 mmgy nameplate biorefinery and terminal at the Port of Grays Harbor, Washington. The renamed REG Grays Harbor, LLC increased our North American nameplate production capacity by nearly one third and expanded our production fleet to the west coast of the United States. The Grays Harbor location includes 18 million gallons of storage capacity and a terminal that can accommodate feedstock intake and fuel delivery on deep-water PANAMAX class vessels as well as possessing significant rail and truck transport capabilities. To date, the production facility's primary feedstock has been canola oil sourced nearby in the Pacific Northwest.

In addition to the production facilities and fermentation facility listed above, we maintain a testing laboratory at our corporate headquarters in Ames, Iowa, which allows us to test various feedstocks for conversion into biomass-based diesel, as well as various manufacturing processes available in the production of biomass-based diesel. We also have a regional office in Tulsa, Oklahoma, focused on maintaining and developing advanced biofuel technologies. Our industrial biotechnology research and development activities, conducted in South San Francisco, are dedicated to the development of renewable chemicals, advanced biofuels and other products using our proprietary microbial fermentation technology. 

Our Feedstocks and Other Inputs 

Our ability to use a wide range of feedstocks gives us the flexibility to quickly respond to changes in feedstock pricing to maintain our feedstock cost advantage. We have the ability to rapidly change our processing techniques to accommodate different feedstocks and feedstock mixes. In 2015, approximately 85% of our total feedstock usage was lower cost inedible corn oil, used cooking oil or inedible animal fat feedstock and the remaining 15% was from refined vegetable oils, such as soybean oil or canola oil. 

We procure our feedstocks from numerous vendors in small to medium quantities. There is no established futures market for lower cost feedstocks. Inedible corn oil and used cooking oil can be purchased in nearby forward positions of three to twelve months on fixed priced contracts or sometimes indexed to the New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, NY Harbor ULSD index (previously referred to as NYMEX Heating Oil). We generally purchase inedible animal fats on a freight delivered basis and purchase in one to four week forward positions. Soybean oil can be purchased on a spot or forward contract basis from a number of suppliers. 

From time to time, we work with developers of next generation feedstocks, such as algae and camelina, to assist them in bringing these new feedstocks to market. We have converted several of these feedstocks, as well as other second generation feedstocks, into high quality biomass-based diesel in our laboratory and production facilities. We believe we are well positioned to incorporate these new feedstocks into our production process as they become commercially available. 

We procure methanol, chemical catalysts such as sodium methylate and hydrochloric acid, under fixed-price contracts and formula-indexed contracts based upon competitive bidding. These procurement contracts typically last from three months to one year. The price of methanol is indexed to the monthly reported published price of methanol plus or minus a negotiated basis. 

Distribution 

We have established a national distribution system to supply biomass-based diesel throughout the United States. Each of our biodiesel facilities is equipped with an on-site rail loading system, a truck loading system, or both, and a logistics and supply chain management staff. Our Seneca biorefinery near the Illinois River has direct barge access supplying customers using the inland waterways system. Our Houston biorefinery has barge and deep-water ship loading capability. Our Grays Harbor biorefinery has deep-water capability for PANAMAX class vessels. We also manage some customers&#8217; biomass-based diesel storage tanks and replenishment process. We lease 463 railcars for transportation and lease biomass-based diesel storage tanks in 39 terminals as of December 31, 2015. In general, the terminals where we lease our biomass-based diesel storage tanks are petroleum fuel terminals so that fuel distributors and other biomass-based diesel customers can create a biomass-based diesel blend at the terminal before further distribution. Terminal leases typically have one- to three-year terms and are generally renewable subject to certain terms and conditions. During 2015, we have sold our various products in 47 states and five provinces in Canada. 

Risk Management 

The prices for feedstocks and biomass-based diesel can be volatile and are not always closely correlated. Lower cost feedstocks are particularly difficult to risk manage given that such feedstocks are not traded in any public futures market. To manage feedstock and biomass-based diesel price risks, we utilize forward contracting, hedging and other risk management strategies, including the use of futures, swaps, options and over-the-counter products. 

In establishing our risk management strategies, we draw from our own in-house risk management expertise and we consult with industry experts. We utilize research conducted by outside firms to provide additional market information and risk management strategies. We believe combining these sources of knowledge, experience and expertise gives us a more sophisticated and global view of the fluctuating commodity markets for raw materials and energies, which we then can incorporate into our risk management strategies. 

Seasonality 

Biodiesel producers have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in demand for biodiesel. Biodiesel demand has tended to be lower during the winter in Northern and Midwestern states due to blending concentrations being reduced to adjust for performance issues during colder weather. This seasonal fluctuation is strongest for biodiesel made from inedible animal fats and used cooking oil. Biodiesel made from those feedstocks has a higher cloud point, the point at which a fuel begins to gel, than biodiesel produced from soybean oil, canola oil or inedible corn oil, which may cause cold weather performance issues. 

Renewable Identification Number, or RIN, prices may also be subject to seasonal fluctuations. The RIN is dated for the calendar year in which it is generated. Since 20% of an Obligated Party's annual Renewable Volume Obligation, or RVO, can be satisfied by prior year RINs, most RINs must come from biofuel produced or imported during the RVO year. As a result, RIN prices can be expected to increase as the calendar year progresses if the RIN market is undersupplied compared to that year's RVO and decrease if it is oversupplied. For further discussion and background on RINs, see "Government Programs Favoring Biomass-based Diesel Production and Use" below. 

Competition 

We face competition from producers and suppliers of petroleum-based diesel fuel, from other biomass-based diesel producers, marketers, traders and distributors. The size of the biomass-based diesel industry is small compared to the size of the petroleum-based diesel fuel industry and large petroleum companies have greater resources than we do. Our principal competitive differentiators are product quality, both biomass-based diesel and RIN quality, supply reliability and price. We also face competition in the biomass-based diesel RIN compliance market from producers of renewable hydrocarbon diesel and in the advanced biofuel RIN compliance market from producers of other advanced biofuels. In the United States and Canadian biomass-based diesel markets, we compete with large, multi-product companies that have greater resources than we do. Archer Daniels Midland Company, Cargill Incorporated, Louis Dreyfus Commodities Group and Ag Processing Inc. are major international agribusiness corporations and biodiesel producers with the financial sourcing and marketing resources to be formidable competitors in the biodiesel industry. These agribusiness competitors tend to make biodiesel from higher cost virgin vegetable oils such as soybean or canola oil, which they produce as part of their integrated agribusinesses. We are also in competition with producers of renewable hydrocarbon diesel, such as Neste Oil, which has approximately 720 million gallons of renewable hydrocarbon diesel production capacity in Asia and Europe and Diamond Green Diesel, LLC, the joint venture between Valero Energy Corp. and Darling International with approximately 160 million gallons of renewable diesel production capacity. Renewable hydrocarbon diesel can also satisfy the RFS2 biomass-based diesel requirement if the renewable hydrocarbon diesel meets the greenhouse gas reduction requirements and may satisfy Canadian renewable fuel requirements. Neste Oil and Diamond Green Diesel, LLC, have greater financial resources than we do. 

In the RFS2 advanced biofuel market, we also compete with other producers and importers of advanced biofuels, such as Brazilian sugarcane ethanol producers and producers of biogas used in transportation. We face increasing competition from imported biomass-based diesel and expect this to continue. In January 2015, the EPA announced the approval of a plan submitted by CARBIO, a consortium of Argentinean renewable fuel producers, which allows for Argentinian biodiesel made from soybean oil to generate RINs. Imported biomass-based diesel that does not qualify under RFS2, also competes in jurisdictions where there are biomass-based diesel blending requirements. 

We also face competition from independent biodiesel producers. Most of these competitors own only one biodiesel plant and thus, do not enjoy the benefits of scale that we do. Many of our competitors own biodiesel plants that can process only higher cost virgin vegetable oils. Furthermore, in our marketing and distribution, we face competition from biomass-based diesel traders such as US Oil, NGL, Noble, Morgan Stanley, Tenaska and Vitol. These trading companies may have greater financial resources than we do and are able to take significant biomass-based diesel positions in the marketplace. These competitors are often customers and/or suppliers of ours as well. 

Segment and Geographic Information 

Prior to 2015, our business was organized into two reportable segments - the Biomass-based Diesel segment and the Services segment. As of December 31, 2015, we began reporting for a new segment, Renewable Chemicals, which was previously included in the Biomass-based Diesel segment. Financial and geographic information regarding our segments can be found in Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report. 

Government Programs Favoring Biomass-Based Diesel Production and Use 

The biomass-based diesel industry benefits from numerous federal and state government programs, the most important of which is RFS2. 

Renewable Fuel Standard 

On July 1, 2010, RFS2&#8217;s biomass-based diesel requirement became effective, requiring for the first time that a certain percentage of the diesel fuel consumed in the United States be made from renewable sources. The biomass-based diesel requirement can be satisfied by two primary fuels, biodiesel and renewable hydrocarbon diesel. RFS2 required the use of one billion gallons of biomass-based diesel in 2012, required 1.28 billion gallons in 2013 and at least one billion gallons each year thereafter, with such higher amounts subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, proposals and the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, approval. On November 30, 2015, the EPA issued the final 2014 through 2016 RVO rules whereby the biomass-based diesel volumes were set at 1.63 billion, 1.73 billion, 1.90 billion gallons for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. In addition, for 2017, the EPA set the biomass-based diesel target at 2 billion gallons. 

The biomass-based diesel requirement is one of four separate renewable fuel requirements under RFS2. The RFS2 requirements are based on two primary categories and two subcategories. The two primary categories are conventional renewable fuel, which is primarily satisfied by corn ethanol, and advanced biofuel, which is defined as a biofuel that reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% compared to the petroleum-based fuel the biofuel is replacing. The advanced biofuel category has two subcategories, cellulosic biofuel, to be satisfied by newly developed cellulosic biofuels, such as ethanol made from woody biomass, and biomass-based diesel, which is satisfied by biodiesel and renewable hydrocarbon diesel, or RHD. RFS2&#8217;s total advanced biofuel requirement is larger than the combined cellulosic fuel and biomass-based diesel requirements, thus requiring the use of additional volumes of advanced biofuels. 

The RFS2 requirement for advanced biofuels can be satisfied by any advanced biofuel, including biodiesel, renewable hydrocarbon diesel, biogas used in transportation, biobutanol, cellulosic ethanol or sugarcane-based ethanol, so long as it meets the 50% greenhouse gas reduction requirement. The advanced biofuel requirement was 2.67 billion gallons in 2014, 2.88 billion gallons in 2015 and 3.61 billion gallons in 2016. 

The advanced biofuel RVO is expressed in terms of ethanol equivalent volumes, or EEV, which is based on the fuel&#8217;s renewable energy content compared to ethanol. Biodiesel has an EEV of 1.5 and RHD has an EEV of 1.5-1.7, compared to 1.0 for sugarcane-based ethanol. Accordingly, it requires less biomass-based diesel than sugarcane-based ethanol to meet the required volumes as each gallon of biomass-based diesel counts as more gallons for purposes of fulfilling the advanced biofuel RVO, providing an incentive for Obligated Parties to purchase biomass-based diesel to meet their advanced biofuel RVO. 

The RFS2 volume requirements apply to petroleum refiners and petroleum fuel importers in the 48 contiguous states and Hawaii, who are defined as &#8220;Obligated Parties&#8221; in the RFS2 regulations, and requires these Obligated Parties to incorporate into their petroleum-based fuel a certain percentage of renewable fuel or purchase credits in the form of RINs from those who do. An Obligated Party&#8217;s RVO is based on the volume of petroleum-based fuel they produce or import. The largest United States petroleum refining companies, such as Valero, Phillips 66, ExxonMobil, British Petroleum, Chevron and Shell, represent the majority of the total RVO, with the remainder made up of smaller refiners and importers. 

Renewable Identification Numbers 

The EPA created the renewable identification number, or RIN, system to track renewable fuel production and compliance with the renewable fuel standard. EPA registered producers of renewable fuel may generate RINs for each gallon of renewable fuel they produce. In the case of biomass-based diesel, generally 1.5 to 1.7 biomass-based diesel RINs may be generated for each gallon of biomass-based diesel produced, based upon the fuel's renewable energy content. Renewable fuel, including biomass-based diesel, can then be sold with associated RINs attached. RINs may also be separated from the gallons of renewable fuel they represent and once separated they may be sold as a separate commodity. RINs are ultimately used by Obligated Parties to demonstrate compliance with the RFS2. Obligated Parties must obtain and retire the required number of RINs to satisfy their RVO during a particular compliance period. An Obligated Party can obtain RINs by buying renewable fuels with RINs attached, buying RINs that have been separated, or producing renewable fuels themselves. All RIN activity under RFS2 must 

be entered into the EPA&#8217;s moderated transaction system, which tracks RIN generation, transfer and retirement. RINs are retired when used for compliance with the RFS2 requirements. 

The value of RINs is significant to the price of biomass-based diesel. During 2014, the value of RINs, as reported by OPIS, contributed to the average B100 spot price of a gallon of biomass-based, as reported by The Jacobsen, and range from a low of $0.64 per gallon, or 19%, in January to a high of $1.15 per gallon, or 34%, in December. In 2015, RIN prices as a percentage contribution to the average B100 spot price, as reported by OPIS fluctuated significantly throughout the year and range from a low of $0.58 per gallon, or 23%, in September to a high of $1.55 per gallon, or 53%, in January. 

Biodiesel Tax Credit 

The federal biodiesel mixture excise tax credit, or BTC, when in effect, provides a $1.00 per gallon excise tax credit to the first blender of biomass-based diesel with at least 0.1% petroleum-based diesel fuel. The biodiesel tax credit can then be credited against such biodiesel federal excise tax liability or the blender can obtain a cash refund from the United States Treasury for the value of the credit. The BTC became effective January 1, 2005 and then lapsed January 1, 2010 before being reinstated retroactively on December 17, 2010. The BTC again lapsed as of December 31, 2011 and on January 2, 2013, it was again reinstated, retroactively for 2012 and through December 31, 2013. The BTC lapsed again on December 31, 2013 and was retroactively reinstated for 2014 on December 19, 2014. On December 18, 2015, the BTC was reinstated for 2015 and will be in effect until December 31, 2016. It is uncertain whether the BTC will be reinstated thereafter and if reinstated, whether or not it would be reinstated retroactively. 

State Programs 

Several states have enacted legislation providing incentives for the use of biomass-based diesel, requiring the use of biomass-based diesel, or both. For example, Illinois offers an exemption from the generally applicable 6.25% sales tax on fuel for biomass-based diesel blends that incentivizes blending at 11% biomass-based diesel, or B11, through December 31, 2018. Illinois&#8217; program has made that state the largest biomass-based diesel market in the country. Since 2006, Iowa has had in place a retailer&#8217;s incentive for blended fuel which has been modified over time. For 2013 through 2017, retailers earn $0.045 per gallon of B5. Iowa also has a biomass-based diesel production incentive that provides $0.02 per gallon of production capped after the first 25 million gallons per production plant. Iowa recently enacted an increase in its excise tax on fuel, which is three cents per gallon less for B11 or higher blends than the diesel fuel tax. In Texas, the biomass-based diesel portion of biomass-based diesel blends are exempt from state excise tax, which results in a $0.20 per gallon incentive for B100. In addition, regulatory changes in 2012 by the Texas Department of Revenue and Texas Commission on Environmental Equality have removed regulatory barriers and eliminated limitations to blending biomass-based diesel under the Texas Low Emissions Diesel program. In addition, California has adopted a low carbon fuel standard, which requires an increasing reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels, which has created an incentive for the use of lower carbon intensity biomass-based diesel. In addition, Oregon and Washington state have been in the process of developing and implementing their own low carbon fuel programs. Oregon is currently engaged in the rulemaking process. 

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 40 states have implemented various programs that encourage the use of biomass-based diesel through blending requirements as well as various tax incentives. Currently, Minnesota law requires a B5 biodiesel blend throughout the entire year. In 2014, the law required the state to increase blends to a B10 blend in the summer months. Oregon has implemented a B5 biodiesel blend requirement. New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Washington have all adopted legislation requiring biomass-based diesel blends beginning at B2 (and B5 in New Mexico) with incremental increases, provided certain feedstock or production minimums are met. Several northeast states, including Connecticut and Vermont, have adopted legislation requiring biomass-based diesel blends in home heating oil. The City of New York has adopted legislation requiring biomass-based diesel blends at a 2% rate for heating oil and legislation increasing that requirement to B5 biodiesel has been introduced. 

Although we believe that state requirements for the use of biofuels increase demand for our biomass-based diesel within such states, they may not increase overall demand in excess of RFS2 requirements. Rather, existing demand for our biofuel from Obligated Parties in connection with federal requirements may shift to states that have use requirements or tax incentive programs. 

Environmental Matters 

Our manufacturing facilities, like other fuel and chemical production facilities, are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground; the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; ecological and natural resources; and the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the public. These laws and regulations require us to obtain and comply with numerous environmental permits to construct and operate each facility. They can require expensive pollution control equipment 

or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to human health and the environment. A violation of these laws, regulations or permit conditions could result in substantial fines, natural resource damage, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and or facility shutdowns. We do not currently have any environmental proceedings either pending or threatened against our facilities that would materially affect our business or financial condition. Furthermore, we do not anticipate a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition as a result of our efforts to comply with these requirements as presently in effect. 

History

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 597 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 

Intellectual Property 

We own a significant number of U.S. and international patents, trade secrets, and licenses related to our biomass-based diesel and industrial biotechnology businesses and expect that number to grow as we continue to pursue technological innovations. We have developed a patented technology that uses microbes to convert sugars to biodiesel in an one-step fermentation process similar to ethanol manufacturing. We have an estate of issued patents offering protection through 2034 and additional patent applications in prosecution that if issued will extend patent protections beyond 2034. 

Customer concentration 

Our sales to one customer, Pilot Travel Centers LLC, or Pilot, were $114.0 million, $231.8 million and $243.3 million, representing approximately 8%, 18% and 16% of our total revenues for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Our revenues from Pilot generally do not include the RINs associated with the gallons of biomass-based diesel sold. The value of those RINs represented approximately an additional 13% of our total sales in 2015, based on the OPIS average RIN price for the year. 

Research and development 

We devote considerable resources to our research and development programs. Our biomass-based diesel research and development programs have been primarily targeted towards improving the quality and efficiency of the biomass-based diesel production process and developing applications for co-products. Our development stage industrial biotechnology business conducts research and development involving the production of renewable chemicals, additional advanced biofuels and other products from our proprietary microbial fermentation process. In January 2016, ExxonMobil, a global leader in advanced biofuels research, announced an agreement with us to study the production of biodiesel by fermenting renewable cellulosic sugars from sources such as agricultural waste. The agreement is between ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company and REG Life Sciences. We have developed a patented technology that uses microbes to convert sugars to biodiesel in an one-step fermentation process similar to ethanol manufacturing. 

We expect our research and development expense associated with these programs to increase in future periods. We incurred research and development expense of $16.9 million , $12.4 million, and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
