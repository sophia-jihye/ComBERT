 Item 1. Business 

The Company 

Atlantic American Corporation, a Georgia corporation incorporated in 1968 (the &#147;Parent&#148; or &#147;Company&#148;), is a holding company that operates through its subsidiaries in well-defined specialty markets within the life and health and property and casualty insurance industries. The Parent&#146;s principal operating subsidiaries are American Southern Insurance Company and American Safety Insurance Company (together known as &#147;American Southern&#148;) within the property and casualty insurance industry and Bankers Fidelity Life Insurance Company and Bankers Fidelity Assurance Company (together known as &#147;Bankers Fidelity&#148;) within the life and health insurance industry. Each of American Southern and Bankers Fidelity is managed separately based upon the type of products it offers, and is evaluated on its individual performance. The Company&#146;s strategy is to focus on well-defined geographic, demographic and/or product niches within the insurance marketplace. Each of American Southern and Bankers Fidelity operates with relative autonomy, which structure is designed to allow for quick reaction to market opportunities.

The Parent has no significant business operations of its own and relies on fees, dividends and other distributions from its operating subsidiaries as the principal source of cash flow to meet its obligations. Additional information regarding the cash flow and liquidity needs of the Parent can be found in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Property and Casualty Operations 

American Southern comprises the Company&#146;s property and casualty operations and its primary product lines are as follows:

Business Automobile Insurance policies provide bodily injury and/or property damage liability coverage, uninsured motorist coverage and physical damage coverage for commercial accounts.

General Liability Insurance policies cover bodily injury and property damage liability for both premises and completed operations exposures for general classes of business.

Surety Bonds are contracts under which one party, the insurance company issuing the surety bond, guarantees to a third party that the primary party will fulfill an obligation in accordance with a contractual agreement. This obligation may involve meeting a contractual commitment, paying a debt or performing certain duties.

American Southern provides tailored business automobile insurance coverage, on a multi-year contract basis, to state governments, local municipalities and other large motor pools and fleets (&#147;block accounts&#148;) that can be specifically rated and underwritten. The size of the block accounts insured by American Southern are generally such that individual class experience can be determined, which allows for customized policy terms and rates. American Southern is licensed to do business in 32 states and the District of Columbia. While the majority of American Southern&#146;s premiums are derived from its automobile lines of business, American Southern also offers business personal property, inland marine and general liability coverages. Additionally, American Southern directly provides surety bond coverage for school bus transportation and subdivision construction, as well as performance and payment bonds.

The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, the allocation of American Southern&#146;s net earned premiums from each of its principal product lines:

Life Insurance products include non-participating individual term and whole life insurance policies with a variety of riders and options. Policy premiums are dependent upon a number of factors, including issue age, level of coverage and selected riders or options.

Medicare Supplement Insurance includes 8 of the 11 standardized Medicare supplement policies created under the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (&#147;MIPPA&#148;), which are designed to provide insurance coverage for certain expenses not covered by the Medicare program, including copayments and deductibles.

Other Accident and Health Insurance coverages include several policies providing for the payment of standard benefits in connection with the treatment of diagnosed cancer and other critical illnesses, as well as a number of other policies providing nursing facility care, accident expense, hospital indemnity and disability coverages.

Marketing 

Property and Casualty Operations 

A portion of American Southern&#146;s business is marketed through a small number of specialized, experienced independent agents. American Southern&#146;s agent selection process is actively managed by internal marketing personnel with oversight from management. Senior management carefully reviews all new programs prior to acceptance. Most of American Southern&#146;s agents are paid an up-front commission with the potential for 

additional commissions by participating in a profit sharing arrangement that is directly linked to the profitability of the underlying business. American Southern also solicits business from governmental entities. As an experienced writer of insurance policies for certain governmental programs, the company actively pursues this market on a direct basis. Much of this business is priced by means of competitive bid situations and there can be no assurance with respect to ultimate profitability or that the company can obtain or retain such business at the time of a specific contract renewal.

Life and Health Operations 

Bankers Fidelity markets its policies through three distribution channels all of which utilize commissioned, independent agents. The three channels utilized include traditional independent agents, broker-agents typically interested in a specific product of Bankers Fidelity and special market agents who promote workplace, association and/or branded products.

Bankers Fidelity has implemented an agent qualification process and had 3,447 licensed agents as of December 31, 2015. The agents generally concentrate their sales activities in both the accident and health or life insurance product lines. During 2015, approximately 872 of the licensed agents wrote policies on behalf of Bankers Fidelity.

Bankers Fidelity, in an effort to motivate all of its licensed agents to market its products, offers the following: competitive products and commission structures, efficient claims service, prompt payment of commissions that vest immediately, simplified policy issuance procedures, periodic sales incentive programs and, as described below, for traditional independent agents, protected sales territories determined based on specific counties and/or zip codes.

In the traditional independent agent arrangement, Bankers Fidelity enters into contractual arrangements with various regional sales directors and general agents responsible for marketing and other sales activities, who may also, in turn, recommend appointment of other independent agents. The standard agreements set forth the commission arrangements and are terminable without cause by either party upon notice. Regional sales directors and general agents receive an override commission on sales made by their sponsored agents. Management believes utilizing experienced agents, as well as independent general agents who recruit and train their own agents, is cost effective. All independent agents are compensated primarily on a commission basis. Using independent agents also enables Bankers Fidelity to effectively expand or contract its sales force without incurring significant expense.

With the traditional independent agents, the company utilizes a lead generation system that rewards qualified agents with leads in accordance with certain production criteria. In addition, a protected territory is established for qualified agents, which entitles them to all leads produced within that territory. The territories are zip code or county based and encompass sufficient geographic territory designed to produce an economically serviceable senior population. The Company believes that offering a lead generation system solves an agent&#146;s most important dilemma -- prospecting -- and allows Bankers Fidelity to build long-term relationships with agents who view Bankers Fidelity as their primary company. In addition, management believes that Bankers Fidelity&#146;s product line is less sensitive to competitor pricing and commissions because of the perceived value of the protected territory and the lead generation system. In protected geographical areas, production per agent has historically compared favorably to unprotected areas served by the general brokerage division.

Products of Bankers Fidelity compete directly with products offered by other insurance companies, and agents may represent multiple insurance companies. Broker-agents generally are not interested in developing relationships with any one particular insurance company but are more interested in matching a specific product with the specific needs of their clients. These agents, while a source of business, do not participate in the company&#146;s lead generation system, but can qualify for other incentives that Bankers Fidelity offers to its traditional independent agents.

Bankers Fidelity also has a number of agents, some of whom belong to marketing organizations that solicit business from various groups including employers, trade associations and/or other organizations. Depending on the group&#146;s needs, these agents may target one specific product or a group of Bankers Fidelity&#146;s products to market to a group&#146;s members. These agents also do not participate in the company&#146;s lead generation system, but can also qualify for other incentives that Bankers Fidelity offers to its traditional independent agents.

Underwriting 

Property and Casualty Operations 

American Southern specializes in underwriting various risks that are sufficiently large enough to establish separate class experience, relying upon the underwriting expertise of its agents.

During the course of the policy life, extensive use is made of risk management representatives to assist commercial underwriters in identifying and correcting potential loss exposures and to physically inspect new accounts. The underwriting results from each insured are reviewed on an individual basis periodically. When results are below expectations, management takes corrective action which may include adjusting rates, revising underwriting standards, adjusting commissions paid to agents, and/or altering or declining to renew accounts at expiration.

Life and Health Operations 

Bankers Fidelity issues a variety of products for both life and health insurance markets, with a focus on senior life insurance products typically with small face amounts of between $3,000 and $50,000, and Medicare supplement insurance. The majority of its products utilize &#147;Yes&#148; or &#147;No&#148; applications that are underwritten on a non-medical basis. Bankers Fidelity offers products to all age groups; however, its primary marketing focus is the senior market which is generally defined as individuals 65 years of age or older. For life products offered to other than the senior market, Bankers Fidelity may require medical information, such as medical examinations, subject to published age guidelines and coverage limits. Approximately 89% of the annualized premiums for both life and health insurance sold during 2015 were derived from insurance written on a non-medical basis. For the senior market, Bankers Fidelity offers life products primarily on a simplified policy issue basis with coverage amounts up to $50,000 for preferred rates, up to $35,000 for standard rates and up to $20,000 for graded death benefits and modified rates. Bankers Fidelity retains a maximum coverage amount of $100,000 with respect to any individual life policy (see &#147;Reinsurance&#148;). 

Applications for insurance are reviewed to determine the face amount, age, medical history and any other necessary information. Bankers Fidelity utilizes information obtained directly from the insured, the Medical Information Bureau (&#147;M.I.B.&#148;), paramedical testing, and/or medical records. Bankers Fidelity may also utilize investigative services to supplement and substantiate information. For certain limited coverages, Bankers Fidelity has adopted simplified policy issuance procedures by which an application containing a variety of health related questions is submitted. For these plans, Bankers Fidelity obtains M.I.B. and prescription drug utilization reports and conducts a telephone interview, however, will generally not request paramedical testing or medical records. 

Policyholder and Claims Services 

The Company believes that prompt, efficient policyholder and claims services are essential to its continued success in marketing its insurance products (see &#147;Competition&#148;). Additionally, the Company believes that its insureds are particularly sensitive to claims processing time and to the accessibility of qualified staff to answer inquiries. Accordingly, the Company&#146;s policyholder and claims services seek to offer expeditious disposition of service requests by providing toll-free access for all customers, 24-hour claim reporting services, and direct computer links with some of its largest accounts. The Company also utilizes an automatic call distribution system to ensure that inbound calls to customer service support groups are processed efficiently. Operational data generated from this system allows management to further refine ongoing client service programs and service representative training modules.

Property and Casualty Operations 

American Southern controls its claims costs by utilizing an in-house staff of claims supervisors to investigate, verify, negotiate and settle claims. Upon notification of an occurrence purportedly giving rise to a claim, a claim file is established. The claims department then conducts a preliminary investigation, determines whether an insurable event has occurred and, if so, updates the file for the findings and any required reserve adjustments. Frequently, independent adjusters and appraisers are utilized to service claims which require on-site inspections. 

Life and Health Operations 

Insureds may obtain claim forms by calling the claims department customer service group or through Bankers Fidelity&#146;s website. To shorten claim processing time, a letter detailing all supporting documents that are 

required to complete a claim for a particular policy is sent to the customer along with the correct claim form. With respect to life policies, the claim is entered into Bankers Fidelity&#146;s claims system when the proper documentation is received. Properly documented claims are generally paid within five business days of receipt. With regard to Medicare supplement policies, the claim is either directly billed to Bankers Fidelity by the provider or sent electronically through a Medicare clearing house.

(1) Favorable loss development from life and health operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $0.7 million and $0.3 million, respectively. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Reserves are set by line of business within each of the subsidiaries. At December 31, 2015, approximately 80% of the reserves related to property and casualty losses and approximately 20% related to life and health losses. The Company&#146;s property and casualty operations incur losses which may take extended periods of time to evaluate and settle. Issues with respect to legal liability, actual loss quantification, legal discovery and ultimate subrogation, among other factors, may influence the initial and subsequent estimates of loss. In the property and casualty operations, the Company&#146;s general practice is to reserve at the higher end of the determined reasonable range of loss if no other value within the range is determined to be more probable. The Company&#146;s life and health operations generally incur losses which are more readily quantified. Medical claims received are recorded in case reserves based on contractual terms using the submitted billings as a basis for determination. Life claims are recorded based on contract value at the time of notification to the Company; although policy reserves related to such contracts have been previously established. Individual case reserves are established by a claims processor on each individual claim and are periodically reviewed and adjusted as new information becomes known during the course of handling a claim. Regular internal periodic reviews are also performed by management to ensure that loss reserves are established and revised timely relative to the receipt of new or additional information. Lines of business for which loss data (e.g. paid losses and case reserves) emerge over a long period of time are referred to as long-tail lines of business. Lines of business for which loss data emerge more quickly are referred to as short-tail lines of business. The Company&#146;s long-tail line of business generally consists of its general liability coverage while the short-tail lines of business generally consist of property and automobile coverages. 

The Company&#146;s actuaries regularly review reserves for both current and prior accident years using the most current claims data. These reviews incorporate a variety of actuarial methods (discussed in Critical Accounting 

Policies) and judgments and involve a disciplined analysis. For most lines of business, certain actuarial methods and specific assumptions are deemed more appropriate based on the current circumstances affecting that line of business. These selections incorporate input from claims personnel and operating management on reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates. 

For long-tail lines of business, the emergence of paid losses and case reserves is less credible in the early periods, and accordingly may not be indicative of ultimate losses. For these lines, methods which incorporate a development pattern assumption are given less weight in calculating incurred but not reported (&#147;IBNR&#148;) reserves for the early periods of loss emergence because such a low percentage of ultimate losses are reported in that time frame. Accordingly, for any given accident year, the rate at which losses on long-tail lines of business emerge in the early periods is generally not as reliable an indication of ultimate losses as it would be for shorter-tail lines of business. The estimation of reserves for these lines of business in the early periods of loss emergence is therefore largely influenced by statistical analyses and application of prior accident years&#146; loss ratios, after considering changes to earned pricing, loss costs, mix of business, ceded reinsurance and other factors that are expected to affect the estimated ultimate losses. For later periods of loss emergence, methods which incorporate a development pattern assumption are given more weight in estimating ultimate losses. For short-tail lines of business, the emergence of paid loss and case reserves is more credible in the early periods and is more likely to be indicative of ultimate losses. The method used to set reserves for these lines of business is based upon utilization of a historical development pattern for reported losses. IBNR reserves for the current year are set as the difference between the estimated fully developed ultimate losses for each year, less the established, related case reserves and cumulative related payments. IBNR reserves for prior accident years are similarly determined, again relying on an indicated, historical development pattern for reported losses. 

Based on the results of regular reserve estimate reviews, the Company determines the appropriate reserve adjustment, if any, to record in each period. If necessary, recorded reserve estimates are changed after consideration of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves, improvement or deterioration of actuarial indication in the period, the maturity of the accident year, trends observed over the recent past and the level of volatility within a particular line of business. In general, changes are made more quickly to recognize changes in estimates to ultimate losses in mature accident years and less volatile lines of business. 

Estimating case reserves and ultimate losses involves various considerations which differ according to the line of business. In addition, changes in legislative and regulatory environments may impact loss estimates. General liability claims may have a long pattern of loss emergence. Given the broad nature of potential general liability coverages, investigative time periods may be extended and questions of coverage may exist. Such uncertainties create greater imprecision in estimating required levels of loss reserves. The property and automobile lines of business generally have less variable reserve estimates than other lines. This is largely due to the coverages having relatively shorter periods of loss emergence. Estimates, however, can still vary due to a number of factors, including interpretations of frequency and severity trends. Severity trends can be impacted by changes in internal claim handling and reserving practices in addition to changes in the external environment. These changes in claim practices increase the uncertainty in the interpretation of case reserve data, which increases the uncertainty in recorded reserve levels.

The Company&#146;s policy is to record reserves for losses and claims in amounts which approximate actuarial best estimates of ultimate values. Actuarial best estimates do not necessarily represent the midpoint value determined using the various actuarial methods; however, such estimates will fall between the estimated low and high end reserve values. The range of estimates developed in connection with the December 31, 2015 actuarial review indicated that reserves could be as much as 13.8% lower or as much as 6.0% higher. In the opinion of management, recorded reserves represent the best estimate of outstanding losses, although significant judgments are made in the derivation of reserve estimates and revisions to such estimates are expected to be made in future periods. Any such revisions could be material, and may materially adversely affect the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations in any future period. 

Property and Casualty Operations 

American Southern maintains loss reserves representing estimates of amounts necessary for payment of losses and LAE, and which are not discounted. IBNR reserves are also maintained for future development. These loss reserves are estimates, based on known facts and circumstances at a given date, of amounts the Company expects to pay on incurred claims. All balances are reviewed periodically by the Company&#146;s independent consulting actuary. Reserves for LAE are intended to cover the ultimate costs of settling claims, including investigation and defense of any lawsuits resulting from such claims. Loss reserves for reported claims are based on a case-by-case evaluation of the type of claim involved, the circumstances surrounding the claim, and the policy provisions relating to the type of loss along with anticipated future development. The LAE for claims reported and claims not reported is based on historical statistical data and anticipated future development. Inflation and other factors which may affect claim payments are implicitly reflected in the reserving process through analysis and consideration of cost trends and reviews of historical reserve results. 

American Southern establishes reserves for claims based upon: (a) management&#146;s estimate of ultimate liability and claims adjusters&#146; evaluations of unpaid claims reported prior to the close of the accounting period, (b) estimates of IBNR claims based on past experience, and (c) estimates of LAE. If no value is determined to be more probable in estimating a loss after considering all factors, the Company&#146;s general practice is to reserve at the higher end of the determined reasonable range of loss. The estimated liability is periodically reviewed and updated, and changes to the estimated liability are recorded in the statement of operations in the period in which such changes become known. 

The following table sets forth the development of reserves for unpaid losses and claims determined using generally accepted accounting principles of American Southern&#146;s insurance lines from 2005 through 2015. Specifically excluded from the table are the life and health division&#146;s claims reserves, which are included in the consolidated loss and claims reserves. The top line of the table represents the estimated cumulative amount of losses and LAE for claims arising in all prior years that were unpaid at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated periods, including an estimate of IBNR losses at the applicable date. The amounts represent initial reserve estimates at the respective balance sheet dates for the current and all prior years. The next portion of the table shows the cumulative amounts paid with respect to claims in each succeeding year. The lower portion of the table shows the re-estimated amounts of previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. 

The reserve estimates are modified as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years. The &#147;cumulative redundancy&#148; for each year represents the aggregate change in such year&#146;s estimates through the end of 2015. Furthermore, the amount of the redundancy for any year represents the cumulative amount of the changes from initial reserve estimates for such year. Operations for any year may be affected, favorably or unfavorably, by the amount of the change in the estimate for such years; however, because such analysis is based on the reserves for unpaid losses and claims, before consideration of reinsurance, the total indicated redundancies may not ultimately be reflected in the Company&#146;s net income. Further, conditions and 

trends that have affected development of reserves in the past may not necessarily occur in the future and there could be future events or actions that impact future development which have not existed in the past. Accordingly, the accurate prediction of future redundancies based on the data in the following table is not possible.

Note: This analysis is based on reserves for unpaid losses and claims, before consideration of reinsurance; therefore the total indicated redundancies may not ultimately be reflected in the Company&#146;s net income. 

Life and Health Operations 

Bankers Fidelity establishes liabilities for future policy benefits to meet projected future obligations under outstanding policies. These reserves are calculated to satisfy policy and contract obligations as they mature. The amount of reserves for insurance policies is calculated using assumptions for interest rates, mortality and morbidity rates, expenses, and withdrawals. Reserves are adjusted periodically based on published actuarial tables with modifications to reflect actual experience. The use of significantly different assumptions, or actual results that differ significantly from our estimates, could materially adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations or financial condition. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reinsurance 

The Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries from time to time purchase reinsurance from unaffiliated insurers and reinsurers to reduce their potential liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses. In a reinsurance transaction, an insurance company transfers, or &#147;cedes,&#148; a portion or all of its exposure on insurance policies to a reinsurer. The reinsurer assumes the exposure in return for a portion of the premiums. The ceding of insurance does not legally discharge the insurer from primary liability for the full amount of the policies written by it, and the ceding company will incur a loss if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement.

Property and Casualty Operations 

American Southern&#146;s basic reinsurance treaties generally cover all claims in excess of specified per occurrence limitations. Limits per occurrence within the reinsurance treaties are as follows: Fire - $125,000 excess of $50,000 retention; Inland marine and commercial automobile physical damage - $125,000 excess of $75,000 retention; and automobile liability and general liability - excess coverage of $2.0 million less retentions that may vary from $100,000 to $150,000 depending on the account. American Southern maintains a property catastrophe treaty with a $5.7 million limit excess of $300,000 retention. American Southern also issues individual surety bonds with face amounts generally up to $1.5 million, and limited to $5.0 million in aggregate per account, that are not reinsured.

Life and Health Operations 

Bankers Fidelity has entered into reinsurance contracts ceding the excess of its retention to several primary reinsurers. Maximum retention by Bankers Fidelity on any one individual in the case of life insurance policies is $100,000. At December 31, 2015, $16.8 million of the $267.2 million of life insurance in force at Bankers Fidelity was reinsured under a mix of coinsurance and yearly renewable term agreements. Certain prior year reinsurance agreements also remain in force although they no longer provide reinsurance for new business.

Competition 

Competition for insurance products is based on many factors including premiums charged, terms and conditions of coverage, service provided, financial ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, claims services, reputation, perceived financial strength and the experience of the organization in the line of business being written.

Property and Casualty Operations 

The businesses in which American Southern engages are highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing and service. Many competing property and casualty companies, which have been in business longer than American Southern, offer more diversified lines of insurance and have substantially greater financial resources. Management believes, however, that the policies it sells are competitive with those providing similar benefits offered by other insurers doing business in the states in which American Southern operates. American Southern attempts to develop strong relationships with its agents and, consequently, believes it is better positioned for new opportunities and programs with those agents.

Life and Health Operations 

The life and health insurance business also remains highly competitive and includes a large number of insurance companies, many of which have substantially greater financial resources than Bankers Fidelity or the Company. Bankers Fidelity offers life insurance products, Medicare supplement and other accident and health insurance products with a focus on the senior market. Bankers Fidelity believes that its primary competitors are Americo Life, GTL, Lincoln Heritage, Medico, Monumental, Mutual of Omaha, New Era, Standard Life, Transamerica and United Healthcare. Bankers Fidelity competes with these as well as other insurers on the basis of premium rates, policy benefits and service to policyholders. Bankers Fidelity also competes with other insurers to attract and retain the allegiance of its independent agents through commission and sales incentive arrangements, accessibility and marketing assistance, lead programs, reputation, and market expertise. In order to better compete, Bankers Fidelity actively seeks opportunities in niche markets, developing long-term relationships with a select number of independent marketing organizations promoting worksite marketing and selective association endorsements. Bankers Fidelity has a track record of successfully competing in its chosen markets by establishing relationships with independent agents and providing proprietary marketing initiatives as well as providing outstanding service to policyholders. Bankers Fidelity believes that it competes effectively on the bases of policy benefits, services and market segmentation.

Ratings 

Ratings of insurance companies are not designed for investors and do not constitute recommendations to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings are important measures within the insurance industry, and higher ratings should have a favorable impact on the ability of a company to compete in the marketplace.

Each year A.M. Best Company, Inc. (&#147;A.M. Best&#148;) publishes Best&#146;s Insurance Reports, which includes assessments and ratings of all insurance companies. A.M. Best&#146;s ratings, which may be revised quarterly, fall into fifteen categories ranging from A++ (Superior) to F (in liquidation). A.M. Best&#146;s ratings are based on a detailed analysis of the statutory financial condition and operations of an insurance company compared to the industry in general.

American Southern. American Southern Insurance Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, American Safety Insurance Company, are each, as of the date of this report, rated &#147;A&#148; (Excellent) by A.M. Best.

Bankers Fidelity. Bankers Fidelity Life Insurance Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bankers Fidelity Assurance Company, are each, as of the date of this report, rated &#147;A-&#148; (Excellent) by A.M. Best.

Regulation 

In common with all domestic insurance companies, the Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business. Statutes typically delegate regulatory, supervisory, and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners. The method of such regulation varies, but regulation relates generally to the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, approval of policy forms, reserve requirements, the standards of solvency to be met and maintained, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, and periodic examinations of insurers and trade practices, among other things. The Company&#146;s products generally are subject to rate regulation by state insurance commissions, which require that certain minimum loss ratios be maintained. Certain states also have insurance holding company laws which require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies controlled by other corporations licensed to transact business within their respective jurisdictions. The Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries are subject to such legislation and are registered as controlled insurers in those jurisdictions in which such registration is required. Such laws vary from state to state, but typically require periodic disclosure concerning the corporation which controls the registered insurers and all subsidiaries of such corporations, as well as prior notice to, or approval by, the state insurance commissioners of intercorporate transfers of assets (including payments of dividends by the insurance subsidiaries in excess of specified amounts) within the holding company system.

Most states require that rate schedules and other information be filed with the state&#146;s insurance regulatory authority, either directly or through a ratings organization with which the insurer is affiliated. The regulatory authority may disapprove a rate filing if it determines that the rates are inadequate, excessive, or discriminatory. The Company has historically experienced no significant regulatory resistance to its applications for rate adjustments; however, the Company cannot provide any assurance that it will not receive any objections to any applications in the future.

A state may require that acceptable securities be deposited for the protection either of policyholders located in those states or of all policyholders. As of December 31, 2015, securities with an amortized cost of $11.3 million were on deposit either directly with various state authorities or with third parties pursuant to various custodial agreements on behalf of the Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries.

Virtually all of the states in which the Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business require participation in their respective guaranty funds designed to cover claims against insolvent insurers. Insurers authorized to transact business in these jurisdictions are generally subject to assessments of up to 4% of annual direct premiums written in that jurisdiction to pay such claims, if any. The likelihood and amount of any future assessments cannot be estimated until an insolvency has occurred.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the &#147;NAIC&#148;) was established to, among other things, provide guidelines to assess the financial strength of insurance companies for state regulatory purposes. The NAIC conducts annual reviews of the financial data of insurance companies primarily through the application of 13 financial ratios prepared on a statutory basis. The annual statements are submitted to state insurance departments to assist them in monitoring insurance companies in their state and to set forth a desirable range in which companies should fall in each such ratio.

The NAIC suggests that insurance companies which fall outside of the &#147;usual&#148; range in four or more financial ratios are those most likely to require analysis by state regulators. However, according to the NAIC, it may not be unusual for a financially sound company to have several ratios outside the &#147;usual&#148; range.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, American Southern and Bankers Fidelity Life Insurance Company were both individually within the NAIC &#147;usual&#148; range for all 13 financial ratios. 

Risk-Based Capital 

Risk-based capital (&#147;RBC&#148;) is a metric used by ratings agencies and regulators as an early warning tool to identify weakly capitalized companies for the purpose of initiating further regulatory action. The RBC calculation determines the amount of adjusted capital needed by a company to avoid regulatory action. &#147;Authorized Control Level Risk-Based Capital&#148; (&#147;ACL&#148;) is calculated, and if a company&#146;s adjusted capital is 200% or lower than ACL, it is subject to regulatory action. At December 31, 2015, the Company&#146;s insurance subsidiaries exceeded the RBC regulatory levels.

Investments 

Investment income represents a significant portion of the Company&#146;s operating and total income. Insurance company investments are subject to state insurance laws and regulations which limit the concentration and types of investments. The following table provides information on the Company&#146;s investments as of the dates indicated.

Actual results could differ materially from those expected by the Company, depending on the occurrence or outcome of various factors. These factors include, among others: significant changes in general economic conditions; disruption to the financial markets; unanticipated increases in the rate, number and amounts of claims outstanding; the possible occurrence of terrorist attacks; the level of performance of reinsurance companies under reinsurance contracts and the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance to protect the Company against losses; changes in the stock markets, interest rates or other financial markets, including the potential effect on the Company&#146;s statutory capital levels; the uncertain effect on the Company of regulatory and market-driven changes in practices relating to the payment of incentive compensation to brokers, agents and other producers; the incidence and severity of catastrophes, both natural and man-made; stronger than anticipated competitive activity; unfavorable judicial or legislative developments; the potential effect of regulatory developments, including those which could increase the Company&#146;s business costs and required capital levels; the Company&#146;s ability to distribute its products through distribution channels, both current and future; the uncertain effect of emerging claim and coverage issues; the effect of assessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements; and risks related to cybersecurity matters, such as breaches of our computer network or the loss of unauthorized access to the data we maintain. Many of such factors are beyond the Company&#146;s ability to control or predict. As a result, the Company&#146;s actual financial condition and results of operations could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by the Company. Undue reliance should not be placed upon forward-looking statements contained herein. The Company does not intend to publicly update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time to time by, or on behalf of, the Company.
