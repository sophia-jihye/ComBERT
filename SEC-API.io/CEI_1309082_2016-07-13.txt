 ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Lucas Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is an independent oil and natural gas company based in Houston, Texas with a field office in Gonzales, Texas. Lucas Energy, Inc. (herein the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Lucas,&#8221; &#8220;Lucas Energy,&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8221;) is engaged in the acquisition and development of crude oil and natural gas from various known productive geological formations, including the Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford formations, primarily in Gonzales, Wilson and Karnes Counties, south of the city of San Antonio, Texas. Incorporated in Nevada in December 2003 under the name Panorama Investments Corp., the Company changed its name to Lucas Energy, Inc. effective June 9, 2006. All of our oil and gas interests and equipment existing as of December 16, 2015 are held by our wholly-owned Texas subsidiary, CATI Operating LLC (&#8220;CATI&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Our primary value drivers are our Eagle Ford Shale reserves which must be developed to unlock their full potential. We believe the market conditions driving us toward the need for a larger entity of greater size and financial mass are even more essential in the current environment. In order to develop the significant Eagle Ford reserves at our disposal, we believe that we must become, or become part of, a larger organization with ample cash flow and greater access to capital. Measures such as return on equity, liquidity and stock multiples have led us to conclude that the market, in general, views small-cap and mid-cap exploration and production companies as having greater potential than microcaps. The larger companies tend to have access to more favorable debt financing, receive greater analyst coverage, trade with greater liquidity and consequently, often have higher share prices. 

&#160; 

In December 2015, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, as purchaser, with twenty-one separate sellers (the &#8220;Sellers&#8221;). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire from the Sellers working interests in producing properties and undeveloped acreage in Texas and Oklahoma, including varied interests in two largely contiguous acreage blocks in the liquids-rich Mid-Continent region of the United States, and related wells, leases, records, equipment and agreements associated therewith as well as producing shale properties in Glasscock County, Texas, in consideration for, among other things, the issuance of 13,009,664 shares of common stock to the Sellers, and the issuance of 552,000 shares of to-be designated Series B Preferred Stock to one of the Sellers, upon approval of such issuances by our stockholders. If the Acquisition closes, we expect that our production will increase and it will allow us to expand our geographic footprint into the Mid-continent, re-brand our organization and redirect our strategic vision. The Asset Purchase Agreement is described in greater detail under &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Asset Purchase Agreement&#8221;, below. 

&#160; 

In April 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we issued a redeemable convertible subordinated debenture, with a face amount of $530,000, convertible into 163,077 shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to $3.25 per share and a warrant to purchase 1,384,616 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to $3.25 per share (the &#8220;First Warrant&#8221;). The debenture had a 5.0% original issue discount and we received $500,000 in connection with the sale of such debenture. The holder agreed that it will exercise the First Warrant, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, for the sum of $4.5 million. 

&#160; 

Also in April 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we agreed, subject to certain conditions, including the closing of the acquisition described above, to issue 527 shares of Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock (with a face value of $5.26 million) at a 5% original issue discount, convertible into 1,618,462 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $3.25 per share, and a warrant to purchase 1,111,112 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.50 per share. If fully funded, the sale of the securities contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement, coupled with the Securities Purchase Agreement above, would represent $14.5 million in additional funding for the Company. 

&#160; 

The Securities Purchase Agreement and Stock Purchase Agreement are described in greater detail below under &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; - &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; - &#8220;Financing&#8221;. 

&#160; 

4&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our management is focused on achieving greater stockholder value through a turbulent period. Specifically, our immediate efforts include: (i) closing the transactions described above (i.e., the acquisition and funding agreements), (ii) attempting to re-finance our current debt with some combination of new debt and equity, and (iii) considering the potential acquisition of oil and gas properties for equity; all in an effort to stabilize our company and provide an increased base of operating cash flow. Our future expectations continue to include an increase in production through development of our acreage, increased profitability margins by evaluating and optimizing our production, and executing our business plan with the goal of increasing property values, reserves, and expanding our asset base. 

&#160; 

At March 31, 2016, we had leasehold interests (working interests) in approximately 8,395 gross acres, or 8,309 net acres. Our total net developed and undeveloped acreage as measured from the surface to the base of the Austin Chalk formation was approximately 8,309 net acres. In deeper formations, we had approximately 1,909 net acres in the Eagle Ford oil window. 

&#160; 

For the year ending March 31, 2016, we produced an average of approximately 61 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boepd) from 26 active well bores, of which 10 wells accounted for more than 80% of our production. The ratio between the gross and net production varies due to varied working interests and net revenue interests in each well. We operate over 90% of our producing wells, except two wells producing from the Eagle Ford of which are being operated by an affiliate of Marathon Oil Corporation, of which we have a 15% working interest on each well. Our production sales totaled 22,190 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe), net to our interest, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. 

&#160; 

At March 31, 2016, our total estimated net proved reserves were 4.3 million Boe, of which 3.8 million barrels (Bbls) were crude oil reserves, and 2.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf) were natural gas reserves. Of these quantities, approximately 97% and 100%, respectively, are classified as proved undeveloped. 

&#160; 

As of March 31, 2016, we employed seven full-time employees. We also utilized three contractors on an &#8220;as-needed&#8221; basis to carry out various functions, including but not limited to field operations, land administration, corporate activity and information technology maintenance. We believe that our relationships with our employees are satisfactory. No employee is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 

&#160; 

We have an experienced management team with proven acquisition, operating and financing capabilities. Mr. Anthony Schnur, our Chief Executive Officer, has over twenty years of extensive oil and gas and financial management experience. He has developed strategic business plans, raised debt and equity capital, and provided asset management, cash flow forecasts, transaction modeling and development planning for both start-ups and special situations. On three separate occasions in his career, Mr. Schnur has been asked to lead work-out/turn-around initiatives in the E&#38;P space. Further, the Company&#8217;s Vice President of Asset Development (a non-executive position), Mr. Ken Sanders, is a seasoned petroleum engineer, with over thirty years of experience in both the execution of exploration and development prospects and the management of independent exploration and production companies as well as leading a publically-traded E&#38;P through a successful financial turnaround. 

&#160; 

In order to expand our operations in accordance with our business plan, we intend to hire additional employees with expertise in the areas of corporate development, petroleum engineering, geological and geophysical sciences and accounting, as well as hiring additional technical, operations and administrative staff. We are not currently able to estimate the number of employees that we will hire during the next twelve months since that number will depend upon the rate at which our operations expand and upon the extent to which we engage third parties to perform required services, and the availability of adequate funding. 

&#160; 

Reverse Stock Split 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the authorization provided by the Company&#8217;s stockholders at the Company&#8217;s March 25, 2015 annual meeting of stockholders, and in order to meet the continued listing standards of the NYSE MKT, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the filing of a Certificate of Amendment to the Company&#8217;s Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effect a 1-for-25 reverse stock split of all of the outstanding shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock which was effective on July 15, 2015 (the &#8220;Reverse Split&#8221;). The effect of the Reverse Split was to combine each 25 shares of outstanding common stock prior to the Reverse Split into one new share subsequent to the Reverse Split, with no change in authorized shares or par value per share, and to reduce the number of common stock shares outstanding from approximately 35.1 million shares to approximately 1.4 million shares (prior to rounding fractional shares up to the nearest whole share) upon the effectiveness of the Reverse Split. Proportional adjustments were also made to the conversion and exercise prices of the Company&#8217;s outstanding convertible preferred stock, warrants and stock options, and to the number of shares issued and issuable under the Company&#8217;s stock incentive plans. All issued and outstanding shares of common stock, conversion terms of preferred stock, options and warrants to purchase common stock and per share amounts contained in the financial statements incorporated herein by reference have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split for all periods presented in accordance with SAB TOPIC 4C. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Industry Segments 

&#160; 

&#160; Lucas Energy&#8217;s operations are all crude oil and natural gas exploration and production related. 

&#160; 

Operations and Oil and Gas Properties 

&#160; 

We operate in known productive areas in order to decrease geological risk. Our holdings are located in an increased area of current industry activity in Gonzales, Wilson and Karnes counties in Texas. We concentrate on three vertically adjoining formations in Gonzales, Wilson and Karnes counties: the Austin Chalk, Eagle Ford and Buda formations, listed in the order of increasing depth measuring from land surface. The development of the Eagle Ford as a high potential producing zone has heightened industry interest and success. Lucas&#8217;s acreage position is in the oil window of the Eagle Ford trend and has approximately 8,395 acres in the Gonzales, Karnes and Wilson Counties, Texas area. 

&#160; 

Austin Chalk 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s original activity started in Gonzales County by acquiring existing shut-in and stripper wells and improving production from those wells. Most of the wells had produced from the Austin Chalk. The Austin Chalk is a dense limestone, varying in thickness along its trend from approximately 200 feet to more than 800 feet. It produces by virtue of localized fractures within the formation. 

&#160; 

Eagle Ford 

&#160; 

On Lucas Energy&#8217;s leases, the Eagle Ford is a porous limestone with organic shale matter. The Eagle Ford formation directly underlies the Austin Chalk formation and is believed to be the primary source of oil and natural gas produced from the Austin Chalk. Reservoir thickness in the area of the Company&#8217;s leases varies from approximately 60 feet to 80 feet. 

&#160; 

Buda 

&#160; 

The Buda limestone underlies the Eagle Ford formation separated by a 10 foot to 20 foot inorganic shale barrier. Its thickness varies from approximately 100 feet to more than 150 feet in this area. The Buda produces from natural fractures and matrix porosity and is prospective across this whole area. 

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

We operate exclusively in the onshore United States oil and natural gas industry. Our crude oil production sales are to gatherers and marketers with national reputations. Our sales are made on a month-to-month basis, and title transfer occurs when the oil is loaded onto the purchaser&#8217;s truck. Crude oil prices realized from production sales are indexed to published posted refinery prices, and to published crude indexes with adjustments on a contract basis. 

&#160; 

Currently, any natural gas production is associated gas resulting from crude oil production and is currently very nominal. We expect that as we drill our proved undeveloped opportunities, we would have an increase in production of natural gas and natural gas liquids. 

&#160; 

We generally sell a significant portion of our oil and gas production to a relatively small number of customers. For the year ended March 31, 2016, 100% of our consolidated product revenues were attributable to Shell Trading (US) Company, our current and only customer as of March 31, 2016. We are not dependent upon any one purchaser and have alternative purchasers readily available at competitive market prices if there is disruption in services or other events that cause us to search for other ways to sell our production. 

&#160; 

We actively manage our crude oil inventory in field tanks and have engaged a marketing company to negotiate our crude and natural gas contracts. 

&#160; 

6&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We are in direct competition for properties with numerous oil and natural gas companies and partnerships exploring various areas of Texas and elsewhere. Many competitors are large, well-known oil and natural gas and/or energy companies, although no single entity dominates the industry. Many of our competitors possess greater financial and personnel resources, enabling them to identify and acquire more economically desirable energy producing properties and drilling prospects than us. Additionally, there is competition from other fuel choices to supply the energy needs of consumers and industry. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. These regulations include requiring permits for the drilling of wells; maintaining hazard prevention, health and safety plans; submitting notification and receiving permits related to the presence, use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and natural gas operations; and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities, surface plugging and abandonment of wells and the transporting of production. Our operations are also subject to various conservation matters, including the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration, while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases, which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally limiting the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. The effect of these regulations is to possibly limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. 

&#160; 

In the United States, legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to such legislation, numerous federal, state and local departments and agencies issue recommended new and extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. These laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and natural gas drilling, natural gas processing plants and production activities, increasing the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect profitability. Insomuch as new legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is common-place and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we may be unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with these laws and regulations. We consider the cost of environmental protection a necessary and manageable part of our business. We have historically been able to plan for and comply with new environmental initiatives without materially altering our operating strategies. 

&#160; 

Insurance Matters 

&#160; 

We maintain insurance coverage which we believe is reasonable per the standards of the oil and natural gas industry. It is common for companies in this industry to not insure fully against all risks associated with their operations either because such insurance is unavailable or because premium costs are considered prohibitive. A material loss not fully covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We maintain insurance at industry customary levels to limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and accidental discharges of certain prohibited substances into the environment. Such insurance might not cover the complete amount of such a claim and would not cover fines or penalties for a violation of an environmental law. 

&#160; 

Other Matters 

&#160; 

Environmental . Our exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas, including our operation of saltwater injection and disposal wells, are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations can increase the costs of planning, designing, installing and operating oil, natural gas, and disposal wells. Our domestic activities are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Air Act (CAA), and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), as well as state regulations promulgated under comparable state statutes. We are also subject to regulations governing the handling, transportation, storage, and disposal of naturally occurring radioactive materials that are found in our oil and gas operations. Civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with these environmental laws and regulations. Additionally, these laws and regulations require the acquisition of permits or other governmental authorizations before undertaking certain activities, limit or prohibit other activities because of protected areas or species, and impose substantial liabilities for cleanup of pollution. 

&#160; 

7&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Under the OPA, a release of oil into water or other areas designated by the statute could result in us being held responsible for the costs of remediating such a release, certain OPA specified damages, and natural resource damages. The extent of that liability could be extensive, as set forth in the statute, depending on the nature of the release. A release of oil in harmful quantities or other materials into water or other specified areas could also result in us being held responsible under the CWA for the costs of remediation, and civil and criminal fines and penalties. 

&#160; 

CERCLA and comparable state statutes, also known as &#8220;Superfund&#8221; laws, can impose joint and several and retroactive liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons for the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. In practice, cleanup costs are usually allocated among various responsible parties. Potentially liable parties include site owners or operators, past owners or operators under certain conditions, and entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of, or transport hazardous substances found at the site. Although CERCLA, as amended, currently exempts petroleum, including but not limited to, crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, from the definition of hazardous substance, our operations may involve the use or handling of other materials that may be classified as hazardous substances under CERCLA. Furthermore, the exemption may not be preserved in future amendments of the act, if any. 

&#160; 

RCRA and comparable state and local requirements impose standards for the management, including treatment, storage, and disposal, of both hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes. We generate hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste in connection with our routine operations. From time to time, proposals have been made that would reclassify certain oil and natural gas wastes, including wastes generated during drilling, production and pipeline operations, as &#8220;hazardous wastes&#8221; under RCRA, which would make such solid wastes subject to much more stringent handling, transportation, storage, disposal, and clean-up requirements. This development could have a significant impact on our operating costs. While state laws vary on this issue, state initiatives to further regulate oil and natural gas wastes could have a similar impact. Because oil and natural gas exploration and production, and possibly other activities, have been conducted at some of our properties by previous owners and operators, materials from these operations remain on some of the properties and in some instances, require remediation. In addition, in certain instances, we have agreed to indemnify sellers of producing properties from which we have acquired reserves against certain liabilities for environmental claims associated with such properties. While we do not believe that costs to be incurred by us for compliance and remediating previously or currently owned or operated properties will be material, there can be no guarantee that such costs will not result in material expenditures. 

&#160; 

Additionally, in the course of our routine oil and natural gas operations, surface spills and leaks, including casing leaks, of oil or other materials occur, and we incur costs for waste handling and environmental compliance. Moreover, we are able to control directly the operations of only those wells for which we act as the operator. Management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

In response to liabilities associated with these activities, accruals are established when reasonable estimates are possible. Such accruals would primarily include estimated costs associated with remediation. We have used discounting to present value in determining our accrued liabilities for environmental remediation or well closure, but no material claims for possible recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to environmental costs have been recognized in our financial statements. We adjust the accruals when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and probable costs become estimable, or when current remediation estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information. 

&#160; 

We do not anticipate being required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to our total capital expenditures program by reason of environmental laws and regulations, but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance. More stringent laws and regulations protecting the environment may be adopted in the future and we may incur material expenses in connection with environmental laws and regulations in the future. 

&#160; 

Occupational Health and Safety. We are also subject to laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health. Due to the continued changes in these laws and regulations, and the judicial construction of many of them, we are unable to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future costs of complying with these laws and regulations. We consider the cost of safety and health compliance a necessary and manageable part of our business. We have been able to plan for and comply with new initiatives without materially altering our operating strategies. 

&#160; 

8&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Hydraulic Fracturing. Vast quantities of natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil deposits exist in deep shale and other unconventional formations. It is customary in our industry to recover these resources through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with horizontal drilling. Hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks, or fractures, in deep underground formations using water, sand and other additives pumped under high pressure into the formation. As with the rest of the industry, we use hydraulic fracturing as a means to increase the productivity of almost every well that we drill and complete. These formations are generally geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by thousands of feet of impermeable rock layers. We follow applicable legal requirements for groundwater protection in our operations that are subject to supervision by state and federal regulators (including the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) on federal acreage). Furthermore, our well construction practices require the installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers by preventing the migration of fracturing fluids into aquifers. 

&#160; 

Injection rates and pressures are required to be monitored in real time at the surface during our hydraulic fracturing operations. Pressure is required to be monitored on both the injection string and the immediate annulus to the injection string. Hydraulic fracturing operations are required to be shut down if an abrupt change occurs to the injection pressure or annular pressure. These aspects of hydraulic fracturing operations are designed to prevent a pathway for the fracturing fluid to contact any aquifers during the hydraulic fracturing operations. 

&#160; 

Hydraulic fracture stimulation requires the use of water. We use fresh water or recycled produced water in our fracturing treatments in accordance with applicable water management plans and laws. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that impose disclosure requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Some states, such as Texas, mandate disclosure of chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing. The EPA also has commenced a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on drinking water resources, with a progress report released in late 2012 and a final draft report was released for public comment and peer review in June 2015. In addition, the BLM published a revised draft of proposed rules that would impose new requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations conducted on federal and tribal lands, including the disclosure of chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations. EPA&#8217;s guidance, the EPA&#8217;s pending study, BLM&#8217;s proposed rules, and other analyses by federal and state agencies to assess the impacts of hydraulic fracturing could each spur further action toward federal and/or state legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities. 

&#160; 

Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could make it prohibitive to conduct our operations, and also reduce the amount of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities from our properties. 

&#160; 

The Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) restricts activities that may affect areas that contain endangered or threatened species or their habitats. While some of our assets and lease acreage may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species in areas where we intend to conduct construction activity could materially limit or delay our plans. 

&#160; 

Global Warming and Climate Change. Various state governments and regional organizations are considering enacting new legislation and promulgating new regulations governing or restricting the emission of greenhouse gases from stationary sources such as our equipment and operations. Legislative and regulatory proposals for restricting greenhouse gas emissions or otherwise addressing climate change could require us to incur additional operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the natural gas and oil that we sell. The potential increase in our operating costs could include new or increased costs to obtain permits, operate and maintain our equipment and facilities, install new emission controls on our equipment and facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our greenhouse gas emissions, pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. 

&#160; 

Taxation. Our operations, as is the case in the petroleum industry generally, are significantly affected by federal tax laws. Federal, as well as state, tax laws have many provisions applicable to corporations which could affect our future tax liabilities. 

&#160; 

9&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Commitments and Contingencies. We are liable for future restoration and abandonment costs associated with our oil and gas properties. These costs include future site restoration, post closure and other environmental exit costs. The costs of future restoration and well abandonment have not been determined in detail. State regulations require operators to post bonds that assure that well sites will be properly plugged and abandoned. We currently operate only in Texas, which requires a security bond based on the number of wells we operate. Management views this as a necessary requirement for operations and does not believe that these costs will have a material adverse effect on our financial position as a result of this requirement.
