Business 

Overview 

Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; refer to First Foundation Inc., a Delaware corporation, (&#8220;FFI&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) and its consolidated subsidiaries, First Foundation Advisors (&#8220;FFA&#8221;) and First Foundation Bank (&#8220;FFB&#8221; or &#8220;Bank&#8221;), and FFB&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, First Foundation Insurance Services (&#8220;FFIS&#8221;). 

We are a California based financial services company that provides a comprehensive platform of personalized financial services to high net-worth individuals and their families, family businesses and other affiliated organizations. We consider high net-worth individuals to be individuals with net worth, excluding their primary residence, of over $1.0 million. Our integrated platform provides investment management, wealth planning, consulting, trust, banking products and services, life insurance services and property and casualty insurance services to effectively and efficiently meet the financial needs of our clients. We have also established a lending platform that offers loans to individuals and entities that own and operate multifamily residential and commercial real estate properties. In addition, we provide business banking products and services to small to moderate-sized businesses and professional firms, and consumer banking products and services to individuals and families who would not be considered high net-worth. As of December 31, 2015, we had $3.47 billion of assets under management (or AUM), $2.59 billion of total assets, $1.77 billion of loans and $1.57 billion of deposits. Our investment management, wealth planning, consulting, and trust services provide us with substantial, fee-based, recurring revenues, such that in 2015, our non-interest income was 35% of our total revenues. 

Our strategy is focused on expanding our strong and stable client relationships by delivering high quality, coordinated investment management, wealth planning, consulting, trust and banking products and services. We are able to maintain a client-focused approach by recruiting and retaining experienced and qualified staff, including highly qualified relationship managers, bankers and financial planners. 

We intend to continue to grow our business by (i) cross-selling our services among our wealth management and banking clients; (ii) obtaining new client referrals from existing clients, attorney and accountant referral sources and through referral agreements with asset custodial firms; (iii) marketing our services directly to prospective new clients; (iv) adding experienced relationship managers and bankers who may have established client relationships that we can serve; (v) establishing de novo offices in select markets, both within and outside our existing market areas; and (vi) making opportunistic acquisitions of complementary businesses. 

As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221; or &#8220;FRB&#8221;) and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (&#8220;FRBSF&#8221;) under delegated authority from the FRB. As an Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) insured, California state chartered bank, FFB is subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC and the California Department of Business Oversight (&#8220;DBO&#8221;). FFB also is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;), which provides it with a source of funds in the form of short-term and long-term borrowings. FFA is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, (&#8220;Investment Advisers Act&#8221;), and is subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, (&#8220;SEC&#8221;), under that Act. 

On October 28, 2015, we changed our state of incorporation from California to Delaware. Other than the change in corporate domicile, the reincorporation did not result in any change in the business, physical location, management, assets, liabilities or total shareholders&#8217; equity of the Company, nor did it result in any change in location of the Company&#8217;s employees, including the Company&#8217;s management. Additionally, the reincorporation did not alter any shareholder&#8217;s percentage ownership interest or number of shares owned in the Company. 

Our broad range of financial product and services are more consistent with those offered by larger financial institutions, while our high level of personalized service, accessibility and responsiveness to our clients are more typical of the services offered by boutique investment management firms and community banks. We believe this combination of an integrated platform of comprehensive financial services and products and personalized and responsive service differentiates us from many of our competitors and has contributed to the growth of our client base and our business. 

Overview of Our Banking Business 

FFB is engaged in private and commercial banking, offering a broad range of personal and business banking products and services and trust services to its clients. Its banking services include a variety of deposit products, including personal checking, savings and money market deposits and certificates of deposit, single family real estate loans, and consumer loans. FFB also provides 

&#160;

the convenience of online and other personal banking services to its clients. FFB&#8217;s business banking products and services include multifamily and commercial real estate loans, commercial term loans and lines of credit, transaction and other deposit accounts, online banking, mobile banking and enhanced business services. FFB has also established a lending platform that offers loans to individuals and entities who own and operate multifamily residential and commercial real estate properties. In addition, FFB provides its products and services to individuals and families who would not be considered high net-worth, small to moderate sized businesses and professional firms. FFIS was established to provide life, property and casualty agency insurance services as part of the platform of financial products and services. FFIS provides insurance risk management solutions to individuals, families and businesses. Clients are obtained through relationships/referrals from existing FFI clients and newly generated clients via prospecting. At December 31, 2015, FFB had $2.59 billion of total assets, $1.77 billion of loans and $1.52 billion of deposits. FFB&#8217;s operations comprise the trust and banking segment of our business. 

Overview of our Investment Advisory and Wealth Management Business 

FFA is a fee-based investment adviser which provides investment advisory services primarily to high net-worth individuals, their families and their family businesses, and other affiliated organizations. FFA strives to provide its clients with a high level of personalized service by its staff of experienced relationship managers. As of December 31, 2015, FFA had total $3.47 billion of AUM. FFA&#8217;s operations comprise the investment management, wealth planning and consulting segment of our business. 

Relationship Managers and Bankers 

Our operating strategy has been to build strong and stable long-term client relationships, one at a time, by delivering high quality, coordinated investment management, wealth planning, consulting, trust and banking products and services. The success of this strategy is largely attributable to our experienced and high quality client relationship managers and bankers. The primary role of our relationship managers and bankers, in addition to attracting new clients, is to develop and maintain a strong relationship with their clients and to coordinate the services we provide to their clients. We believe we can continue to attract and retain experienced and client-focused relationship managers and bankers. 

Banking Products and Services 

Through FFB, we offer a wide range of loan products, deposit products, business and personal banking services and trust services. Our loan products are designed to meet the credit needs of our clients in a manner that, at the same time, enables us to effectively manage the credit and interest rate risks inherent in our lending activities. Additional loan products offered to the broader markets we serve include commercial lending and commercial real estate lending, predominantly on multifamily properties. Deposits represent our principal source of funds for making loans and investments and acquiring other interest-earning assets. The yields we realize on our loans and other interest-earning assets and the interest rates we pay to attract and retain deposits are the principal determinants of our banking revenues. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Our lending activities serve the credit needs of high net-worth individuals and their businesses, owners of multifamily and commercial real estate properties, individuals and families who would not be considered high net-worth, small to moderate size businesses and professional firms in our market areas. As a result we offer a variety of loan products consisting of multifamily and single family residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial term loans and lines of credit, and consumer loans. We handle all loan processing, underwriting and servicing at our administrative office in Irvine, California.

Residential Mortgage Loans &#8211; Multi-family: We make multi-family residential mortgage loans for terms up to 30 years primarily for properties located in California. These loans generally are adjustable rate loans with interest rates tied to a variety of independent indexes; although in some cases these loans have fixed interest rates for periods ranging from 3 to 10 years and adjust thereafter based on an applicable index. These loans generally have interest rate floors, payment caps, and prepayment penalties. The loans are underwritten based on a variety of underwriting criteria, including an evaluation of the character and creditworthiness of the borrower and guarantors, loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios, borrower liquidity and credit history. In addition, we perform stress testing for changes in interest rates, capitalization rates and other factors and review general economic trends such as lease rates, values and absorption rates. We typically require personal guarantees from the owners of the entities to which we make such loans. 

Residential Mortgage Loans &#8211; Single-family: We offer single family residential mortgage loans primarily as an accommodation to our existing clients. In most cases, these take the form of non-conforming jumbo and super jumbo loans and FFB does not currently sell or securitize any of its single family residential mortgage loan originations. FFB does not originate loans defined as high cost by state or federal banking regulators. The majority of FFB&#8217;s single family residential loan originations are collateralized by first mortgages on real properties located in Southern California. These loans are generally adjustable rate loans with fixed terms ranging from 3 to 10 years and terms of the loan not exceeding 30 years. These loans generally have interest rate floors and payment caps. The loans are underwritten based on a variety of underwriting criteria, including an evaluation of the character and creditworthiness of the borrower and guarantors, loan-to-value and debt to income ratios, borrower liquidity, income verification and credit history. In addition, we perform stress testing for changes in interest rates and other factors and review general economic trends such as market values. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans -Owner Occupied: Owner occupied commercial real estate loans are generally made to businesses that have demonstrated a history of profitable operations. To qualify for such loans, prospective borrowers generally must have operating cash flow sufficient to meet their obligations as they become due, and good payment histories. Our commercial real estate loans are secured by first trust deeds on nonresidential real property. These loans generally are adjustable rate loans with interest rates tied to a variety of independent indexes; although in some cases these loans have fixed interest rates for periods ranging from 3 to 10 years and adjust thereafter based on an applicable index. These loans generally have terms of 10 years, interest rate floors, payment caps, and prepayment penalties. The loans are underwritten based on a variety of underwriting criteria, including an evaluation of the character and creditworthiness of the borrower and guarantors, loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios, borrower liquidity and credit history. In addition, we perform stress testing for changes in interest rates, cap rates and other factors and review general economic trends such as lease rates, values and absorption rates. We typically require personal guarantees from the owners of the entities to which we make such loans. 

Commercial Loans: We offer commercial term loans and commercial lines of credit to our clients. Commercial loans generally are made to businesses that have demonstrated a history of profitable operations. To qualify for such loans, prospective borrowers generally must have operating cash flow sufficient to meet their obligations as they become due, and good payment histories. Commercial term loans are either fixed rate loans or adjustable rate loans with interest rates tied to a variety of independent indexes and are made for terms ranging from 1 to 5 years. Commercial lines of credit are adjustable rate loans with interest rates usually tied to the Wall Street Journal prime rate or LIBOR rates, are made for terms ranging from 1 to 2 years, and contain various covenants, including a requirement that the borrower reduce its credit line borrowings to zero for specified time periods during the term of the line of credit. The loans are underwritten based on a variety of underwriting criteria, including an evaluation of the character and creditworthiness of the borrower and guarantors, debt service coverage ratios, historical and projected client income, 

&#160;

borrower liquidity and credit history. In addition, we perform stress testing for changes in interest rates and other factors and review general economic trends in the client&#8217;s industry. We typically require personal guarantees from the owners of the entities to which we make such loans. 

Equipment financing: Beginning in 2016, we are offering equipment financing to provide financing solutions to third party originators, including equipment brokers, lessors and other referral sources. We expect that a majority of the equipment financing business will be small in nature, typically averaging below $250,000, will have terms ranging from 3 to 7 years, will carry fixed rates and will be secured by the underlying equipment and the operations of the borrower. 

Small Business Lending and USDA Lending: The Bank is approved as a SBA lender and as a USDA lender. The Bank intends to expand its use of both the SBA and USDA lending programs as it identifies opportunities to serve existing clients and potential clients. As government guaranteed programs, the Bank will need to comply with underwriting guidelines and terms and conditions set forth under the related programs. 

Consumer Loans: We offer a variety of consumer loans and credit products, including personal installment loans and lines of credit, and home equity lines of credit designed to meet the needs of our clients. Consumer loans are either fixed rate loans or adjustable rate loans with interest rates tied to a variety of independent indexes and are made for terms ranging from 1 to 10 years. The loans are underwritten based on a variety of underwriting criteria, including an evaluation of the character creditworthiness and credit history of the borrower and guarantors, debt to income ratios, borrower liquidity, income verification, and the value of any collateral securing the loan. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower&#8217;s ongoing cash flows and financial stability and, as a result, generally pose higher credit risks than the other loans that we make. 

For all of our loan offerings, we utilize a comprehensive approach in our underwriting process. This includes the requirement that all factors considered in our underwriting be appropriately documented. In our underwriting, our primary focus is always on the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay. However, because our underwriting process allows us to view the totality of the borrower&#8217;s capacity to repay, concerns or issues in one area can be compensated for by other favorable financial criteria. This personalized and detailed approach allows us to better understand and meet our clients&#8217; lending needs. 

Bank Deposit Products: We offer a wide range of deposit products, including personal and business checking, savings accounts, interest-bearing negotiable order of withdrawal accounts, money market accounts and time certificates of deposit. The following table sets forth information regarding the type of deposits which our clients maintained with us and the average interest rates on those deposits as of December 31:

As of December 31, 2015, our 6 largest bank depositors accounted for, in the aggregate, 24% of our total deposits. See Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors . 

Trust Services: FFB is licensed to provides trust services to clients in California, Nevada and Hawaii. Those services, which consist primarily of the management of trust assets, complement the investment and wealth management services that FFA offers to our clients and, as a result, provide us with cross-selling opportunities. Additionally, trust service fees provide an additional source of noninterest income for us. At December 31, 2015, trust AUM totaled $1.03 billion. 

Insurance Services: Through FFIS, we offer life insurance products provided by unaffiliated insurance carriers from whom we collect a brokerage fee. 

Wealth Management Products and Services 

FFA is a fee-based investment advisor which provides investment advisory services and wealth management and consulting services primarily for high net-worth individuals and their families, family businesses and other affiliated organizations (including public and closely-held corporations, family foundations and private charitable organizations). FFA provides high net-worth clients 

&#160;

with personalized services designed to enable them to reach their personal and financial goals by coordinating FFA&#8217;s investment advisory and wealth management services with risk management and estate and tax planning services that are provided by outside service providers, for which FFA does not receive commissions or referral fees. FFA&#8217;s clients benefit from certain cost efficiencies available to institutional managers, such as block trading, access to institutionally priced no-load mutual funds, ability to seek competitive bid/ask pricing for bonds, low transaction costs and investment management fees charged as a percentage of the assets managed, with tiered pricing for larger accounts. 

FFA&#8217;s investment management team strives to create diversified investment portfolios for its clients that are individually designed, monitored and adjusted based on the discipline of fundamental investment analysis. FFA focuses on creating investment portfolios that are commensurate with a client&#8217;s objectives, risk preference and time horizon, using traditional investments such as individual stocks and bonds and mutual funds. FFA also provides comprehensive and ongoing advice and coordination regarding estate planning, retirement planning, charitable and business ownership issues, and issues faced by executives of publicly-traded companies. 

AUM at FFA has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 12% over the three year period ending December 31, 2015. Changes in our AUM reflects additions from new clients, the gains or losses recognized from investment results, additional funds received from existing clients, withdrawals of funds by clients, and terminations. During the 3 year period ending December 31, 2015, additions from new clients and net gains from investment results were 83% and 17%, respectively, of the total of additions from new clients and net gains from investment results. 

FFA does not provide custodial services for its clients. Instead, client investment accounts are maintained under custodial arrangements with large, well established brokerage firms, either directly or through FFB. However, FFA advises its clients that they are not obligated to use those services and that they are free to select securities brokerage firms and custodial service providers of their own choosing. FFA has entered into referral agreements with certain of the asset custodial firms that provide custodial services to our clients. Under these arrangements, the asset custodial firms provide referrals of prospective new clients whose increase in wealth warrants a more personalized and expansive breadth of financial services that we are able to provide in exchange for a fee. This fee is either a percentage of the fees we charge to the client or a percentage of the AUM of the client. The asset custodial firms are entitled to continue to receive these fees for as long as we continue to provide services to the referral client. These referral agreements do not require the client to maintain their assets at the custodial firm and are fully disclosed to the client prior to our providing services to them. 

FFA also provides wealth management services, consisting of financial, investment and economic advisory and related services, to high-net-worth individuals and their families, family businesses, and other affiliated organizations (including public and closely-held corporations, family foundations and private charitable organizations). Those services include education, instruction and consultation on financial planning and management matters, and Internet-based data processing administrative support services involving the processing and transmission of financial and economic data primarily for charitable organizations. 

Competition 

The banking and investment and wealth management businesses in California, Nevada and Hawaii, generally, and in our market areas, in particular, are highly competitive. A relatively small number of major national and regional banks, operating over wide geographic areas, including Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, US Bank, Comerica, Union Bank and Bank of America, dominate our banking markets. Those banks, or their affiliates, also offer banking and investment and wealth management services. We also compete with large, well known banking and wealth management firms, including City National, First Republic, Northern Trust and Boston Private. Those banks and investment and wealth management firms generally have much greater financial and capital resources than we do and as a result of their ability to conduct extensive advertising campaigns and their relatively long histories of operations in our markets, are generally better known than us. In addition, by virtue of their greater total capitalization, the large banks have substantially higher lending limits than we do, which enables them to make much larger loans and to offer loan products that we are not able to offer to our clients. 

We compete with these much larger banks and investment and wealth management firms primarily on the basis of the personal and &#8220;one-on-one&#8221; service that we provide to our clients, which many of these competitors are unwilling or unable to provide, other than to their wealthiest clients, due to costs involved or their &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; approaches to providing financial services to their clients. We believe that our principal competitive advantage is our ability to offer our banking, trust, insurance, investment and wealth management services through one integrated platform, enabling us to provide our clients with the efficiencies and benefits of dealing with a cohesive group of professional advisors and banking officers working together to assist our clients to meet their personal investment and financial goals. We believe that only the largest financial institutions in our area provide similar integrated platforms of products and services, which they sometimes reserve for their wealthiest and institutional clients. In addition, while we also compete with many local and regional banks and numerous local and regional investment advisory and wealth management firms, we believe that only a very few of these banks offer investment or wealth management services and that a very few of these investment 

&#160;

and wealth management firms offer banking services and, therefore, these competitors are not able to provide such an integrated platform of comprehensive financial services to their clients. This enables us to compete effectively for clients who are dissatisfied with the level of service provided at larger financial institutions, yet are not able to receive an integrated platform of comprehensive financial services from other regional or local financial services organizations. 

While we provide our clients with the convenience of technological access services, such as remote deposit capture, internet banking and mobile banking, we compete primarily by providing a high level of personal service. As a result, we do not try to compete exclusively on pricing. However, because we are located in a highly competitive market place and because we are seeking to grow our businesses, we attempt to maintain our pricing in line with our principal competitors. 

Supervision and Regulation

Both federal and state laws extensively regulate bank holding companies and banks. Such regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC&#8217;s deposit insurance fund and is not for the benefit of shareholders. Set forth below are summary descriptions of the material laws and regulations that affect or bear on our operations. Those summaries are not intended, and do not purport, to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the laws and regulations that are summarized below.

First Foundation Inc. is a registered bank holding company subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;Holding Company Act&#8221;). Pursuant to the Holding Company Act, we are subject to supervision and periodic examination by, and are required to file periodic reports with the FRB. 

As a bank holding company, we are allowed to engage, directly or indirectly, only in banking and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined, or in the future may deem, to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Business activities which the Federal Reserve has designated as being closely related to banking include the provision of investment advisory, securities brokerage, insurance agency and data processing services, among others. 

As a bank holding company, we also are required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB for the acquisition of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities, or of substantially all of the assets, by merger or purchase, of (i) any bank or other bank holding company and (ii) any other entities engaged in banking-related businesses or that provide banking-related services. 

Under FRB regulations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, it is the FRB&#8217;s policy that a bank holding company, in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks, should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. For that reason, among others, the Federal Reserve requires all bank holding companies to maintain capital at or above certain prescribed levels. A bank holding company&#8217;s failure to meet these requirements will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the FRB&#8217;s regulations or both, which could lead to the imposition of restrictions (including restrictions on growth) on, or a regulatory enforcement order against, the offending bank holding company. 

Additionally, among its powers, the Federal Reserve may require any bank holding company to terminate an activity or terminate control of, or liquidate or divest itself of, any subsidiary or affiliated company that the FRB determines constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of the bank holding company or any of its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to regulate provisions of a bank holding company&#8217;s debt, including authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt. Subject to certain exceptions, bank holding companies also are required to file written notice and obtain approval from the Federal Reserve prior to purchasing or redeeming their common stock or other equity securities. A bank holding company and its non-banking subsidiaries also are prohibited from implementing so-called tying arrangements whereby clients may be required to use or purchase services or products from the bank holding company or any of its non-bank subsidiaries in order to obtain a loan or other services from any of the holding company&#8217;s subsidiary banks. 

Financial Services Modernization Act

The Financial Services Modernization Act (the &#8220;Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act&#8221; or the &#8220;Modernization Act&#8221;), was enacted into law in 1999 primarily to establish a comprehensive framework that would permit affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies, securities and investment banking firms, and other financial service providers. Accordingly, the Modernization Act 

&#160;

amended the Holding Company Act to permit a bank holding company that meets certain eligibility requirements to qualify as a &#8220;financial holding company,&#8221; and its non-bank affiliated companies to engage in a broader range of financial activities to foster greater competition among financial services companies both domestically and internationally. 

The Modernization Act also contains provisions that expressly preempt and make unenforceable any state law restricting bank holding companies or their affiliates from engaging in the insurance underwriting or related businesses. That Act also: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

broadened the activities that may be conducted by national banks, bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies, and their financial subsidiaries; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

provided an enhanced framework for protecting the privacy of consumer information; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

adopted a number of provisions related to the capitalization, membership, corporate governance, and other measures designed to modernize the Federal Home Loan Bank system; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

modified the laws governing the implementation of the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;), which is described in greater detail below; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

addressed a variety of other legal and regulatory issues affecting both day-to-day operations and long-term activities of banking institutions. 

According to current FRB regulations implementing the Modernization Act, activities that are financial in nature and may be engaged in by financial holding companies, through their non-bank subsidiaries, include 

&#160;

&#9679;

securities underwriting, dealing and market making; 

&#160;

&#9679;

sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; 

&#160;

&#9679;

engaging in insurance underwriting; and 

&#160;

&#9679;

engaging in merchant banking activities. 

Before a bank holding company may engage in any of those financial activities, it must file an application with its Federal Reserve Bank that confirms that it meets certain qualitative eligibility requirements established by the FRB. A bank holding company that meets those qualifications and files such an application will be designated as a &#8220;financial holding company,&#8221; entitling it to affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities, primarily through non-banking subsidiaries, that are financial in nature or are incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. 

A bank holding company that does not qualify as, or chooses not to submit an application to become, a financial holding company may not engage in such financial activities. Instead, as discussed above, it will be limited to engaging in banking and such other activities that have been determined by the FRB to be closely related to banking. 

Acquisition of Control of a Bank Holding Company or a Bank

Subject to certain limited exemptions, the Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended (the &#8220;Change in Control Act&#8221;), together with their implementing regulations, require:

&#160;

&#183; 

the approval of the FRB before any person or company may acquire &#8220;control&#8221; of a bank holding company; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

the approval of an insured depository institution&#8217;s federal bank regulator before any person or company may acquire &#8220;control&#8221; of the institution. 

Under the Change in Control Act, control of a bank holding company or a bank or other insured depository institution is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company (i) acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company or the depository institution, or (ii) has the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the bank holding company or the insured depository institution, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; except that no individual will be deemed to control a bank holding company or an insured depository institution solely on account of being one of its directors, officers or employees. The Change in Control Act also establishes a presumption, which is rebuttable, that a person will be deemed to control a bank holding company or an insured depository institution if that person acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities of a bank holding company which has a class of equity securities registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act, or if no other person will own a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction. 

However, as a bank holding company, we must obtain the prior approval of the FRB to acquire more than five percent of the outstanding shares of voting securities of a bank or another bank holding company. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act, which is 

&#160;

discussed in greater detail below, provides that an acquisition by a bank holding company of a bank located outside the bank holding company&#8217;s home state may not be approved, unless the FRB has determined that the bank holding company is well-capitalized and well managed. 

Capital Requirements Applicable to Bank Holding Companies

Because it requires bank holding companies to be a source of financial strength for their bank subsidiaries, the Federal Reserve has adopted regulations that require bank holding companies to meet capital adequacy guidelines similar to those that apply to banks and other insured depository institutions. For additional information regarding these guidelines, see &#8220; First Foundation Bank &#8211; Capital Adequacy Guidelines &#8221; and First Foundation Bank &#8211; New Basel III Capital Requirements &#8221; below.

Dividends

It is the policy of FRB that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the holding company&#8217;s expected future needs for capital and liquidity and to maintain its financial condition. It is also an FRB policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of financial strength for their banking subsidiaries. Additionally, due to the current financial and economic environment, the FRB has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policies and has discouraged dividend payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. 

The Dodd-Frank Act 

From time to time, federal and state legislation is enacted which can affect our operations and our operating results by materially increasing our costs of doing business, limiting or expanding the activities in which banks and other financial institutions may engage, or altering the competitive balance between banks and non-bank financial service providers. 

The recent economic recession and credit crisis that required, among other measures, the federal government to provide substantial financial support to many of the largest of the banks and other financial service organizations in the United States, led the U.S. Congress to adopt a number of new laws, and the federal banking regulators, including the FRB and the FDIC, to take broad actions, to address systemic risks and volatility in the U.S. banking system. Set forth below is a summary of some of the provisions of the most significant of these laws, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). The regulatory sweep of the Dodd-Frank Act is broad and its provisions apply not only to the regulation of bank holding companies and insured depository institutions, but also to investment banking and other financial companies and to public companies that are regulated by the SEC. Accordingly, the following summary focuses primarily on the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that are applicable to banking organizations. It is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Dodd-Frank Act itself and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 

The Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed federal regulation of bank holding companies and banks and other insured depository institutions (collectively, &#8220;banking institutions&#8221;). Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act has created a new Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify systemic risks in the country&#8217;s banking and financial system and gives federal banking regulators new authority to take control of and liquidate banking institutions, and large investment banking and other financial services firms, facing the prospect of imminent failure in any case where such failure would create systemic risks to the U.S. banking or financial system. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;), which is a new independent federal regulatory agency with broad powers and authority to adopt regulations under, and administer and regulate, federal consumer protection laws. 

Imposition of New Capital Standards on Bank Holding Companies . The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve to apply consolidated capital requirements to bank holding companies that are no less stringent than those currently applied to insured depository institutions, such as FFB. The Federal Reserve implemented this requirement by its adoption of the new Basel III capital rules in June 2015. See &#8220; First Foundation Bank &#8212; New Basel III Capital Rules &#8221; below. 

Increase in Deposit Insurance and Changes Affecting the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund . The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum deposit insurance amount for banks, savings institutions and credit unions from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments which are used to fund the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) which, as a result, are now based on an insured depository institution&#8217;s average consolidated total assets, less tangible equity capital, may lead to increases in FDIC insurance assessments for many FDIC insured banks. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the FDIC to increase the reserve ratio of the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% of the total deposits insured by the FDIC by 2020 and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. See also, &#8220; First Foundation Bank &#8211; The Deposit Insurance Fund and FDIC Insurance Premiums &#8221; below. 

&#160;

Payment of Interest on Business Checking Accounts . The Dodd-Frank Act has eliminated a federal statutory prohibition against the payment of interest on business checking accounts, which is expected to increase the competition for and interest that banks are prepared to pay on such accounts. 

Limitations on Conversion of Bank Charters . The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits a bank or other depository institution from converting from a state to federal charter or vice versa while it is subject to a cease and desist order or other formal enforcement action or a memorandum of understanding with respect to a significant supervisory matter, unless the federal or state banking regulatory agency that issued the enforcement action does not object to the proposed conversion within 30 days following its receipt of a notice of that conversion. 

Interstate Banking . The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes national and state banks to establish branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish a branch in that state. Previously, banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in its state. Accordingly, banks will be able to enter new markets more freely. 

The Volcker Rule . Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted regulations, which became effective on April 1, 2014, to implement the &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221; which prohibits insured depository institutions and companies affiliated with insured depository institutions (&#8220;banking organizations&#8221;) from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, derivatives, commodity futures, and options on these instruments, for their own account. Those regulations also impose limits on the investments that banking organizations may make in, and other relationships that banking organizations may have with, hedge funds or private equity funds. Certain collateralized debt obligations, securities backed by trust preferred securities have been exempted from those prohibitions due to concerns that many community banks would otherwise have been required to recognize significant losses on such obligations and securities. 

These regulations provide exemptions for certain activities, including market making, underwriting, hedging, trading in government obligations, insurance company activities, and, under certain limited circumstances, organizing and offering hedge funds or private equity funds. The regulations also clarify that certain activities are not prohibited by the Volker Rule, including acting as agent, broker, or custodian. The compliance requirements under the regulations vary based on the size of the banking organization and the scope of its activities. Banking organizations with significant trading operations will be required to establish detailed compliance programs and their CEOs will be required to attest that the programs are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the final regulations. Independent testing and analyses of a banking organization&#8217;s compliance program also will be required. On the other hand, the regulations reduce the burden on smaller, less-complex banking organizations by limiting their compliance and reporting requirements. Additionally, a banking organization that does not engage in covered trading activities will not have to establish a compliance program. 

Neither the Company nor FFB held any investment positions at December 31, 2015 that were subject to these regulations. Therefore, these regulations have not required us to make any material changes in our operations or businesses.

Executive Compensation Restrictions

In June 2010, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC issued comprehensive guidelines on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of the organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidelines apply to any employees of a banking organization that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of a banking organization, either individually or as part of a group. 

Pursuant to these guidelines, each federal bank regulatory agency, as part of its regular, risk-focused examination of the banking organizations it regulates, assesses their incentive compensation arrangements based on the key principles their incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#8217;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance principles and practices, including active and effective oversight by the banking organization&#8217;s board of directors. The federal banking regulatory agencies have the authority to bring enforcement actions against a banking organization if the agency concludes that its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose an undue risk to the organization's safety and soundness and that the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act directs federal banking regulators to promulgate rules prohibiting incentive-based compensation arrangements that would encourage imprudent risk-taking by executives of depository institutions and their holding companies that have assets of more than $1.0 billion. Proposed rules were issued in 2011 but have not become final.

&#160;

Moreover, if an insured bank has been determined by its federal banking regulatory agency to be a &#8220;troubled&#8221; institution, it may not adopt any new, or make any payments or awards under any existing, incentive compensation plans, or make any change in control payments, to its executive officers without first obtaining the approval of its federal banking regulatory agency to do so. 

In February 2014, the Company adopted an incentive compensation clawback policy. Among other things, that policy provides that, if any of the Company&#8217;s previously published financial statements are restated due to a material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws, the Company will seek to recover the amount by which any incentive compensation paid in the previous three years to any executive officer exceeds the incentive compensation which the Company&#8217;s audit committee determines would have been paid to such executive officer had such compensation been determined on the basis of the restated financial statements. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#8221;) was enacted into law on July 30, 2002. The primary purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act were to strengthen (i) the oversight of public accounting firms that audit, and (ii) the corporate governance policies and practices of, companies the common stock or other equity securities of which are publicly traded. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act granted authority, primarily to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;), to adopt rules for implementing that Act. Among other things, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act: 

&#160;

&#183; 

provided for enhanced regulation of the independence, responsibilities and conduct of accounting firms which provide auditing services to public companies; 

&#160;

&#183; 

established an independent board, known as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the &#8220;PCAOB&#8221;), with the authority to set auditing, quality and ethical standards for, and the power to investigate and discipline, public accounting firms; 

&#160;

&#183; 

increased the criminal penalties for financial fraud committed by public company executives and public accounting firms or their key personnel; 

&#160;

&#183; 

required enhanced monitoring of, and certifications by, the chief executive and chief financial officers of public companies of their financial disclosures, internal financial controls and their audit processes; 

&#160;

&#183; 

required accelerated disclosures of material information by public companies; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

required enhanced disclosures by public companies of their corporate governance policies and practices. 

Additionally, pursuant to requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the New York, American and NASDAQ Stock Exchanges promulgated rules requiring public companies to adopt and implement expanded corporate governance policies and practices as a condition to the listing, or continued listing, of their shares on those exchanges. Among other things, those rules (i) require public companies to expand the authority, role and responsibilities of their boards of directors, (ii) require that a majority of the members of their boards of directors be independent of management and establish more stringent standards that directors needed to meet to qualify as independent directors, (iii) require boards of directors to establish standing audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees comprised of independent directors and (iv) increased the corporate transactions for which shareholder approval is required. 

Regulation of the Company by the California Department of Business Oversight

Because FFB is a California state chartered bank, the Company is deemed to be a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 1280 of the California Financial Code. As such, we are subject to examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the DBO. 

First Foundation Bank

General 

FFB is subject to primary supervision, periodic examination and regulation by (i) the FDIC, which is its primary federal banking regulator, and (ii) the DBO, because FFB is a California state chartered bank. 

&#160;

Various requirements and restrictions under Federal and California banking laws affect the operations of FFB. These laws and the implementing regulations, which are promulgated by federal and state bank regulatory agencies, can determine the extent of supervisory control to which a bank will be subject by its federal and state bank regulators. These laws and regulations cover most aspects of a bank&#8217;s operations, including: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

the reserves a bank must maintain against deposits and for possible loan losses and other contingencies; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

the types of and limits on loans and investments that a bank may make; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

the borrowings that a bank may incur; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

the opening of branch offices; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

the rate at which it may grow its assets and business; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

the acquisition and merger activities of a bank; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

the amount of dividends that a bank may pay; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

the capital requirements that a bank must satisfy. 

If, as a result of an examination of a federally regulated bank, its federal banking regulatory agency, such as the FDIC, were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of the bank&#8217;s operations had become unsatisfactory or that the bank or its management was in violation of any law or regulation, that agency would have the authority to take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate under the circumstances. These actions include the power: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

to enjoin any &#8220;unsafe or unsound&#8221; banking practices; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

to require that affirmative action be taken to correct any conditions resulting from any violation of law or unsafe or unsound practice; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced against the bank; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

to require the bank to increase its capital; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

to restrict the bank&#8217;s growth; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

to assess civil monetary penalties against the bank or its officers or directors; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

to remove officers and directors of the bank; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

if the federal agency concludes that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate a bank&#8217;s deposit insurance, which in the case of a California state chartered bank would result in revocation of its charter and require it to cease its banking operations. 

Additionally, under California law the DBO has many of these same remedial powers with respect to FFB. 

Permissible Activities and Subsidiaries 

California law permits state chartered commercial banks to engage in any activity permissible for national banks. Those permissible activities include conducting many so-called &#8220;closely related to banking&#8221; or &#8220;nonbanking&#8221; activities either directly or through their operating subsidiaries. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System

FFB is a member of the FHLB. Among other benefits, each regional Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region and makes available loans or advances to its member banks. Each regional Federal Home Loan Bank is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the overall Federal Home Loan Bank system. As an FHLB member, FFB is required to own a certain amount of capital stock in the FHLB. At December 31, 2015, FFB was in compliance with the FHLB&#8217;s stock ownership requirement. Historically, the FHLB has paid dividends on its capital stock to its members. 

Federal Reserve Board Deposit Reserve Requirements

The FRB requires all federally-insured depository institutions to maintain reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts. At December 31, 2015, FFB was in compliance with these requirements. 

&#160;

Limitations and Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds by FFB &#160; 

Cash dividends from FFB are one of the principal sources of cash (in addition to any cash dividends that might be paid to us by FFA) that is available to the Company for its operations and to fund any cash dividends that our board of directors might declare in the future. We are a legal entity separate and distinct from FFB and FFB is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay cash dividends to us. Those restrictions would prohibit FFB, subject to certain limited exceptions, from paying cash dividends in amounts that would cause FFB to become undercapitalized. Additionally, the FDIC and the DBO have the authority to prohibit FFB from paying cash dividends, if either of those agencies deems the payment of dividends by FFB to be an unsafe or unsound practice. 

The FDIC also has established guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by banks under its jurisdiction. Compliance with the standards set forth in those guidelines and the restrictions that are or may be imposed under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law could limit the amount of dividends which FFB may pay. 

Restrictions on Transactions between FFB and the Company and its other Affiliates

FFB is subject to Sections 23A and 23B of, and FRB Regulation W under, the Federal Reserve Act, which impose restrictions on (i) any extensions of credit to, or the issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit on behalf of, the Company or any of its other subsidiaries; (ii) the purchase of or investments in Company stock or other Company securities; (iii) the taking of Company securities as collateral for the loans that FFB makes; (iv) the purchase of assets from the Company or any of its other subsidiaries and (v) transactions between a bank and its financial subsidiaries, as well as other affiliates. Thus, under the final rule, transactions between a bank and its financial subsidiary, as well as other affiliates, are subject to the requirements of sections 23A and 23B. These restrictions prevent the Company and any of its subsidiaries from obtaining borrowings or extensions of credit from FFB, unless the borrowings are secured by marketable obligations in designated amounts, and such secured loans and any investments by FFB in the Company or any of its subsidiaries are limited, individually, to 10% of FFB&#8217;s capital and surplus (as defined by federal regulations), and in the aggregate are limited to 20%, of FFB&#8217;s capital and surplus. California law also imposes restrictions with respect to transactions involving the Company and any other persons that may be deemed under that law to control FFB. 

The Dodd-Frank Act extended the application of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act to derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions that create credit exposure to an affiliate or an insider of a bank. Any such transactions with any affiliates must be fully secured. In addition, the exemption from Section 23A for transactions with financial subsidiaries has been eliminated. The Dodd-Frank Act also expands the definition of &#8220;affiliate&#8221; for purposes of quantitative and qualitative limitations of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act to include mutual funds advised by a depository institution or any of its affiliates. 

Safety and Soundness Standards

Banking institutions may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal banking regulators for unsafe or unsound practices or for violating any law, rule, regulation, or any condition imposed in writing by its primary federal banking regulatory agency or any written agreement with that agency. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines designed to identify and address potential safety and soundness concerns that could, if not corrected, lead to deterioration in the quality of a bank&#8217;s assets, liquidity or capital. Those guidelines set forth operational and managerial standards relating to such matters as: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

risk management; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

loan documentation; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

credit underwriting; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

asset growth; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

earnings; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

compensation, fees and benefits. 

In addition, the federal banking agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines with respect to the quality of loans and other assets of insured depository institutions. These guidelines provide standards for establishing and maintaining a system to identify problem loans and other problem assets and to prevent those assets from deteriorating. Under these standards, an FDIC-insured depository institution is expected to: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

conduct periodic asset quality reviews to identify problem loans and any other problem assets, estimate the inherent losses in those loans and other assets and establish reserves that are sufficient to absorb those estimated losses; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

compare problem loans and other problem asset totals to capital; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

take appropriate corrective action to resolve problem loans and other problem assets; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

consider the size and potential risks of material asset concentrations; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

provide periodic quality reports with respect to their loans and other assets which provide adequate information for the bank&#8217;s management and the board of directors to assess the level of risk to its loans and other assets. 

These guidelines also establish standards for evaluating and monitoring earnings and for ensuring that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves. 

Regulatory Guidelines for Commercial Real Estate Loan Concentrations

The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have published guidelines that call for the adoption of heightened risk mitigation measures by insured banks with a concentration of commercial real estate loans in its loan portfolio. The guidelines provide that a bank will be deemed to have a concentration of commercial real estate loans if (i) the total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of the bank's total capital, or (ii) the total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm residential properties, plus loans for construction, land development and other land, represent 300% or more of the bank&#8217;s total capital and the bank&#8217;s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 months. If such a concentration exists, the guidelines call for the bank (x) to implement heightened risk assessment and risk management practices, including board and management oversight and strategic planning, (y) to implement and maintain stringent loan underwriting standards, and to use market analyses and stress testing tools to monitor the condition of the bank&#8217;s commercial real estate loan portfolio and to assess the impact that adverse economic conditions affecting the real estate markets could have on the bank&#8217;s financial condition and (z) if determined to be necessary on the basis of the results of such stress tests, to increase its allowance for loan losses and its capital. 

Single Borrower Loan Limitations

California law imposes on all California state-chartered banks, including FFB, &#8220;single borrower loan limitations&#8221; which consist of the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

unsecured borrowings of any customer of a California state-chartered bank, together with the borrowings of any family members or affiliates of the customer, to the bank may not exceed 15% of the sum of the bank&#8217;s shareholders&#8217; equity, allowance for loan losses, capital notes and debentures; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

the aggregate of secured and unsecured borrowings of any customer of a California state-chartered bank, together with the borrowings of any family members or affiliates of the customer, to the bank may not exceed 25% of the sum of the bank&#8217;s shareholders&#8217; equity, allowance for loan losses, capital notes and debentures. 

Technology Risk Management and Consumer Privacy

Federal and state banking regulatory agencies have issued various policy statements focusing on the importance of technology risk management and supervision in evaluating the safety and soundness of the banks they regulate. According to those policy statements, the use by banking organizations of technology-related products, services, processes and delivery channels, such as the internet, exposes them to a number of risks which include operational, compliance, security, privacy, and reputational risk. The banking regulators generally expect the banking organizations they regulate to prudently manage technology-related risks as part of their comprehensive risk management policies in order to identify, monitor, measure and control risks associated with the use of technology. 

Pursuant to the Modernization Act, the federal banking agencies have adopted rules and established standards to be followed in implementing safeguards that are designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protection against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protection against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information in a way that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to a customer. Among other requirements, these rules require each bank organization to implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards relating to customer information. 

In addition, the Modernization Act requires banking organizations to provide each of their customers with a notice of their privacy policies and practices and prohibits a banking organization from disclosing nonpublic personal information about a customer to nonaffiliated third parties unless the banking organization satisfies various notice and &#8220;opt-out&#8221; requirements and the customer has not chosen to opt out of the disclosure. Additionally, the federal banking agencies are authorized to issue regulations as necessary to implement those notice requirements and non-disclosure restrictions. More specifically, the Modernization Act privacy regulations 

&#160;

require all banking organizations to develop initial and annual privacy notices that describe in general terms the banking organization&#8217;s information sharing practices. Any banking organization that shares nonpublic personal information about customers with nonaffiliated third parties must also provide customers with notices advising them that, subject to certain limited exceptions, the customer has the opportunity and a reasonable time period to inform the bank that it may not share the customer&#8217;s nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliates of the bank. These regulations also place limitations on the extent to which a banking organization may disclose an account number or access code for credit card, deposit, or transaction accounts to any nonaffiliated third party for use in marketing such programs. 

Capital Adequacy and Prompt Corrective Action Provisions of the FDIC Improvement Act

Capital Adequacy Guidelines . The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the &#8220;FDICIA&#8221;), established a framework for regulation of federally insured depository institutions, including banks, and their parent holding companies and other affiliates, by their federal banking regulators. Among other things, FDICIA requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards, including requiring the prompt submission by that bank of an acceptable capital restoration plan if its bank regulator has concluded that it needs additional capital. 

Supervisory actions by a bank&#8217;s federal regulator under the prompt corrective action rules generally depend upon an institution&#8217;s classification within one of five capital categories, which is determined on the basis of a bank&#8217;s Tier 1 leverage ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio and total capital ratio. Tier 1 capital consists principally of common stock and nonredeemable preferred stock and retained earnings. 

Under FDICIA regulations, an insured depository institution&#8217;s capital category will depend upon how its capital levels compare with these capital measures and the other factors established by the relevant federal banking regulator. Prior to January 1, 2015, those regulations provided that a bank would be classified as: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

&#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it had a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and was not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory agency to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

&#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it had a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.0% or greater, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater, but was not &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

&#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it had a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.0%; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

&#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it had a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3.0%, or a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

&#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if its tangible equity was equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets. 

Effective January 1, 2016, to be &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under FDICIA, a bank must also have a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5% and a Tier 1 ratio of 8.0% or greater. 

However, if a bank that was classified as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; is determined (after notice and opportunity for hearing), by its federal banking regulator, to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice, that agency could, under certain circumstances, reclassify the bank as adequately capitalized. The federal banking regulator of a bank that is classified as adequately capitalized or undercapitalized could require the bank to comply with bank supervisory provisions and restrictions that would apply to a bank in the next lower capital classification, if the banking regulator has obtained supervisory information regarding the bank (other than with respect to its capital levels) which raises safety or soundness concerns. However, a significantly undercapitalized bank may not be treated by its regulatory agency as critically undercapitalized by reason of such safety or soundness concerns alone. 

The capital classification of a bank affects the frequency of examinations of the bank by its primary federal bank regulatory agency, impacts the ability of the bank to engage in certain activities and affects the deposit insurance premiums that are payable by the bank. Under FDICIA, the federal banking regulators are required to conduct a full-scope, on-site examination of every bank at least once every 12 months. 

Corrective Measures for Undercapitalized Banks . FDICIA generally prohibits a bank from paying any dividends or making any capital distributions or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the bank would thereafter be &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; In addition &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; banks are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital 

&#160;

restoration plan for approval by its federal regulatory agency. However, that agency may not approve the bank&#8217;s capital restoration plan unless the agency determines, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the bank&#8217;s capital. 

An undercapitalized bank which fails to submit, or fails to obtain the approval by its federal banking regulator of a capital restoration plan will be treated as if it is &#8220;significantly undercapitalized.&#8221; In that event, the bank&#8217;s federal banking regulator may impose a number of additional requirements and restrictions on the bank, including orders or requirements (i) to sell sufficient voting stock to become &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; (ii) to reduce its total assets, and (iii) cease the receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. &#8220;Critically undercapitalized&#8221; institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. 

If an undercapitalized bank is a subsidiary of a bank holding company, then, for its capital restoration plan to be approved, the bank&#8217;s parent holding company must guarantee that the bank will comply with, and provide assurances of the performance by the bank of, its capital restoration plan. Under such a guarantee and assurance of performance, if the bank fails to comply with its capital restoration plan, the parent holding company may become subject to liability for such failure in an amount up to the lesser of (i) 5.0% of its bank subsidiary&#8217;s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized, or (ii) the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the bank into compliance with all applicable capital standards as of the time it failed to comply with the plan.

Corrective Measures for Significantly and Critically Undercapitalized Banks . If a bank is classified as &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized,&#8221; its federal banking regulator would be required to take one or more prompt corrective actions that would, among other things require the bank to (i) raise additional capital by means of sales of common stock or nonredeemable preferred shares, (ii) improve its management, (iii) limit the interest rates it may pay on deposits, (iv) altogether prohibit transactions by the bank with its affiliates, (v) terminate certain activities that pose undue or unreasonable risks, and (vi) restrict the compensation being paid to its executive officers. If a bank is classified as critically undercapitalized, FDICIA requires the bank to be placed into conservatorship or receivership within 90 days, unless its federal banking regulatory agency determines that there are other measures that would enable the bank, within a relatively short period of time, to increase its capital in an amount sufficient to improve its capital classification under the prompt corrective action framework. 

New Basel III Capital Rules

Prior to 2015, the risk-based capital rules applicable to domestic banks and bank holding companies were based on the 1988 capital accord of the International Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;), which is comprised of central banks and bank supervisors and regulators from the major industrialized countries. The Basel Committee develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country&#8217;s banking regulators in determining the banking supervisory policies and rules they apply. In December 2010, the Basel Committee issued a new set of international guidelines for determining regulatory capital, known as &#8220;Basel III&#8221;. In June 2012, the FRB issued, for public comment, three notices of proposed rulemaking which, if adopted, would have made significant changes, consistent with the Basel III guidelines, to the regulatory risk-based capital and leverage requirements for banks and bank holding companies in the United States.

In July 2012, the FRB adopted final rules (the &#8220;New Capital Rules&#8221;) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations, and the FDIC subsequently adopted substantially identical rules. The rules implement the Basel Committee&#8217;s December 2010 framework for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The New Capital Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to U.S. banking organizations, including the Company and FFB, from the prior U.S. risk-based capital rules, redefined the components of capital and addressed other issues affecting the capital ratios applicable to banking organizations. The New Capital Rules also replaced the existing approach used in risk-weighting of a banking organization&#8217;s assets with a more risk-sensitive approach. The New Capital Rules became effective for the Company and FFB on January 1, 2015 (subject, in the case of certain of those Rules, to phase-in periods). 

Among other things, the New Capital Rules (i) introduced a new capital measure called &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET-1&#8221;), (ii) specified that Tier 1 capital consists of CET-1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) made most deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital measures applicable to CET-,1 and not to the other components of capital, and expanded the scope of the deductions and adjustments from capital as compared to the prior capital rules, thus potentially requiring banking organizations to achieve and maintain higher levels of CET-1 in order to meet minimum capital ratios. 

&#160;

Under the New Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios (including the applicable increment of the capital conservation buffer discussed below) as of January 1, 2016 are as follows: 

CET-1 to risk-weighted assets

&#160;

5.125

%

Tier 1 capital (i.e., CET-1 plus Additional Tier 1) to risk-weighted assets

&#160;

6.625

%

Total capital (i.e., Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets

&#160;

8.625

%

Tier 1 capital-to-average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (1) 

&#160;

4.0

%

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

(1) 

Commonly referred to as a banking institution&#8217;s &#8220;leverage ratio&#8221;. 

When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the New Capital Rules also will require the Company and FFB, as well as most other bank holding companies and banks, to maintain a 2.5% &#8220;capital conservation buffer,&#8221; on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios set forth in the above table. This capital conservation buffer will have the effect of increasing (i) the CET-1-to-risk-weighted asset ratio to 7.0%, (ii) the Tier 1 capital-to-risk-weighted asset ratio to 8.5%, and (iii) the Total capital-to-risk weighted asset ratio to 10.5%. 

The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking organizations with risk-weighted asset ratios above the minimum, but below the capital conservation buffer, will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and executive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on January 1, 2016 at 0.625%, and will increase by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 

The New Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET-1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income, and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities, be deducted from CET-1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET-1 or all such categories, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET-1. Other deductions and adjustments to CET-1 will be phased in incrementally between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2018. On the other hand, the impact of these deductions and adjustments may be mitigated prior to or during the phase-in period by the determination of other than temporary impairments (&#8220;OTTI&#8221;) and additional accumulation of retained earnings. Under current capital standards, the effects of certain items of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) included in capital are excluded for purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. By contrast, under the New Capital Rules, the effects of certain items of AOCI will not be excluded. However, most banking organizations, including the Company and FFB, were entitled to make a one-time permanent election, not later than the call report for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, to continue to exclude these items from capital. In 2015, we elected to continue this exclusion. 

The New Capital Rules require that trust preferred securities be phased out from Tier 1 capital by January 1, 2016, except in the case of banking organizations with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion, which will be permitted to include trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital, subject to a limit of 25% of tier 1 capital elements. 

The New Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets that expand the risk-weighting categories from the former four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to larger and a greater number of risk-sensitive categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. Government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. In addition, the New Capital Rules also provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation. 

The Deposit Insurance Fund and FDIC Deposit Insurance Premiums 

The FDIC insures the deposits of the customers of all FDIC insured depository institutions up to prescribed limits for each depositor through a Deposit Insurance Fund (the &#8220;DIF&#8221;), from which it makes deposit insurance payments to depositors of failed depository institutions and from which it funds the costs incurred and against which it charges the losses sustained in connection with the closure or other resolution of those institutions. Due to higher levels of bank failures resulting from the recent recession and credit crisis, the insurance payments and the resolution costs increased significantly and largely depleted the DIF. In order to restore the DIF to a statutorily mandated minimum of 1.35% of total deposits which it insures (as compared to 1.15% prior to Dodd-Frank), the FDIC has increased deposit insurance premium rates. The FDIC uses a risk-based system to determine a depository institution&#8217;s insurance premium rate based on the institution&#8217;s classification. Institutions assigned to higher risk classifications (that is, institutions that pose a higher risk of loss to the DIF) pay premiums at higher rates than institutions that pose a lower risk. A depository institution&#8217;s risk classification is assigned based primarily on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern which the institution poses to the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority, under certain circumstances, to further increase the insurance premium rates of depository 

&#160;

institutions. Any increase in FDIC insurance premiums assessed on FFB in the future would increase our noninterest expense and thereby reduce our profitability. 

Additionally, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;), an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the DIF. The FICO assessment rates, which are determined quarterly, averaged 0.066% of insured deposits in fiscal 2015. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017. 

Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Developments

Like all other federally regulated banks, FFB is subject to fair lending requirements and the evaluation of its small business operations under the CRA. The CRA generally requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to evaluate the record of a bank in meeting the credit needs of its local communities, including those of low and moderate income neighborhoods in its service area. A bank&#8217;s compliance with its CRA obligations is based on a performance-based evaluation system which determines the bank&#8217;s CRA ratings on the basis of its community lending and community development performance. A bank may have substantial penalties imposed on it and generally will be required to take corrective measures in the event it fails to meet its obligations under the CRA. Federal banking agencies also may take compliance with the CRA and other fair lending laws into account when regulating and supervising other activities of a bank or its bank holding company. Moreover, when a bank holding company files an application for approval to acquire a bank or another bank holding company, the federal banking regulatory agency to which the application is assigned will review the CRA assessment of the subsidiary bank or banks of the applicant bank holding company, and a low CRA rating may be the basis for requiring the applicant&#8217;s bank subsidiary to take corrective actions to improve its CRA performance as a condition to the approval of the acquisition or as a basis for denying the application altogether. 

USA Patriot Act of 2001 and Bank Secrecy Act

In October 2001, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism of 2001 (the &#8220;USA Patriot Act&#8221;) was enacted into law in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The USA Patriot Act was adopted to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. Of particular relevance to banks and other federally insured depository institutions are the USA Patriot Act&#8217;s sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions and various related implementing regulations that: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

establish due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer, maintain, or manage private bank accounts and foreign correspondent accounts; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

prohibit U.S. institutions from providing correspondent accounts to foreign shell banks; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

establish standards for verifying client identification at account opening; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

set rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulatory agencies and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. 

Under implementing regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, banking institutions are required to incorporate a client identification program into their written money laundering plans that includes procedures for: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

verifying the identity of any person seeking to open an account, to the extent reasonable and practicable; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

maintaining records of the information used to verify the person&#8217;s identity; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

determining whether the person appears on any list of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations. 

The Company and FFB also are subject to the federal Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended (the &#8220;Bank Secrecy Act&#8221;), which establishes requirements for recordkeeping and reporting by banks and other financial institutions designed to help identify the source, volume and movement of currency and monetary instruments into and out of the United States to help detect and prevent money laundering and other illegal activities. The Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to develop and maintain a program reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with its requirements, to train employees to comply with and to test the effectiveness of the program. Any failure to meet the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act can result in the imposition of substantial penalties and in adverse regulatory action against the offending bank. FFI and FFB have each adopted policies and procedures to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act. 

Consumer Laws and Regulations

&#160;

The Company and FFB are subject to a broad range of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition. Those laws and regulations include: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994, which requires additional disclosures and consumer protections to borrowers designed to protect them against certain lending practices, such as practices deemed to constitute &#8220;predatory lending.&#8221; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

The Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which requires banking institutions and financial services businesses to adopt practices and procedures designed to help deter identity theft, including developing appropriate fraud response programs, and provides consumers with greater control of their credit data. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

The Truth in Lending Act which requires that credit terms be disclosed in a meaningful and consistent way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which generally prohibits, in connection with any consumer or business credit transactions, discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), or the fact that a borrower is receiving income from public assistance programs. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

The Fair Housing Act, which regulates many lending practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which includes a &#8220;fair lending&#8221; aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements and prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

The National Flood Insurance Act, which requires homes in flood-prone areas with mortgages from a federally regulated lender to have flood insurance. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

The Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, which requires mortgage loan originator employees of federally insured institutions to register with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry, a database created by the states to support the licensing of mortgage loan originators, prior to originating residential mortgage loans. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

The Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency, called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has been granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to the compliance by depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets with federal consumer protection laws and regulations. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB, but continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act also (i) authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay, and (ii) will allow borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; as defined by the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal financial consumer protection laws and regulations. 

In January 2013, the CFPB approved certain mortgage lending reform regulations impacting the Truth in Lending Act (the &#8220;TILA&#8221;) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (&#8220;RESPA&#8221;). Among other things, those reforms: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

expand the population of loans that are subject to higher cost loan regulations and additional disclosures; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

prohibit the payment of compensation to mortgage brokers based on certain fees or premiums, such as yield spread premiums, payable by or charged to home borrowers; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

increase the regulation of mortgage servicing activities, including with respect to error resolution, forced-placement insurance and loss mitigation and collection activities; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

require financial institutions to make a reasonable and good faith determination that the borrower has the ability to repay the residential mortgage loan before it is approved for funding and provides that the failure of a financial institution to make such a determination will entitle the borrower to assert that failure as a defense to any foreclosure action on the mortgage loan; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

impose appraisal requirements for high cost loans and loans secured by first mortgage liens on residential real estate. 

The CFPB also issued final rules for residential mortgage lending, which became effective January 10, 2014, including definitions for &#8220;qualified mortgages&#8221; and detailed standards by which leaders must satisfy themselves of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan and revised forms of disclosure under the TILA and RESPA. New CFPB disclosure rules for residential mortgages went into effect in October 2015.

Debit Card Fees

The Dodd-Frank Act provides that the amount of any interchange fee charged by a debit card issuer with respect to a debit card transaction must be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the card issuer and requires the FRB to establish standards for reasonable and proportional fees which may take into account the costs of preventing fraud. As a result, the FRB adopted a rule, effective October 1, 2011, which limits interchange fees on debit card transactions to a maximum of 21 cents per transaction plus 5 basis points of the transaction amount. A debit card issuer may recover an additional one cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements prescribed by the FRB. Although, as a technical matter, this new limitation applies only to institutions with assets of more than $10 billion, it is expected that many smaller institutions will reduce their interchange fees in order to remain competitive with the larger institutions that are required to comply with this new limitation. 

First Foundation Advisors

Registered Investment Adviser Regulation 

FFA is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act and the SEC&#8217;s regulations promulgated thereunder. The Investment Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary, recordkeeping, operational, and disclosure obligations. FFA is also subject to regulation under the securities laws and fiduciary laws of certain states and to Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;), and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as it is a &#8220;fiduciary&#8221; under ERISA with respect to certain of its clients. ERISA and the applicable provisions of the Code, impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, and prohibit certain transactions by the fiduciaries (and certain other related parties) to such plans. The foregoing laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict FFA from conducting its business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed in the event of such noncompliance include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on the business activities for specified periods of time, revocation of registration as an investment adviser and/or other registrations, and other censures and fines. Changes in these laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on the profitability and mode of operations of FFI and its subsidiaries. 

Future Legislation

Congress may enact legislation from time to time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations, or the application thereof, cannot be predicted, although enactment of the proposed legislation could impact the regulatory structure under which we operate and may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital, modify our business strategy and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. 

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately 295 full-time employees.
