Organizational History 

&#160;

LifeApps Brands Inc., through our wholly owned subsidiary LifeApps, Inc., is a digital media company focusing on health, fitness and sports digital publications, entertainment, fitness products. We plan to leverage a suite of cross-platform, multi-device publications and applications in the rapidly growing health, fitness and sports digital marketplace to generate paid subscriptions, advertising, e-commerce/mobile-commerce and consumer product sales revenues. The company intends to focus on creating brands, acquisitions of other brands as well as licensing brands. Part of any branding will rely heavily upon promotion, marketing and advertising. The many benefits of having a brand is recognition and loyalty from customers, familiarity as well as the ability to link additional products and services under a specific brand.

&#160;

We were incorporated in the state of Delaware as Prime Time Travel, Inc. on November 23, 2010, for the purpose of creating and managing trips to destination locations for youth basketball teams. On August 23, 2012, we filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State to, among other things, change our name from Prime Time Travel, Inc. to LifeApps Digital Media Inc., and increase our authorized capitalization to 310,000,000 shares, consisting of 300,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and 10,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share.

&#160;

On September 5, 2012, we effected a 15-for-1 forward stock split in the form of a dividend to holders of our common stock as of record on September 4, 2012.

&#160;

On September 20, 2012, LifeApps Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned Nevada subsidiary of ours, merged with and into LifeApps Inc., which had been organized as a California limited liability company on July 13, 2009, and was converted to a Nevada corporation on September 7, 2012 in anticipation of the merger. In connection with the merger, each share of LifeApps common stock was cancelled and converted into the right to receive 400 shares of our common stock. LifeApps was the surviving corporation of that Merger. As a result of the Merger, we acquired the business of LifeApps, and are continuing the existing business operations of LifeApps as our primary business operations.

&#160;

Immediately following the merger, we split off our wholly owned subsidiary, Prime Time Split Corp., a Delaware corporation, through the exchange of 6,000,000 shares of our common stock for all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Split Corp. All of our assets and liabilities immediately following the merger, excluding any assets and liabilities assumed in the merger, were transferred to Split Corp.

&#160;

On December 31, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State to (i) change our corporate name to LifeApps Brands Inc., (ii) effect a one-for-fifteen (1:15) reverse stock split (the &#8220;Reverse Split&#8221;) of our common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and (iii) increase our authorized capitalization from 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, to 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. The Reverse Split and Name Change took effect on OTC Markets at the commencement of business on January 7, 2016, at which time our common stock began trading on a post-reverse split basis.

Business Overview 

&#160;

LifeApps Brands Inc. is an emerging growth company and developer and designer of applications, medical and fitness products, new media, digital magazines, publications, and next-generation social networks for sports, health, fitness and entertainment enthusiasts. We have a multimarket revenue strategy that incorporates mobile apps, digital magazines, publications, fitness training devices, web, social media and internet TV to engage consumers in multiple areas of sports, health, fitness and entertainment interests including medical, yoga, golf, tennis, running, soccer, cycling, and other health, fitness and sports topics.

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

LifeApps&#174; is a licensed developer and publisher of apps for the Apple App Store for iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and iPad mini. LifeApps&#174; is also a licensed developer on both Google Play and Amazon Appstore for Android. LifeApps&#174; has distributed apps/publications on all three platforms. Moving forward LifeApps is developing new apps, and exploring new opportunities pairing apps with physical retail and e-commerce/mobile-commerce products.

&#160;

LifeApps&#174; is aggressively pushing forward on a strategy for utilizing mobile applications related to healthcare with the LifeApps Health initiative. LifeApps Health, building on the success of the LifeApps MDWorkout&#174; mobile app platform, will bring together consumer mHealth lifestyle products, like-minded medical health organizations and medically based health and fitness research organizations to create apps. The convergence of consumer apps with medical programs and clinical research is an exciting milestone in the mHealth marketplace. LifeApps&#174; believes that its unique position as an established market particpant in providing medically based mHealth fitness lifestyle apps will make LifeApps Health the desired partner for medical organizations who are looking for guidance, app development and distribution into the mHealth marketplace. We believe that we will drive revenues by targeting sports, health and fitness specific communities and developing a relationship with their participants, delivering lifestyle content, social networking, skills and drills training, consumer fitness devices and nutritional content across multiple platforms including, but not limited to, Apple iOS and Google Android systems. LifeApps&#174; plans to invest in these sports, health and fitness communities through partnerships with trusted medical organizations, increasing brand awareness and delivering digital content of interest and digitally enhanced physical consumer products that enrich and improve the user&#8217;s sports, health and fitness lifestyle.

&#160;

The LifeApps Health initiative has already seen results with LifeApps MDWorkout&#174; entering into the IMS Health AppScript&#8482; program. AppScript&#8482; is a first-of-its-kind prescription service that allows medical health professionals the ability to prescribe mHealth apps to their patients. IMS Health rigorously reviews and tests apps before accepting them into their program.

&#160;

As individuals continue to migrate to mobile devices for their information and entertainment from traditional media and consumption sources such as the personal computers and print publications, the opportunity to reach more consumers with a wider range of digitally enhanced multi-media tools is possible. Unlike traditional print and disc based (DVD) media which have a limited shelf life, we will be able to continually augment our products to include more entertainment based content and information through enhanced media such as videos, audio, podcasts, push alerts, in-app messaging and app updates, which extend the life of our products beyond the first sale. Internet connected mobile devices and mobile applications provide real time communication with customers, and strengthen our ability to deliver timely and relevant content and messages to them.

&#160;

As mobile devices have become more feature rich, people are engaging their phones more frequently for tasks beyond placing phone calls, including, for example, app usage, social media, text messaging and photography. According to Cisco, by 2017, there will be nearly 1.4 mobile devices per capita.

&#160;

The Mobile space as a whole continues to evolve. According to Gartner&#8217;s Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2014, mobile devices surpassed PCs as the most common access tools for the internet in 2013.

&#160;

2014 also saw the emergence of the smart wearables market. The wearable band market grew 684% in the first half of 2014 on a worldwide basis compared to 2013 according to Canalys. These wearables included products such as the FitBit, Jawbone UP and the NIKE Fuelband. Additionally the smart-watch began to take the lead in the wearables market with Google&#8217;s Android Wear operating system appearing in products from Samsung and others.

&#160;

In 2015 Pew Research Center issued a report of US Smartphone use. One of the many statistics reported were more than half of Smartphone owners have used their phone to get health information, and do online banking. It was also reported that 44% have used their Smartphone to look up real estate listings and 43% to look up information about a job. On November 22, 2015 Apple reported that it has shipped its 1 billionth iOS device.

&#160;

According to Statista (Statistics Portal) global app downloads are projected to reach 268 billion in 2017. In 2009, worldwide app downloads were approximately 2.52 billion.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

LifeApps&#174; is also expanding its revenue generating potential through the creation of new gateway digital platforms that combine e-commerce with mobile-commerce solutions for sports, health and fitness communities, to act as conduits or meeting places for users to engage in the commerce of sports, health and fitness products and services. These gateway platforms can also be utilized and distributed across the broader base of the LifeApps&#174; suite of products.

&#160;

LifeApps&#174; will continue to explore acquisitions of companies, developers and publishers relating to our sports, health and fitness communities. In addition, the Company will also explore consumer related products as well. Such acquisitions will be considered where the purchase can help increase our revenues, as in the previous acquisition of Sports One Group, or enable the Company to attain assets that will allow us to gain technological advances that would be more costly to develop than to purchase.

&#160;

As traditional healthcare IT spending moves to mobile telemedicine, the Health market is projected to continue to grow from its current state as an emerging market into a diverse mix of healthcare services, providers, developers and researchers. The company believes that it is important to continue our development efforts in this category, however generating significant near-term revenues may prove to be challenging.

&#160;

Now more than ever, people are constantly looking for ways to not only stay healthy, yet to improve their health. In fact, the Affordable Care Act encourages employer wellness programs by offering companies financial incentives and provides Medical beneficiaries with a free annual &#34;wellness visit&#34; as well as vaccinations and free screening for cholesterol and cancer. In September 2015 it was reported by Healthcare IT News, there were 165,000 health related mobile apps available.

&#160;

LifeApps&#174; will continue a multi-pronged approach to the mHealth fitness and sports markets. As opportunities arise from the emergence of these rapidly evolving mobile hardware and software markets LifeApps&#174; will focus resources where they will be the most effective at growing the business and driving revenues.

&#160; 

Proposed Advisory Board 

&#160;

As more resources become available, LifeApps&#174; plans to create an Advisory Board to help grow its business. To better understand the markets we are entering, and to make sure our products are of the highest quality and relevance to users, LifeApps&#174; will invite professional athletes, subject matter experts, industry specialists and media and technology experts to join the Advisory Board. These individuals will sit in on Company meetings, visit trade-shows and industry events, and provide their recommendations and advice to us. Individuals will be appointed to the Advisory Board for a period of one year, and can be asked to continue serving on the Advisory Board annually.

&#160; 

Our Products 

&#160; 

LifeApps Mobile App Platform 

&#160;

LifeApps&#8217; iOS Tutorial App Platform is an icon based user interface that is familiar to anyone who has used a smartphone. With customization from icon shapes, icon frames, icon flags, and color selection (frames and menu bars), each app can be given a familiar yet distinct design. Users can also replace backgrounds and key imagery with photos from their camera or photo library.

&#160;

Within the app itself, tutorial pages can be navigated by simply swiping between pages. How-To photos are presented through automatically playing slideshows using clear, high-quality photography.

&#160;

Utilizing the familiar icon-based drag-and-drop system, exercise routines can be easily customized and arranged. This allows users the flexibility to choose from the entire library of tutorials to create their own playlists. For instance, a user can create a unique routine for each day of the week.

&#160;

This platform also boasts a robust data management system that allows for data recording on an element-by-element basis. All fields can be fully customized and the data can be displayed and aggregated.

&#160;

The LifeApps Mobile App Platform has been updated to integrate with Apple&#8217;s HealthKit. This integration improves the experience of the apps allowing them to both send and receive fitness and health data with other HealthKit enabled apps and sensory devices.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Video Management is a key element to the platform as well. Within the app&#8217;s video management system users can download video content, see how much memory space they have available and see how much space the video is using. They can also remove videos to free up space on their devices. Video can be grouped into categories and made available as free downloads or through in-app purchases.

&#160;

Social Media is integrated into the app, allowing users to share their data via Facebook, Twitter and email. A robust online Push-Alerts manager has been created, allowing for scheduled delivery to the users of the app of push alerts, messages sent from an app that update users as to new content. These messages are short and appear as an alert on the user&#8217;s home screen when received.

&#160;

Within the app, an HTML based messaging center allows for additional, more robust communication to the users. These messages can be as long as desired and can include photo and video embeds, just like any web page. Delivery of these messages is also managed through a robust online manager and can be scheduled for future delivery.

&#160;

LifeApps&#174; believes that the tutorial app is the next evolution of the DVD tutorial. With the one-and-you&#8217;re-done nature of DVD production and the reliance on a relatively immobile delivery device, the DVD is becoming less relevant in today&#8217;s fast-paced mobile world. Mobile apps can deliver all of the same content plus interactivity and data processing. Mobile apps are also &#8220;always with you&#8221; on your mobile device, eliminating the need for finding something to play the content on. Users are also able to receive additional content, messages, and even advertising from within the app, adding value and convenience that the traditional video tutorial can&#8217;t deliver.

&#160;

LifeApps&#174; is building in-house apps on the LifeApps iOS Tutorial App Platform and is looking to drive Company revenues by releasing LifeApps&#174; brands, such as MDWorkout&#174;, and licensing and developing apps with partners utilizing this platform.

&#160; 

Fitness and Sports Consumer Products with Mobile Apps 

&#160;

We continue to seek out innovative fitness consumer products where we can replace a traditional DVD tutorial with a mobile application. To that end, we are pursuing a strategy of building our own products combined with seeking agreements with companies with whom we can partner to bring such companies&#8217; products to market with our enhanced formats. One market in particular the Company plans to explore is the growing athletic leisure market a/k/a &#34;athleisure&#34;. According to a October 2015 Morgan Stanley report &#34;Global Athletic Wear: Very Bullish Five-Year Outlook&#34;. Morgan Stanley also predicts by 202, active wear will represent $83 billion in sales.

&#160;

LifeApps&#174; has established manufacturing relationships with certain companies to produce our fitness and sports products and we are building new media, e-commerce/mobile-commerce and traditional wholesale and resale distribution channels to deliver these products in our new physical-tied-to-mobile fitness packaged product format.

&#160; 

Sports One Group 

&#160;

Sports One is a digital platform that matches sports apparel manufacturers with distributors and purchasers. The overall custom apparel business is a $20 billion per year market. Sports One already has top-tier apparel manufacturing relationships and boasts product lines across all major sports communities including: soccer, football, baseball, lacrosse, tennis, etc. Sports One is continuing to expand the business through enhanced e-commerce/mobile-commerce toolsets and new strategic sales partnerships. Sports One is currently expanding its customer database, building sales channels and increasing its presence in supplier/distribution marketplaces. Sports One will also be expanding its efforts to include attendance at sports and fitness expos in an effort to drive sales and brand awareness.

&#160; 

Digital Publications 

&#160;

YouWorkout Digital Magazine is LifeApps&#8217; sports, health and fitness publication. The magazine is available only through digital mobile devices and can be found on Google Play, Amazon Kindle Fire and the Apple App Store. YouWorkout is a health, fitness and sports entertainment platform that features content from award winning journalists, top-tier athlete interviews and lifestyle content for health and fitness enthusiasts.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

This publication is an interactive experience using the touch interface of today&#8217;s mobile devices. It also boasts HD video, audio content and HD photography. Since its inception, the magazine has attracted champions including worldwide soccer superstar David Beckham featured on our most popular cover and in an exclusive interview, Stanley Cup Champions L.A. Kings forward Brad Richardson in an exclusive interview, two time gold medalist Rachel Buehler on the first cover and in an exclusive interview, and PGA star Rickie Fowler. YouWorkout has an ever growing and extensive library of athlete interviews, photos, videos and exclusives. YouWorkout is already recognized as a leading publication by both industry professionals and consumers alike. In the past, YouWorkout was a Top 5 &#8220;What&#8217;s Hot&#8221; publication in the Apple App Store category for an amazing 16 weeks in a row, from the end of 2012 through early 2013. The back issues and YouWorkout Lifestyle continue to be available in the various app stores.

&#160;

LifeApps&#174; has built an internal and external network of journalists, photographers and creative and technical experts that will allow us to now create additional publications in new entertainment sectors. This network will enable us to publish across new platforms as they arise.

&#160;

LifeApps&#174; is looking for opportunities to monetize the YouWorkout brand outside of the magazine publication. Future new releases are dependent upon the company establishing co-publishing agreements with third party publishers and financing.

&#160; 

Revenue 

&#160;

LifeApps&#174; intends to monetize and drive revenue across health, fitness and sports communities through a combination of its software development, e-commerce/mobile-commerce of sports apparel, consumer fitness products, mobile applications and in-app sales, subscriptions and advertising across all platforms.

&#160;

LifeApps&#174; seeks to continue a multi-pronged approach to the mHealth fitness and sports markets. As opportunities arise from the emergence of these rapidly evolving mobile hardware and software markets LifeApps&#174; will focus resources where they will be the most effective at growing both the long-term business objectives and driving immediate revenues.

&#160;

The company continues to pursue partnerships with healthcare providers who are expanding into mobile health. As traditional healthcare looks to expand its telemedicine offerings, the mobile health market will grow from its current state as an emerging market into a diverse mix of healthcare services, providers, developers and insurance providers. The company believes that it is important to continue our software and business development efforts in the category. We believe this is a significant and important core business to the company long-term, however generating significant near-term revenues from our mobile medicine platform may prove to be challenging.

&#160; 

LifeApps Mobile App Platform 

&#160;

LifeApps&#174; intends to continue to develop and license the LifeApps Mobile App Platform. We will research and seek out aligned companies with need for tutorial based apps for mobile and we will work to create new revenue through development and licensing of our presentation format for their use. We will pursue a business model of physical-tied-to-mobile fitness products, combining mobile app training with a physical retail product. Additionally, LifeApps&#174; will continue to build and improve our own tutorial sports, health and fitness apps, such as MDWorkout&#174;. We will be launching additional gateway apps, skills, drills and training apps, and physical-tied-to-mobile fitness products in 2015. With this new platform and the capabilities it offers, LifeApps&#174; expects to drive revenues through app sales, in-app marketing and in-app purchases of enhanced content. MDWorkout&#174; is now available through IMS Health AppScript allowing healthcare providers to prescribe the application.

&#160; 

Sports One Group 

&#160;

Sports One Group is our digital e-commerce wholesaler of sports apparel. Through additional apparel manufacturing partnerships, increased design and decoration services and improving the e-commerce and mobile-commerce tools for customers, LifeApps&#174; is expanding Sports One&#8217;s presence in the promotional apparel market. We believe that by increasing customer awareness through expanding our presence at health and fitness expos and improving the customer experience we can drive the growth of Sports One sales. With enhanced e-commerce/mobile-commerce tools and Private Labeling of the Sports One catalogue with key sales partners, LifeApps&#174; is developing a suite of tools and enhanced customer experiences that will enable the Company to scale this business through technology.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

YouWorkout 

&#160;

YouWorkout back-issues will continue to be available in the app stores. LifeApps&#174; is pursuing advertisers and publishing partners for future issues. LifeApps&#174; will build out the brand so that it can be expanded through line extensions across our entire line of sports, health and fitness communities. This will allow us to boost YouWorkout&#8217;s visibility through cross-promotions across our entire customer base. The opportunity exists for LifeApps&#174; to also serve as a publisher for other companies to enter the digital publication marketplace

&#160; 

Additional Areas of Interest 

&#160;

LifeApps&#174; is continuing to pursue aligned product offerings in several key sports, health and fitness communities including, but not limited to, soccer, yoga and running. The Company will be opportunistic and will pursue promising opportunities when they present themselves. We will work with our associated subject matter experts to strategize, research and plan new products in these areas of interest. Certain areas in the medical industry are also appealing to the Company, plus the marketing within the athletic leisure market as well as women's health and lifestyle.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s acquisition strategy of purchasing companies, development resources and assets that are aligned with our areas of interest can further aid in our entering additional market segments. We will actively research and engage in the acquisition of resources that can expedite our entrance into new markets, or strengthen our position in existing ones.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

The development, distribution and sale of digital publications and apps is a highly competitive business, characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidly emerging new platforms, technologies and storefronts. For end users, we compete primarily on the basis of quality, brand, customer reviews and price. We compete for promotional and deck placement based on these factors, as well as the relationship with the digital storefront owner or wireless carrier, historical performance, perception of sales potential and relationships with licensors of brands and other intellectual property. For content and brand licensors, we compete based on royalty and other economic terms, perceptions of development quality, porting abilities, speed of execution, distribution breadth and relationships with storefront owners or carriers. We also compete for experienced and talented employees.

&#160;

With respect to digital publications and apps that we publish for smartphones and tablets, we compete with a continually increasing number of companies, including Meredith Publishing, WebMD and many well-funded private companies. We also compete for consumer spending with large companies, such as NIKE and Electronic Arts. In addition, given the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets, we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch digital publications and apps and other content for these mobile devices utilizing relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. The proliferation of titles in these open developer channels makes it difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from other developers and to compete for end users who purchase content for their smartphones and tablets without substantially increasing spending to market our products or increasing our development costs.

&#160;

With respect to physical retail products we face many of the same challenges from large companies such as NIKE and Puma. In-particular, the golf fitness subcategory is a relatively new market overall. As an early player in the market we do have the advantage of being an early leader. As larger companies begin to focus on this market the level of competition will dramatically increase. This may affect our ability to differentiate our product or to gain exposure.

&#160;

Some of our competitors&#8217; and our potential competitors&#8217; advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, include the following:

&#160;

significantly greater revenues and financial resources;

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

stronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide;

&#160;

greater experience with the digital publications and apps business model;

&#160;

the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products;

&#160;

larger installed customer bases from related platforms such as console gaming or social networking websites to which they can market and sell mobile games;

&#160;

more substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having to pay royalties;

&#160;

lower labor and development costs and better overall economies of scale;

&#160;

greater resources to make acquisitions;

&#160;

greater platform-specific focus, experience and expertise; and

&#160;

broader global distribution and presence.

&#160;

For more information on our competition, please see the risk factors described below.

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160;

We are subject to a number of domestic and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. Not only are these laws constantly evolving, which could result in them being interpreted in ways that could harm our business, but legislation is also continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution.

&#160;

We are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the protection of the information that we collect regarding our users. We currently collect certain personally identifiable information regarding our customers, and expect in the future to collect additional personally identifiable information regarding our customers. Any concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results. We post our privacy policy and our terms of service on our corporate website. In these policies, we describe our practices concerning the use, transmission and disclosure of the information that we collect regarding our users. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policy, terms of service or privacy related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. In addition, the interpretation of data protection laws, and their application to the mobile gaming industry is unclear and in a state of flux. There is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to region, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our users&#8217; privacy and data could result in a loss of player confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of users, which could adversely affect our business.

&#160;

In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California&#8217;s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.

&#160;

We sometimes offer our customers various types of sweepstakes, giveaways and promotional opportunities. We are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of such activities and games, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. Any court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services could result in criminal or civil liability and could harm our business.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, the advertisers that advertise with our apps are subject to Federal Trade Commission and state rules on advertising and marketing on the Internet, including truth-in advertising rules, online advertising disclosures and the CAN-SPAM Act (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act) of 2003. To date, we have not been materially impacted by these rules because our platforms are designed to ensure that proper disclosures are made in connection with every publication. We cannot predict the impact of future regulations on either us or advertisers that advertise with our apps.

&#160;

Further, because our services are available worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions and others may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 2 employees, all of whom are full time employees. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.

&#160; 

Properties 

&#160;

Our principal executive office is located at Polo Plaza, 3790 Via De La Valle #116, Del Mar, CA 92014 and our telephone number is (858) 577-0500. The property is currently being rented on a month to month basis at a rate of $715 per month.

&#160; 

Legal Proceedings 

&#160;

We are, from time to time, a party to litigation that arises in the normal course of our business operations. Currently, no legal proceedings, government actions, administrative actions, investigations or claims are pending against us or involve us that, in the opinion of our management, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

&#160; 

Available Information 

&#160;

We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). Reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, including annual and quarterly reports, and other reports we file, can be inspected and copied at the public reference facilities maintained by the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.
