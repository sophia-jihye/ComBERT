 Item 1. Business. 

&#160;

Sharing Services, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on April 24, 2015 and established a fiscal year end of April 30. On November 1, 2015, the Company launched its TaxiCabSharing.com website and app where consumers can schedule a taxi cab ride and find someone who is in close proximity with them and who is going to the same vicinity as their destination. The Company intends to market its taxi sharing services, via social media services such as Twitter and Facebook.

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

We plan on developing mobile and desktop software applications so we can provide services to our end user customers enabling them to share the cost of a taxi. Our initial software applications will be a web application (web app) designed to operate within an Internet browser such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Internet Explorer. Once completed our next applications will be for mobile devices (operating on the Google Android and Apple iOS operating systems) and our initial target market will be end users who are at an airport and intend on going into the main city center serviced by that airport with a primary focus on travelers that arrive at an airport and need to get to their hotel and then return from that same destination hotel back to that same airport. Our top priority is to build a service that will make our end users' lives easier.

&#160;

Initially, our applications (both web and mobile) will focus on providing a simple and efficient way for our end users to (1) enter their destination, (2) enter their departure time &#8211; in 15 minutes, in 30 minutes or now, (3) view the profile of and chat with potential ride share candidates to discuss a meeting place and rules of fare sharing &#8211; such as 50/50 equal sharing or 40/60 first out of the taxi sharing, and (4) to confirm and book the taxi share. 

&#160;

Subsequent updates to our applications (both web and mobile) will be focused on adding feature enhancements while always improving the ease of use of our software applications as we believe this is key to end user adoption of our services. Intended feature enhancements include: (A) manually scheduling a taxi share while arranging travel plans; (B) connecting our software applications with third-party travel websites to allow our end users to schedule a taxi share based upon their travel itinerary; and (C) easily scheduling a return-to-airport-of-origin taxi share.

&#160;

We plan on generating revenue through a booking confirmation fee that will be based upon the number of taxi shares and would expire at the end of one year from the date of activation. Our planned taxi share packages and the expected costs would be:

As of the date of this annual report filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K, we have not yet developed our mobile software applications, but have completed initial development of our website and web app, which are located at http://TaxiCabSharing.com . We have no end users, we have not yet contacted any possible mobile software application developers and we have only implemented an initial part of our business model and we have generated no revenues.

&#160;

Market Opportunity and Value Proposition 

&#160;

- Long lines for getting a taxi at an airport can be observed as a common situation. Our service, which will be provided to end users via our software applications, is intended to reduce these lines and waiting time by connecting people going in the same direction. It is often the case that people are travelling alone and taking a taxi alone, not being aware of the fact that there might be someone else taking the same route as they are. This is where we intend to step in &#8211; we intend to help people save money by sharing their taxi fare. In this era of a global economic crisis, saving money is of high importance to many &#8211; even business people. &#160;

&#160;

- Our taxi sharing service is intended to provide convenience to users &#8211; it's intended to be an easy and stress-free way to find someone to share a taxi ride with and to share the expense. &#160;

&#160;

- Another beneficial aspect of our service is the social aspect &#8211; it is intended to enable users to connect with other people and meet new friends. &#160;

&#160;

- It can be stated that taxi sharing is environmentally friendly since it's reducing the number of vehicles in use and thus reduces the emission of carbon dioxide.

Due to the nature of our business services, we believe that we can offer our services internationally, however we intend to target the following markets initially: the United States; Canada; and Western Europe. 

&#160;

Our sole officer and director resides in Thailand and as such does not intend to travel to negotiate with individuals and companies in respect of developing and marketing our services. These communications will be dealt with via email, telephone and via the Internet, using services such as Skype.

&#160;

Marketing Plan 

&#160;

Our taxi sharing services are primarily planned to be marketed to end user consumers from our website located at http://www.TaxiCabSharing.com. We also intend to advertise our taxi sharing services in inflight magazines, on travel related websites and in the social media (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) In addition to this we have identified potential key marketing partners that could benefit our marketing efforts.

&#160;

Our marketing campaign is planned to start after the successful completion of the development of our software applications (web and mobile). We expect to start our initial Internet marketing campaign after we have raised enough funds to start implementing our Second Phase of our Plan of Operations and have software applications (web and mobile) available for use by end user consumers. We have not yet finalized all aspects of our marketing plan but below we outline some marketing opportunities and methods we have identified.

&#160;

Our inflight magazine marketing plan may include one or more of the following publications:

&#160;

- United Airlines Hemispheres &#160;

&#160;

- Delta Airlines Sky &#160;

&#160;

- Southwest Airlines Spirit &#160;

&#160;

- US Airways Magazine &#160;

&#160;

- American Airlines American Way and NEXOS &#160;

&#160;

- Air Canada enRoute &#160;

&#160;

- Westjet UP! 

&#160;

&#160; 4 

&#160; 

&#160;

Potential key marketing partners may include one or more of the following:

&#160;

- Taxi associations &#8211; Taxi associations could benefit from our taxi sharing service as it could potentially bring more customers to them. By using our software applications taxi drivers could monitor potential customers nearby and connect with these customers before they find another taxi. &#160;

&#160;

- Airline Companies &#8211; Airline companies could recommend our taxi sharing service to their customers; and in return, we could provide them with advertising space in our software applications. &#160;

&#160;

- Airports &#8211; We could provide free Wi-Fi hotspots at airports where people could use our software applications to find travelling companions as soon as they get off a plane, without the need to connect using their mobile data plan on their mobile device. &#160;

&#160;

- Hotels &#8211; Hotels could recommend our taxi sharing service to their customers who are arriving by plane to connect these customers with other people customers also coming to their hotel; and in return, we could provide them with advertising space in our software applications. 

&#160;

We have not yet contacted, researched or secured any kind of agreement and/or contract with any in-flight magazine or travel related website or with any social media marketing consultant(s).

&#160;

Key to our future success will be our taking advantage of successful customer relationships with our end user consumers in order to market virally through these end user consumers to their network of friends, family and co-workers. This form of viral marketing is considered low-cost yet it can be extremely successful in driving new end users consumers to our taxi sharing service.

&#160;

We intend to provide our end user consumers with technical support, which will try to resolve their issues as soon as possible.

&#160;

We intend to reach out to our end user consumers through social media channels and try to increase our level of engagement with them to show them that we are listening to them and want to hear from them.

&#160;

We believe that listening to end user consumers' needs is of crucial importance for creating user-friendly software applications that people would like to use and would be willing to recommend to their friends, family and co-workers. We intend to constantly improve our software applications based on the feedback from our end user consumers. Thus we intend to build a strong connection full of trust with our end user consumers who will know that their opinion matters. 

&#160;

The general audiences we intend to target are airport passengers, who are looking for a way to decrease the cost of taking a taxi to their destination, more specifically:

&#160;

- Young travelers who might have financial benefits since our taxi sharing service will offer them a cost efficient way of getting to their destination. &#160;

&#160;

- Airline passengers using low-cost airlines since they seem more open to finding inexpensive ways of transportation. &#160;

&#160;

- Economy class passengers who also might be willing to share the taxi fare and save a reasonable amount of money. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We believe that our taxi sharing services would be beneficial for a great number of end user consumers, ranging from the frequent flyer to the once-a-year vacationer. We consider our service model innovative and we have no knowledge of any other service similar to the one we intend to offer.

&#160;

The vast majority of taxi software applications currently available on the market offer only the service of finding a taxi, not sharing one. The most popular taxi software applications are: Uber , Lyft , Sidecar , Hailo, EasyTaxi and GrabTaxi .

&#160;

- Uber 

&#160;

Uber is a ridesharing service which connects riders and drivers via their smartphone applications. A user first sets up a pick up location, requests a ride, waits for a driver to accept, and then enters a desired location. The payment is handled through Uber, and not to the driver directly. Fares are charged automatically to the rider's credit card.

&#160;

As far as the choice of vehicles is concerned, Uber offers UberTaxi, UberBlack, UberSUV and UberLUX. In 2012, Uber launched UberX program that hires qualified drivers with acceptable cars. This service offers everyday cars which are significantly cheaper than a taxi. Uber has also launched UberPOOL which enables riders who request a ride along a similar route to share a ride and split the fare. If the match is found, both users get a discounted fare.

&#160;

Uber's software applications are available for free on the Apple App Store, Google Play Store and Windows Phone Store.

&#160;

Uber is available in 58 countries and more than 300 cities worldwide. Website: uber.com

- Lyft 

&#160;

Lyft is a share transit system which connects riders with drivers. It offers riders three ways to ride: Lyft, Lyft Line and Lyft Plus. With Lyft a rider requests a pickup and gets connected with a driver within minutes. A rider will see a photo of the driver so as to recognize him/her upon arrival (Lyft cars are marked by pink moustaches.) When the ride is finished, the Lyft software application charges the rider's credit card. Lyft Line connects the rider to another rider on their route and riders pay a discounted price. Lyft Plus is meant for larger groups (up to six riders), or if a rider needs extra space.

&#160;

As far as safety is concerned, riders are insured with Lyft's insurance protection plan. Drivers undergo thorough background checks; cars must be model year 2000 or newer; riders and drivers rate each other thus maintaining a level of high quality (if a driver's average falls under 4.6 out of 5, they are no longer available.) 

&#160;

Lyft's software applications are available for free on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

&#160;

Lyft operates in about 65 U.S. cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City, with plans to expand domestically and internationally. Website: lyft.com

Riders can also share a ride with another person going the same way and cut the cost. Riders can also pick their favorite driver and add them to their favorites list. Payments are automatically made through the software application to a rider's credit card.

&#160;

As far as the safety is concerned, all drivers go through security check, all rides are GPS tracked, every ride is insured, and all vehicles must be model year 2000 or later. Sidecar is currently available in 10 U.S. cities.
