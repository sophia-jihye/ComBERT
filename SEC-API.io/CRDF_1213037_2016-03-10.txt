 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

We are a molecular diagnostic company that focuses on the development and commercialization of a proprietary molecular diagnostic technology for use in disease detection and monitoring across a variety of medical disciplines. Our primary internal focus is to leverage our novel cell-free molecular diagnostic platform to facilitate improvements in the field of oncology, while our external focus includes entering into license agreements or collaborations to develop our technology in areas such as infectious disease, transplant medicine and prenatal genetics. 

&#160; 

We are leveraging our proprietary molecular diagnostic technology for the detection of cell-free DNA originating from diseased cell death that can be isolated and detected from urine, blood, and tissue samples to improve disease management. These genetic materials are also collectively referred to as &#8220;cell-free nucleic acids&#8221;, which result when cells in the body die and release their DNA contents into the bloodstream. The circulating fragments of genetic material are eventually filtered through the kidneys, and therefore, can be detected and measured in urine. Cell-free nucleic acids can be used as genetic markers of disease. As such, the contents of urine or blood samples represent systemic liquid biopsies that allow for simple, non-invasive or minimally-invasive sample collection methods. 

&#160; 

Our fundamental cell-free molecular diagnostic platform for oncology applications, also known as our &#8220;Precision Cancer Monitoring &#174; &#8221; (&#8220;PCM&#8221;) platform, is protected by a strong intellectual property portfolio. We have developed significant intellectual property around cell-free nucleic acids in urine, and the extraction of cell-free nucleic acids from urine, as well as novel assay designs, particularly our proprietary non-naturally occurring primers. Through this proprietary technology, we believe that we are at the forefront of a shift in the way diagnostic medicine is practiced, using simple, non-invasive or minimally invasive sampling and analysis of nucleic acids, which we believe will ultimately lead to more effective treatment monitoring, better management of serious illnesses such as cancer, and the ability to detect the success of cancer treatment, the recurrence of cancer, or the progression of cancer earlier. As of December 31, 2015 , our intellectual property portfolio consisted of over 85 issued patents and over 60 pending patent applications in the U.S. and abroad. Our patent estate includes the detection of cell-free nucleic acids that pass through the kidney into the urine, as well as their application in specific disease areas, including oncology, infectious disease, transplantation, and prenatal genetics. 

&#160; 

We believe that our proprietary PCM platform is uniquely positioned to address a high unmet clinical need in the field of oncology. Our PCM platform is designed to offer better cancer monitoring by tracking and quantifying levels of cell-free DNA from either urine or blood samples, and is intended to provide important clinical information beyond the current standard of care. Using urine as a sample, our cancer monitoring technology enables frequent, non-invasive monitoring of oncogene mutation status, disease progression and disease recurrence. Our extensive research and development efforts were strengthened, due to investments to expand our intellectual property portfolio, and were made commercially feasible following improved next-generation sequencing (&#8220;NGS&#8221;) technologies, which are now available at a significantly lower cost. This combined with our extensive patent portfolio around cell-free DNA in urine gives us a competitive advantage to leverage an emerging trend of monitoring cancer using cell-free DNA as a marker of disease status. Our proprietary sample preparation process forms the basis of our PCM platform. It includes novel technology for the extraction and isolation of cell-free DNA from either a urine or blood sample, proprietary non-naturally occurring primers to enrich the sample for mutant alleles and the ability to detect nucleic acids of interest using one of several leading gene sequencing technologies such as NGS or droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (&#8220;ddPCR&#8221;). We believe that our quantitative cell-free DNA detection and monitoring platform offers industry leading sensitivity, featuring single nucleic acid molecule detection. 

&#160; 

Our PCM platform is poised to overcome a significant clinical dilemma in the area of cancer treatment. Recent scientific evidence supports the molecular basis of cancer and has resulted in a paradigm shift in the way cancer is diagnosed and treated. Researchers and clinicians are now focused on specific oncogene mutations and alterations that are believed to be the drivers of cancer at the molecular level, and, as a result, there is a trend in the pharmaceutical research community toward developing targeted therapies. As such, there is a need for oncologists to have an ability to track the mutational status of their patients and to assess a given patient&#8217;s response to treatments designed to target driver oncogene mutations. Current monitoring tools such as imaging procedures, tissue biopsy and circulating tumor cells are insufficient to meet the challenge of monitoring oncogene mutations. Imaging only provides a rough indication of tumor size and is an important tool for surgeons, but provides little practical information to oncologists regarding mutational status and appropriate treatment options, especially for molecular targeted therapies. Tissue biopsy usually involves a surgical procedure and, in many cases, is not repeatable as there are limitations related to access for serial biopsies. In some cases, biopsies may not be available, significantly increasing the need to determine mutational status using an alternative method. In addition, tumor heterogeneity is important, as the surgeon may not obtain the proper tissue from the tumor sample. In the case of circulating tumor cells, which are typically measured using blood tests, sensitivity is traditionally low, and such tests can be technically difficult and expensive to conduct. 

Targeted drug therapies themselves are not without issues. Targeted therapies are typically very expensive, can have significant side effects and are not effective in every patient. In order to measure effectiveness, repeated monitoring is needed and serial biopsies can be difficult to obtain. If resistance develops, fast and accurate detection of emerging or changing oncogene mutation status is critical. Our PCM platform provides a novel solution using urine, a non-invasive, plentiful sample source, and we are continuing to build a growing body of evidence supporting the clinical utility of our technology to monitor cancer using cell-free DNA. 

&#160; 

Our goal is to improve treatment outcomes for cancer patients using our proprietary technology to detect and quantitatively monitor cell-free DNA using a urine or blood sample. 

&#160; 

Developing a Market for Molecular Diagnostic Tests based on Liquid Biopsies using Cell-free DNA 

&#160; 

We intend to develop and expand our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology into a pipeline of potentially groundbreaking commercial molecular detection and monitoring products. Our Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (&#8220;CLIA&#8221;)-certified, College of American Pathologists (&#8220;CAP&#8221;)-accredited laboratory in San Diego, California will enable us to initially commercialize our testing services and launch our platform technology and associated innovative molecular monitoring tests. Urine-based cell-free molecular diagnostics can provide relevant information across multiple therapeutic and clinical areas, and may lead to improvements in patient management. We are focused on the oncology treatment market and the opportunity to enable clinicians to track oncogene mutational status in cancer patients. Repeat testing is expected with most cancer patients, and there also exists a need to chronically monitor for the re-emergence of oncogenenic mutations in people that are cancer survivors. 

&#160; 

In order to facilitate early availability and use of our products and technologies, in February 2012, we acquired the CLIA laboratory assets of MultiGEN Diagnostics, Inc. (&#8220;MultiGEN&#8221;), which included CLIA approval and licensing documentation, laboratory procedures, customer lists and marketing materials. A CLIA lab is a clinical reference laboratory that can perform high complexity diagnostic assays (e.g., those requiring polymerase chain reaction (&#8220;PCR&#8221;) amplification). Through this CLIA laboratory, we are able to offer laboratory developed tests (&#8220;LDTs&#8221;) in compliance with CLIA guidelines. 

&#160; 

Targeting cell-free nucleic acid markers will allow for the development of genetic tests that use non-invasive and easy-to-obtain urine samples, rather than other more traditional and more invasive methods. These methods include medical imaging, blood testing, and tissue biopsies. We are exploring a broad range of clinical utilities where cell-free nucleic acid technology holds the potential to replace more complex, less robust existing technologies. We are developing more effective, non-invasive diagnostics, which align with the current industry shift toward highly personalized medicine. Urine-based cell-free nucleic acid molecular tests can make it easier to address important health problems and may lead to significant advancements in patient care. 

&#160; 

Our patented technology uses safe, non-invasive, cost effective, and simple urine collection, which can be applied to a broad range of testing, including tumor mutation detection and monitoring, infectious disease monitoring, transplantation monitoring and prenatal genetic diagnostics. We believe that our technology is ideally suited to be used in developing molecular diagnostic assays that will allow physicians to provide simple, non-invasive, and convenient screening and monitoring tests for their patients by identifying specific biomarkers involved in a disease process. Our novel urine-based assays can facilitate improved testing compliance, resulting in a more effective use of targeted therapies, earlier detection of disease and disease progression or recurrence, and improvements in both patient outcomes and cost of care.

The Basis for Our Urine-based Molecular Diagnostic Technology 

&#160; 

Cell-free nucleic acids have been found in a variety of human bodily fluids, with the nucleic acids isolated from urine having been extensively characterized. Cell-free nucleic acids in urine have been proven to contain mutated DNA and other markers of disease, including microRNA. In contrast to other bodily fluids (e.g., blood plasma), urine allows for truly non-invasive collection of the sample, provides a larger sample size, and allows for frequent collection. Importantly, urine enables the collection of nucleic acid material from the systemic circulation over a period of time, and those DNA and RNA fragments remain stable in urine. These factors, combined with recently developed technologies to sequence, count, and track nucleic acids with low relative abundance, make the development of our non-invasive diagnostics commercially practical and scalable. 

&#160; 

In the human body, about 10 11 &#160;- 10 12 cells die each day primarily as a consequence of natural physiological processes for tissue and organ maintenance, but also as a result of disease. Together, these dead and dying cells contain more than one gram of DNA, which is mostly degraded into short fragments by specific enzymes. A small proportion of these cell-free nucleic acids escapes complete degradation and appears in the bloodstream. Our scientists were the first to discover that circulating cell-free nucleic acids cross the kidney barrier and can be found in the urine as cell-free DNA. This simple yet remarkable discovery that genetic information from various cells throughout the body is present in urine enabled the development of new, non-invasive techniques for molecular diagnostics and genetic testing. 

&#160; 

To unlock the full potential of cell-free nucleic acids, we have developed a proprietary method for the isolation of the short fragmented nucleic acids that pass through the kidneys, and proprietary &#8220;ultra-short&#8221; amplicon assays necessary for the efficient detection of cell-free nucleic acids, which can be analyzed at our San Diego-based CLIA laboratory. 

&#160; 

Because of the small size of cell-free nucleic acids in urine, having an isolation method that efficiently captures short nucleic acids is critical. We have multiple methods (patents and pending patents) for the isolation of nucleic acids from bodily fluids, including urine. Many nucleic isolation methods are not properly suited for the isolation of cell-free nucleic acids in urine. For example, many DNA isolation kits only capture DNA greater than 200 base-pairs (&#8220;bp&#8221;) in length, with a few claiming 100 bp or longer. No manufacturer states that their product is suitable to capture DNA sequences shorter than 80 bp in length. 

&#160; 

When compared to leading kits for the isolation of DNA from bodily fluids, we have observed, by conducting internal studies, that our method is three to twenty times more efficient in isolating a 50 bp target. Our method is also suitable for the isolation of RNA, including miRNAs. 

&#160; 

In addition to our cell-free nucleic acid isolation method, we have developed our technology for detecting ultra-short amplicons (patents pending). By combining our proprietary nucleic acid isolation method with our ultra-short amplicon assays, we are able to detect at least six times more mutations in a urine-based cell-free DNA sample than any other PCR-based assay, according to our internal test data. We believe that these methods are also applicable to other small or fragmented nucleic acids, including cell-free DNA from blood and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples. 

&#160; 

Determining DNA and RNA signatures using urine as a &#8220;systemic biopsy&#8221; may provide a more powerful and effective tool for following and uncovering both pre-clinical and clinical changes, which may include:

&#8226; 

monitoring cancer patients to determine therapeutic response or non-response and disease recurrence; 

&#8226; 

determining mutational status when tissue biopsy is unavailable or infeasible; 

&#8226; 

monitoring for minimal residual disease (&#8220;MRD&#8221;) after surgical resection of a malignant tumor, following organ transplant status to watch for rejection; 

&#8226; 

non-invasively securing samples for the clinical diagnosis of infectious diseases; and 

&#8226; 

screening and testing expectant mothers, whose fetuses may be at risk for certain genetic abnormalities. 

&#160; 

Currently, these clinical needs are addressed by the use of invasive blood and bone marrow tests, tissue biopsies, and amniocentesis, as well as costly CT, MRI, and PET scans. 

&#160; 

Urine is a relatively simple aqueous solution and, unlike plasma, contains few components that can attack and break down cell-free nucleic acid fragments. Cell-free nucleic acid fragments can be accurately analyzed using conventional methods that are either in use or in development within many molecular genomics laboratories. 

&#160; 

Our urine-based cell-free nucleic acid tests are based upon a proprietary method of nucleic acid isolation, followed by detection of specific genetic markers. These proven and well-established detection methods can also be used to detect nucleic acids in blood, stool, and other specimen types. Using enhancements of these techniques, cell-free nucleic acid markers can be isolated from easily obtained urine specimens. 

&#160; 

Our urine-based cell-free nucleic acid technology may be applied to the detection and monitoring of a broad spectrum of medical conditions. 

Characteristics of Urine-based Cell-free Nucleic Acid Testing 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

The kidney acts as a filter, passing cell-free nucleic acids from complex, multicellular, multicomponent blood into urine, a less complex aqueous environment. 

&#8226; 

The collection procedure is non-invasive and does not require the involvement of trained medical staff. 

&#8226; 

Urine as a sample type supports repeated testing when required and poses no discomfort for the patient. 

&#8226; 

Cell-free nucleic acids in urine are stable at room temperature for extended periods of time with the addition of a simple preservative. Nucleic acids in blood and many other traditional samples are not. 

&#8226; 

Sample processing and tests can often be easily automated. 

&#8226; 

Isolation of cell-free markers from large sample volumes increases sensitivity of the tests. This cannot be done as easily using blood or tissue specimens, which have inherent volume limitations. 

&#8226; 

Blood or sputum samples for detection of infectious diseases may not be easily obtained from certain patients, including small children and the elderly. Urine specimens typically present minimal acquisition concerns. 

&#8226; 

Blood and other bodily fluids can be highly infectious by nature, urine is not. 

&#8226; 

Blood and other bodily fluids are legally considered biohazardous, urine is not. 

&#160; 

Clinical Applications 

&#160; 

We believe that our urine-based cell-free molecular diagnostic tests will make it easier to address important health problems worldwide and will lead to significant advances in personalized medicine for improved patient care. We intend to 

develop clinical evidence for our cancer monitoring tests in three distinct and potentially overlapping stages. Stage 1 studies are qualitative in nature and are designed to determine the mutational status of actionable biomarkers in urine especially when biopsy is not an option. These studies demonstrate concordance (agreement) of the oncogene mutation status between a urine sample and a tumor tissue sample. These studies are considered to have diagnostic value and are designed to prove that urine-based molecular test results match the tissue biopsy closely. The clinical utility of such studies validate that mutational status of actionable biomarkers can be determined in urine when a tissue biopsy is not an option or is infeasible. Stage 2 studies are quantitative in nature and are designed to assess patient mutational status in urine longitudinally (over time) as an indicator of responsiveness to therapy and disease status of the patient. Stage 3 studies are conducted with the goal to demonstrate improved patient outcomes and eventually could lead to changing medical guidelines and establishment of a new clinical standard of care for managing certain cancers. Demonstrated clinical utility includes quantitatively assessing patient mutational status in urine longitudinally for mutational status as well as early detection of resistance to therapy as a decision tool for therapy selection. Generating clinical data with our technology that supports better patient outcomes and more efficient use of healthcare resources is a key component of Stage 3. 

&#160; 

We believe that there are several specific applications of our PCM platform technology with regard to helping oncologists monitor a patient&#8217;s mutational status, thereby optimizing the treatment approach and improving outcomes. Our technology can be used to determine a patient&#8217;s mutational status for the first time when a tissue biopsy is not feasible, or it can be used to monitor changes in mutational load over time to provide information that can be useful to direct treatment regimens. Should a patient have their tumor removed surgically, our technology can be used to broadly search for minimal residual disease, which can confirm a successful procedure or enable early detection of recurrent disease for improved patient management. Treatment-emergent mutations can also be a major problem and may be drivers of resistance to first-line therapy. Examples of this include the emergent mutation epidermal growth factor receptor (&#8220;EGFR&#8221;) T790M in lung cancer or KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer. Because our platform uses a non-invasive, easy to obtain sample from the patient, the ability to monitor more accurately and more often with fewer barriers to doing so can provide us with key competitive advantages in the marketplace, particularly with regard to monitoring for treatment-emergent mutations. 

Oncology 

&#160; 

Urine may offer an alternative to biopsy, medical imaging, and less optimal blood-based tests such as those that use circulating tumor cells. By tracking mutations, we can inform medical practice. Our initial pilot study was focused on the BRAF mutation because of its link to discreet cancers and associated treatments, as well as the KRAS mutation because of its broad applicability in many cancers. We are now developing oncogene tracking tests using ddPCR and NGS for a variety of mutations seen in many cancer types. We believe the potential exists to expand the use of these tracking tests across many cancer types for multiple mutations in test panels. 

&#160; 

During 2015, we had over 25 ongoing clinical studies with leading cancer centers and pharmaceutical companies to demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative clinical utility of our tests. Clinical study sites include MD Anderson Cancer Center, Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center, USC Norris Cancer Center, US Oncology, pharmaceutical collaborators, and other top cancer centers. In 2014 and 2015, we entered into clinical study collaboration agreements with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, City of Hope Comprehensive Care Center, and Genomac International Ltd. (also known as the Center for Applied Genomics of Solid Tumors, Genomac Research Institute), among others. 

&#160; 

Clinical proof of concept for KRAS and BRAF mutation assays 

&#160; 

The MD Anderson Cancer Center clinical study is focused on detecting and monitoring BRAF and KRAS tumor mutations in cell-free DNA from urine in metastatic cancer patients. BRAF mutations are common in melanoma, thyroid, and other cancers. Within the U.S., it is estimated that nearly 730,000 patients have tumors with BRAF mutations. Several targeted therapies are either on the market or in development for BRAF-mutation positive cancers. Pancreatic cancer represents an additional diagnostic and treatment challenge. Each year, more than 43,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer are diagnosed, and 37,000 patients succumb to this disease. It is estimated that KRAS mutations occur in greater than 90% of pancreatic cancers and 11%-17% of these patients do not express the CA19-9 marker, which makes their disease more difficult to track. 

&#160; 

Results from the MD Anderson Cancer Center clinical study were published at the AACR-NCI-EROTC International Conference in October 2013. During the study, urine samples from metastatic cancer patients known to have BRAF V600E, KRAS G12D or KRAS G12V mutations were assessed. Our researchers analyzed the urine samples using our urine-based cell-free molecular diagnostic assays. Results demonstrated high concordance between urine and tissue mutational status. In addition, preliminary results indicate that cell-free BRAF V600E mutation monitoring in urine correlates with clinical response to therapy. The clinical study demonstrated that BRAF V600E mutations were detected in urine irrespective of the cancer type, and a multitude of different cancer types, including brain cancer (&#8220;glioblastoma&#8221;), were included in the initial study results. 

The BRAF V600E assay demonstrated 95% concordance vs. tissue biopsy (both detected and borderline), and also demonstrated that urinary DNA can be used to detect DNA fragments from circulation that harbor tumor mutations. The following cancers were detected during the study: non-small cell lung cancer (&#8220;NSCLC&#8221;), papillary thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, adenocarcinoma of unknown primary, ovarian cancer, and appendiceal cancer. In addition, preliminary results indicate that cell-free BRAF V600E mutation monitoring in urine longitudinally correlates with clinical response to therapy. 

&#160; 

The study also evaluated the feasibility of using massively parallel deep sequencing (i.e., NGS) to identify DNA mutations in the urine of metastatic cancer patients harboring known KRAS mutations. Leveraging proprietary enrichment methods, our researchers were able to detect mutant cell-free DNA in the urine of cancer patients with verified KRAS mutations. 

&#160; 

CLIA validated BRAF mutation assay 

&#160; 

In October 2013, our first urine test for cancer mutation monitoring was made available to clinicians through our CLIA laboratory. The robustness of our ultra-sensitive assay procedure has been demonstrated for the detection of the BRAF V600E mutation from cell-free DNA in urine. This mutation commonly occurs in melanoma. Of the more than 70,000 cases of melanoma diagnosed each year in the U.S., up to 70 percent harbor a BRAF-type mutation and of those, 80 percent may be positive specifically for BRAF V600E. There are several approved targeted therapies for the treatment of BRAF-positive melanoma, making mutational status monitoring an area of clinical interest among treating physicians. 

&#160; 

Our cell-free BRAF test is a laboratory deleloped test (&#8220;LDT&#8221;), designed to detect and monitor this mutation in metastatic cancer patients with biopsy-proven V600E BRAF mutation in their tumor. It is the first and only commercial assay within our cancer monitoring portfolio performed using a ddPCR platform. Using urine as a non-invasive, systemic sample, the cell-free BRAF test could help physicians monitor changes in mutation status for patients requiring therapy for cancers that have this mutation. For patients with difficult-to-biopsy metastatic tumors, urine-based mutation testing may also provide a viable alternative to gauge mutation status as part of the initial treatment workup. 

&#160; 

In April 2014, we announced the presentation of clinical study results at the American Association for Cancer Research (&#8220;AACR&#8221;) Annual Meeting. Of the 33 patients enrolled in the study, our BRAF V600E oncogene mutation assay was able to identify the mutation in 29 patients (88%) at least one time during the study, demonstrating a high level of concordance with tissue biopsy. 

&#160; 

Longitudinal analysis was performed in 17 patients who had more than one urine-based test during the monitoring period. Of these patients, 13 (76%) showed a correlation between response to treatment and mutational status observed by the urine-based test. The results were presented by Filip Janku, M.D., Ph.D., University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. 

&#160; 

In June 2014, we announced that expanded clinical study results demonstrating the utility of our PCM platform were released at the 50th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (&#8220;ASCO&#8221;). Data from a study in multiple cancer types were published in the 2014 ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings, a Journal of Clinical Oncology by Filip Janku, M.D., Ph.D., University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer. In this study, longitudinal analysis of sequential urine samples demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between changes in the amount of BRAF V600E mutation load and treatment response with targeted drug therapy (p=0.002), per RECIST 1.1 criteria. Results also demonstrated that patients with a decrease in BRAF V600E mutation load had a longer median time to treatment failure compared to those that did not (259 days versus 61 days; p=0.002). Patients in the study had melanoma (n=7), NSCLC (n=3), colorectal cancer (n=2) and other forms of cancer (n=5). Additionally, clinical results from a study in patients with histiocytic disease were presented by Eli Diamond, M.D., Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. In this study, our PCM technology demonstrated 93% concordance for identifying the BRAF V600E mutation and confirmed the absence of the mutation in the six patients whose biopsies tested negative. Our assay also detected the BRAF V600E mutation in two patients for whom tissue biopsy material was inadequate to determine mutational status, and these results were subsequently confirmed with follow-up biopsies. Our PCM platform showed 100% concordance in monitoring response to therapy in six study subjects who tested positive for the mutation and were treated with a BRAF inhibitor. Results from this study were published in the medical journal, Cancer Discovery , and in clinical consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with the histiocytic disease, Erdheim-Chester disease. 

&#160; 

CLIA validated KRAS mutation assay 

&#160; 

In March 2014, our urine based test for KRAS mutations became available to clinicians through our CLIA laboratory. This assay detects and monitors the seven most commonly encountered mutations of the KRAS oncogene and is our first multiplexed oncogene mutation assay utilizing next-generation sequencing as a mutation detection platform. The robustness of 

our ultra-sensitive assays has been demonstrated for the detection of KRAS mutations from cell-free DNA in urine. This mutation commonly occurs in patients diagnosed with either colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, or lung cancer. Of the more than 1.1 million estimated cases of colorectal cancer in the U.S., up to 40% are estimated to harbor KRAS mutations. In pancreatic cancer and lung cancer, approximately 90% and 15% of patients harbor KRAS mutations, respectively. Because of the prevalence of this mutation in several important cancer types, detecting and quantitatively monitoring KRAS mutational status is an area of clinical interest among treating physicians. 

&#160; 

The clinical study being conducted at the USC Norris Cancer Center is focused on mutation monitoring and the emergence of KRAS resistant mutations in colorectal cancer. With multiple targeted therapies for colorectal cancer on the market, detection of KRAS mutations in tissue has a direct impact on the initial treatment selection for these patients. The primary purpose of the collaborative study is to determine whether KRAS mutations can be evaluated in urine to monitor treatment response in patients that test either positive or negative for the mutation. 

&#160; 

The U.S. Oncology clinical study will test detection and monitoring of KRAS mutations in pancreatic cancer patients. In addition to the U.S. Oncology Research-affiliated community cancer care sites participating in this study, additional academic research institutions that specialize in oncology have also elected to participate. CT scans and CA19-9 blood levels are currently the only two methods available to clinicians to monitor metastatic pancreatic cancer tumor burden and response to therapy. However, approximately 11%-17% of patients will not display elevated CA 19-9, even with high tumor load. For patients that test negative for CA19-9, our method to follow disease status by detecting and monitoring KRAS mutations could be distinctly beneficial. 

&#160; 

In November 2015, we presented clinical results at the EORTC-AACR-NCI International Symposium highlighting our ability to detect and quantitate KRAS mutations in blood and urine samples from patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Results showed a highly correlated response. Of the blinded retrospective plasma cell-free DNA samples evaluated, 95% displayed the KRAS mutation concordant with tumor tissue, and for evaluable urine samples in the study, 92% displayed the KRAS mutation concordant with tumor tissue. The majority of patients in the study underwent surgery and received neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy, and serial monitoring of KRAS mutations using our assay showed a clear correlation between blood and urine samples. An estimated analytical limit of detection of two copies per ~100,000 genome equivalents, or 0.002% was observed in the study, demonstrating very high analytical sensitivity. 

CLIA validated EGFR mutation assays 

In the first quarter of 2015, our urine-based tests for the activating mutations, EGFR L858 &#32;and EGFR Exon 19 Deletion , as well as the resistance mutation, EGFR T790M , became available to clinicians through our CLIA laboratory. These assays detect and monitor three critical mutations that are believed to drive the progression of NSCLC. The robustness of our ultra-sensitive assays has been demonstrated for the detection of these three EGFR mutations from cell-free DNA in urine. 

While lung cancer is one of the most aggressive malignancies, progress has been made in the advancement of therapeutic strategies against the disease. In particular, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( EGFR -TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib, in NSCLC patients with activating EGFR &#32;mutations have demonstrated clinical response rates as high as 80%. However, after approximately six to twelve months, most tumors develop acquired resistance to these targeted therapies. Research into such resistance has identified the secondary EGFR &#32; T790M &#32;mutation, which occurs in approximately 60% of patients with acquired resistance to EGFR -TKIs and is reported to negate the benefits of treatment. In November 2015, the first targeted treatment for EGFR T790M &#32;mutation-positive NSCLC, Tagrisso, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;). Additional drug candidates such as rociletinib are in advanced clinical development for this indication. We believe that our non-invasive assays for the detection and monitoring of both activating and resistance EGFR mutations have potential to play an important role in the treatment of NSCLC. 

A clinical study being conducted at UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center (&#8220;UCSD&#8221;) is focused on the determination and monitoring of EGFR T790 resistance mutations in lung cancer patients. With new targeted therapies for EGFR T790M &#32;mutation-positive lung cancer on the market or in late-stage clinical development, detection of this resistance mutation has a direct impact on treatment selection for patients who are progressing on first-line targeted therapy. The primary purpose of this collaborative study is to determine whether EGFR T790M &#32;mutations can be evaluated in urine to monitor treatment response in patients that are found to be positive for the mutation. 

&#32;In April 2015, we presented clinical results at the European Lung Cancer Conference demonstrating that our urine-based PCM platform outperformed tissue biopsy for the detection and monitoring of EGFR T790M &#32;mutations in metastatic lung cancer patients. In an interim analysis of 34 patients from an ongoing clinical study, our PCM platform detected the EGFR T790M &#32;mutation in all patients who were positive for the mutation in tissue biopsy. Our urine-based assay identified additional 

patients as EGFR &#32; T790M -positive, including those who had clinical suspicion of EGFR &#32; T790M -progressive disease, but were either negative by tissue biopsy or had not yet undergone tissue biopsy for confirmation. Based on the study results, our PCM platform detected EGFR T790M &#32;resistance mutations months earlier than radiologic detection of progression in patients. Early pharmacodynamic events occurring within hours or days of anti- EGFR &#32;drug treatment were evaluated in the study by implementing daily monitoring of urinary ctDNA. Initial results demonstrated that immediate changes in EGFR &#32;mutational load using a urine specimen may identify patients who respond to anti- EGFR &#32;therapy much earlier than follow-up CT-scans. 

We have several programs to evaluate the detection and monitoring of EGFR mutational status in lung cancer patients. A focus of these studies is the emergence of the resistant mutation EGFR T790M in lung cancer patients, which can be important for therapeutic selection when this mutation type is or becomes present. In addition to our studies with UCSD, our collaborators for evaluating our technology in NSCLC include Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Clovis Oncology, and Genomac Research Institute. 

Additional mutation assays and clinical programs 

&#160; 

We remain focused on expanding the mutation coverage of our platform to address the relevant clinically actionable driver and resistance mutations in cancers for which the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend targeted therapies, such as lung cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma. &#32; In addition to our assays for the BRAF , KRAS , and EGFR &#32;oncogenes, we are also developing more comprehensive mutation coverage for these other cancers and are adding additional oncogenes with an initial focus on lung cancer, as well as targeting clinically validated gene rearrangements such as ALK, RET, and RO S . The primary objective of our clinical development program is to demonstrate utility for non-invasive, near real-time detection and monitoring of oncogene mutations for any tumor type with our highly sensitive urine- and blood-based platform. Our clinical programs with top-tier cancer centers will continue to drive multiple opportunities for data presentations and publications in peer-reviewed journals. We believe that data from our clinical studies, and those from peer-reviewed manuscripts, once published, will help support our ongoing commercial efforts to build physician demand and health insurance reimbursement for our cancer monitoring platform. 

Infectious Disease 

Following the completion of a pilot clinical study with a urine-based DNA test for high-risk HPV, our first HPV-HR Detection assay became commercially available in March 2013. Initial data from the pilot study showed that our assay provided superior performance to the current leading HPV assay. Our HPV-HR Detection assay showed a sensitivity of 93.0% and specificity of 96.0% for the detection of HPV in a comparative study of 320 high-risk individuals. 

&#160; 

In August 2014, we presented results from two clinical studies at the 29th International Papillomavirus conference for our urine-based diagnostic test for the detection of high risk strains of HPV. Results from both pilot studies consistently demonstrated that our urine-based HPV assay had sensitivity greater than 90% for identifying women with high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2/3). Assay performance was comparable to traditional HPV testing with commercially available tests in patient-matched cervical samples. In one of the studies, urine collection was examined to establish standardization of urine as a clinical specimen for high-risk HPV testing. 

&#160; 

In February 2015, clinical results from the PREDICTORS 4 trial were presented at the European Research Organization on Genital Infection and Neoplasia (EUROGIN) 2015 Congress, which demonstrated high sensitivity for our non-invasive, urine-based HPV assay when determining HPV types and cervical lesions or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) Grade 2/3. Within the PREDICTORS 4 trial, urine and cervical samples were collected from 501 women, and data from this large patient subset demonstrated that sensitivity with our HPV assay for cervical samples was comparable to established cervical screening tests. Sensitivity of our HPV assay using cervical samples was 96.3% for CIN Grade 3+ and 94.5% for CIN Grade 2+. Sensitivity for urine samples was 91.4% for CIN Grade 3+ and 89.0% for CIN Grade 2+. Furthermore, detection of high risk HPV in urine was not different from cervical samples for all age groups of women in the study (18-29 years, 30-39 years and 40-69 years). The study authors concluded that while there is a small loss of sensitivity in urine, the greater than 90% sensitivity for CIN Grade 3+ is still better than conventional Pap cytology, which makes this assay a good candidate in our efforts to increase adoption of HPV testing, especially for women who are not currently being screened for cervical cancer. 

Urine-based HPV testing may offer a significant advantage over the traditional cervical swab sample, which can present a logistic, invasive or privacy concern. A urine-based assay also makes both female and male carrier screening feasible. 

&#160; 

Through licensing agreements, we are pursuing commercialization of our HPV-HR Detection test, particularly in those geographies where compliance with cervical cell sampling is problematic. 

Prenatal Genetics 

&#160; 

The combination of NGS or ddPCR with our proprietary cell-free nucleic acid technology would allow for truly non-invasive prenatal screening of aneuploidies and monogenic disorders. We may pursue the development of our technology for use in prenatal genetics through licensing agreements. 

Transplant 

&#160; 

Patients who receive solid organ or bone marrow transplants are at risk of rejection, particularly during the first few months following surgery. Non-invasive monitoring of transplant status could replace repeated biopsies and blood tests, while keeping both the patient and the physician informed about potential problems. 

Changing the Molecular Diagnostic Paradigm 

&#160; 

Diagnosis and detection of severe and life-threatening diseases are among the most important outcomes of the Human Genome Project (&#8220;HGP&#8221;). There are four requirements to realize the full benefit of the HGP in relation to advances in the war on cancer: (1) large catalogues of cancer mutations, (2) affordable sequencing of patient samples, (3) detection technologies capable of identifying and quantifying rare instances of mutations at affordable prices, and (4) abundant samples that can be collected easily and frequently in order to monitor an individual&#8217;s cancer. 

&#160; 

The first requirement has been met through the Sanger Centre&#8217;s Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database, which has documented more than 233,000 mutations in more than 20,948 genes, and by the National Institutes of Health&#8217;s (&#8220;NIH&#8221;) The Cancer Genome Atlas, which has data on more than 20 cancer types and provides a host of tools for their analysis. The second requirement has been met through the dramatic and continuing decrease in the cost of both conventional sequencing and NGS. NGS and ddPCR, capable of detecting rare mutations among thousands of wild type molecules at a reasonable cost, fulfill the third requirement. 

&#160; 

Our proprietary methods provide the fourth and final requirement, the provision of an abundant systemic sample that allows the purification of cell-free nucleic acids in amounts necessary to detect rare mutations. Furthermore, the &#8220;liquid biopsy&#8221; provided by urine can be collected frequently, is truly non-invasive, and requires no specialized personnel to collect it. 

&#160; 

Taken together, these developments will increase the effectiveness of cancer diagnostics, improve healthcare spending efficiency and overall enable better patient care. These developments have made the era of personalized precision medicine in cancer possible. 

The Market 

&#160; 

The global molecular diagnostics market is forecast to reach nearly $8.0 billion by 2018, a compound annual growth rate (&#8220;CAGR&#8221;) of 9.7%, from 2013-2018. This molecular diagnostics market is segmented on the basis of application, technology, end user, product, and geography. Based on application, the market is further segmented into infectious diseases, oncology, genetics, blood screening, microbiology, and others. Infectious diseases secured the largest market share, whereas oncology was the fastest growing segment amongst the rest. The driving forces of the molecular diagnostics market include the rising incidences of infectious diseases, genetic disorders, and cancer, as well as technological advancements such as assay improvements, new diagnostic tests with novel clinical utility, and portability of equipment. The technology segment of the molecular diagnostics market is comprised of polymerase chain reaction (&#8220;PCR&#8221;), Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification Technology, hybridization, DNA sequencing and NGS, microarray, and others. 

&#160; 

Based on products, the molecular diagnostics market is segmented into instruments, reagents, services and software. Reagents occupy the largest market share and will also register the maximum growth rate in the forecasted period of 2013 to 2018. These reagents include assays that detect and diagnose diseases and are also used as biomarkers that predict the biological properties of potential drug compounds. 

&#160; 

North America accounts for the largest share of the market and is poised to grow at a high rate in the forecast period from 2013 to 2018. The growth can be attributed to the rising incidences of infectious diseases, cancer prevalence, and genetic disorders that are further adding to the overall prevalence of chronic diseases. Europe is the second leading contributor to the molecular diagnostics market. However, the growth of this region is expected to be sluggish in the forecast period and is estimated to grow at a lower CAGR than North America, due to factors such as the uneven reimbursement policies and the European economic crisis. Asia is the most promising region for molecular diagnostics in the coming five years. It is expected 

to grow at a higher CAGR than North America and Europe over the forecast period. The large population base and improved purchasing power of patients are the major drivers of this market. 

&#160; 

Cell-free molecular diagnostics from urine and plasma provide relevant information that can lead to improvements in personalized patient management. Most major pharmaceutical companies have active pharmacogenomic programs included in their clinical studies, anticipating the need to utilize diagnostic testing to stratify patients for clinical response. We believe that our broad intellectual property portfolio positions us to work within these markets, either alone or in partnership with other companies, to develop and market cell-free molecular diagnostic products, all of which we expect would address the large unmet market needs of abundance, simplicity, patient convenience and privacy, accuracy, and cost effectiveness. Such products could play key roles in their applications to improve testing compliance and as such, reduce morbidity and mortality. The use of urine as a sample should provide a paradigm shift in screening and monitoring practices as it provides an easier sample to acquire in a truly non-invasive fashion, with more nucleic acid targets present in the sample leading to greater sensitivity. We believe these modified testing practices will most likely meet with wide physician and patient acceptance in oncology, infectious disease, transplantation, and potentially, prenatal diagnostics. 

Commercial Markets &#8212; Internal Focus 

&#160; 

Oncology 

&#160; 

Cancer mutation testing and monitoring is the priority area for our scientists and commercial personnel. Early data from ongoing clinical studies have shown that cell-free nucleic acid analysis may be useful for determining the presence or absence of actionable mutations, and for monitoring therapeutic response and recurrence in metastatic cancers. Such testing could serve to help physicians monitor ongoing response to therapy or minimal residual disease after surgery, identify signs of early progression, or see markers of resistance emerge prior to clinical presentation. Once therapy is completed, a simple urine test can be used to monitor for early signs of disease recurrence over time. The market for these tests, which is diagnosed cancer patients possessing mutations known to have clinical or therapeutic importance, is already established. Use of urine-based testing could be disruptive and change the pattern of use of other cancer monitoring tools, including imaging technologies, such as PET, CT and MRI scans. 

&#160; 

According to the American Cancer Society&#8217;s (&#8220;ACS&#8221;) 2015 report, there are approximately 565,000 patients that die every year from cancer, not including cancers of the blood, bone marrow or lymphatic system. Using this number as a proxy for metastatic cancers, it can be assumed that all of these patients are being treated within 12 months of death for their disease. Testing and monitoring these patients for response to therapy or progression while on therapy, or for markers of resistance to therapy (like EGFR T790M &#32;for lung cancer), would be a natural extension of our technology. The average lung, breast, or colon cancer patient receives between 18-21 radiographic imaging procedures (PET, CT, MRI, etc.) during the two years following their diagnosis. This averages to approximately nine to ten scans per patient per year. Use of a urine-based monitoring test at the start of therapy, at several points in time during therapy, and at the completion of therapy would represent approximately six to ten separate testing events that could occur within a 12 month period. At a reimbursed price of approximately $1,000 per test, the total available market (&#8220;TAM&#8221;) for treatment response monitoring in the U.S. could be worth between $3.0 billion and $5.0 billion annually. 

&#160; 

Once patients with cancer, primary or metastatic, have completed therapy, they will require monitoring for possible progression and for the appearance of resistance markers, since many metastatic patients may remain on lower-dose &#8220;maintenance therapy&#8221; during the remainder of their lives, or until treatment is no longer considered an option. According to the ACS, as of January 2014, there were nearly 14.5 million patients alive in the U.S. who had been treated for cancers that have metastatic potential. Use of a urine-based mutation monitoring test once a year at $1,000 per test would equate to a TAM for recurrence monitoring in the U.S. of approximately $14.5 billion annually. 

&#160; 

Both of these markets, treatment response and recurrence monitoring, are sizeable economic opportunities. Capturing 10% of the response monitoring market would produce annual revenues of between $300 million and $500 million, and 5% of the recurrence monitoring market would yield annual revenues of over $700 million. 

&#160; 

Beyond cancer patients being actively treated or monitored over time, cell-free nucleic acid testing may eventually emerge as a viable option for pre-cancerous screening. This was recently evaluated in a cancer clinical study at Thomas Jefferson University, funded jointly by the NIH and the National Cancer Institute (&#8220;NCI&#8221;). The study demonstrated that DNA fragments carrying a specific mutation ( KRAS ), and released from pre-cancerous colon polyps, can be detected in the urine of patients. 

&#160; 

Studies have shown that cancer patients who have KRAS &#32;mutations do not respond successfully to treatment with anti- 

EGFR drugs such as Erbitux, Iressa, Tarceva, Tykerb, and Vectibix. 

&#160; 

These anti- EGFR &#32;agents, particularly Erbitux and Vectibix, are a mainstay of treatment for colorectal cancer. It has been estimated that 17%-25% of all human cancers have been found to harbor KRAS &#32;mutations, with mutation rates as high as 59%-90% in pancreatic cancers and 35%-40% in colorectal cancers. These tumors have a low probability of responding to anti- EGFR &#32;drugs. By first testing for KRAS &#32;mutations, physicians will be able to better manage their patients and avoid costly treatments that are unlikely to have a positive clinical response. 

&#160; 

Screening and monitoring for KRAS and other key biomarker mutations (i.e. BRAF , EGFR , NRAS , PIK3CA , etc.) using urine-based tests would provide a simple, non-invasive, cost effective, and convenient testing alternative for physicians and patients. Urine samples may even be collected in the patient&#8217;s home as required, or as requested by the physician. 

&#160; 

Simple urine-based assays would likely lead to improved personalized medicine for patients, resulting in the right drug being prescribed for the right disease at the right time. We believe this technology will lead to an improved quality of life for patients and will become part of a new standard of care for those patients and physicians fighting the war on cancer. 

Drug Development and Monitoring of Therapeutic Outcomes 

&#160; 

Cell-free DNA diagnostic technology has significant potential as a simple, quick, non-invasive way of monitoring clinical responses to drugs in clinical development and evaluating patient-specific responses to already approved and marketed therapies. Specific target applications include, but are not limited to, the detection of metastasis following tumor surgery, monitoring of response and tumor progression during chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or radiation therapy, development of optimal hormonal and chemotherapeutic treatment protocols, and monitoring of transplantation patients on immunosuppressive drugs. 

&#160; 

With cancer treatment today, it is often difficult to determine if a particular patient is responding to their current therapeutic regimen. Generally, patients are re-examined periodically to determine if a tumor has grown in size, reduced in size (i.e., partial response), disappeared (i.e. no sign of disease - complete response) or remained the same (stable disease). If the tumor has grown in size or remained the same, treatment may be adjusted. By measuring and monitoring tumor specific genetic markers in a patient&#8217;s urine pre-, peri- and post-chemotherapy, it may be possible to more quickly determine whether a patient is responding to therapy. Use of cell-free DNA diagnostics may permit more rapid and real-time therapeutic decisions on a patient-specific basis. Approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases are diagnosed annually, and there are several hundred companies developing therapeutic agents in the U.S. alone. We believe this indicates a large potential application to use cell-free DNA diagnostic technology for both drug development and the monitoring of therapeutic outcomes. 

&#160; 

One of the largest costs associated with development of a new therapy is the size of human clinical studies required to identify the cohort of responders, and the resulting statistical power required. By measuring specific genetic markers, it may be possible to pre-identify, and subsequently screen, for the most likely responders to the therapy, and to limit patient recruitment to this subset. This strategy could significantly reduce the cost to develop a drug and improve development timelines. We believe that there is a significant commercial potential for our urine-based cell-free molecular diagnostic technology to be incorporated into these clinical trial protocols, and ultimately into post-approval patient identification protocol. 

Commercial Markets &#8212; External Focus 

&#160; 

We will seek to license and/or partner with other companies who have vested interests or commercial strengths in the following areas in order to develop applicable diagnostic and/or monitoring tests using our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology. 

&#160; 

Infectious Diseases &#32;&#8212; HPV 

&#160; 

The rationale for screening for HPV is that high-risk subtypes cause virtually all cases of cervical cancer. We have developed a urine-based HPV test capable of screening for known high-risk HPV types that are associated with the development of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer, and the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in females, worldwide. Deaths due to cervical cancer are a significant global problem, especially in developing countries where screening practices are inadequate. 

&#160; 

According to the ACS, India alone accounts for 27% (77,100) of total worldwide cervical cancer deaths. A recent clinical trial conducted in rural India found that a single round of HPV DNA testing was associated with an approximately 50% reduction in the risk of developing advanced cervical cancer and associated deaths. In the U.S., better patient compliance and 

screening guidelines reduced cervical cancer death rates to only 4,290 cases in 2011. The major drivers of poor screening in these developing regions are cultural acceptance, limited screening resources and funding, and poor cytology proficiency. Further exacerbating the compliance hurdles is that the primary screening mechanism involves an invasive cervical scraping procedure (e.g., Pap smear). It is generally agreed that the early detection of cervical cancer leads to much higher recovery rates and lower rates of invasive disease. 

There is a tremendous unmet need for a new non-invasive, simple, private, and cost effective test to simplify the HPV screening process for patients and, in turn, improve compliance. We believe our urine-based HPV test has the potential to address these market needs. 

&#160; 

Other areas beyond HPV detection and monitoring include those infectious diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Cell-free nucleic acid assays that detect molecular targets in organisms can provide a quick, accurate, simple, and cost effective method for screening and monitoring disease. Specific areas of interest include testing for molecular targets from organisms that cause Lyme disease, John Cunningham Virus, valley fever, and various fungal infections. These organisms all tend to be difficult to identify with current technology, making differential diagnosis especially challenging, thus delaying the start of potentially curative anti-infective treatment. 

&#160; 

Transplantation 

&#160; 

According to government statistics, there are approximately 28,000 solid organ transplants performed in the U.S. annually. Post-transplant monitoring for organ rejection episodes requires a highly invasive tissue biopsy. Approximately ten such biopsies are taken over a period of one year per patient. Because organ rejection is marked by the early death of cells, we believe that an early indication of rejection can be identified by measuring a unique series of genetic markers characteristic of the organ donor that can be easily detected in random urine specimens from the transplant recipient. Providing early evidence of tissue rejection is key to the administration and monitoring of immunosuppressive therapies used to prevent rejection. Given the annual number of transplants performed in the U.S. and the annual number of corresponding biopsies performed per patient, this would equate to a market opportunity in the U.S. of roughly 300,000 urine-based tests per year. Transplantation monitoring with our technology offers opportunities for partnering with companies developing drugs for controlling tissue rejection, developing cell transplantation, or developing novel transplantation technologies. This illustrates the breadth of commercial potential of our cell-free molecular testing platform technology, and we intend to leverage such potential applications to maximize stockholder value. 

&#160; 

Technologies for the collection, shipment and storage of urine specimens, and cell-free nucleic acid extraction 

&#160; 

Successful implementation of our cell-free nucleic acid technology in molecular testing is tightly linked to the availability of techniques and procedures for cell-free nucleic acid preservation, purification, and analysis. Our strategic plan includes the allocation of sufficient resources for the creation of robust, feasible, and inexpensive approaches to improve the efficiency of working with urine samples. 

We intend to invest in the research and development of new nucleic acid preservatives or methods, which improve the stability of urine as a cell-free nucleic acid specimen. We will also explore the feasibility of automating cell-free nucleic acid extraction from urine in collaboration with industry leaders in robotics, liquid handling, and other applicable technologies. Upon the completion of such projects, it is our expectation that a simple and streamlined method can be &#8220;kitted&#8221; as a stand-alone product to provide academic researchers with reagents that they can purchase and utilize in their own laboratories. 

This program serves three primary purposes: it will (1) accelerate the rate of publications and development of the body of evidence supporting urine as a viable specimen and, therefore, market acceptance of urine-based nucleic acid testing, (2) create an RUO product for direct sale, and (3) provide a foundation for our technology transfer programs to partner reference laboratories seeking to bring cell-free nucleic acid testing technology in-house. 

&#160; 

Expansion of Analytically Validated Instrumentation, Systems, and Platforms 

&#160; 

A unique element of our cell-free nucleic acid testing method is its design, which is focused on &#8220;counting&#8221; the target molecules already enriched through our initial proprietary specimen collection, isolation, and amplification procedures. This molecular counting is currently achieved in our Clinical Services Laboratory by using Illumina MiSeq systems as the detection platform; however, this molecular counting is not limited to just this type of system. Alternative NGS systems, Mass Spectrometry-based systems, ddPCR, or MicroArray reading systems may also be used in conjunction with our front-end sample preparation technology. As we expand our menu of targeted biomarker tests, we will also broaden the available platforms that can be used as detectors. When coupled with the RUO kitting program referenced above, the benefit of multiple 

analytically validated detection systems will increase the addressable market for our technology transfer program and future commercial partnerships. 

Our Business Strategy 

&#160; 

We plan to leverage our cell-free nucleic acid technology to develop and market, either independently or in conjunction with corporate partners, molecular diagnostic products in our core market, oncology, as well as other markets including infectious disease, transplantation, and prenatal diagnostics. Our marketing strategy includes approaches across multiple fronts. In the U.S. market, we have acquired a CLIA laboratory. At the late stages of development for each product, while collecting clinical data for regulatory submissions, we intend to market the products as LDTs through our CLIA laboratory. CLIA laboratories can develop and offer their own in-house tests that receive reimbursement under the provisions of LDT rules. 

&#160; 

The U.S. Congress passed the CLIA in 1988 to regulate development, evaluation, and use of LDTs. The CLIA states that laboratories must demonstrate how well an LDT performs using certain performance standards. Laboratories that perform testing on human specimens for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease, or for the assessment of health, must comply with all applicable CLIA regulations. These regulations, which were finalized in 2003, establish standards to help ensure the quality and accuracy of laboratory testing. While most common laboratory tests are commercial tests, manufactured and marketed to multiple laboratories, some new tests are developed, evaluated, and validated within one particular laboratory. These LDTs are used solely within that laboratory and are not distributed or sold to any other laboratories or health care facilities. 

&#160; 

Because LDTs are not marketed to other laboratories or facilities, they do not require approval for marketing from the FDA as do commercially developed and marketed tests. However, these types of tests must go through rigorous validation procedures and must meet several criteria before results can be used for decisions regarding patient care. These include demonstration of test accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity. 

&#160; 

We may pursue FDA review and approval for our products as clinical studies are completed. Assuming we receive FDA clearance or approval for our products, we plan to market such urine-based test kits through a U.S. commercial organization directly to national and regional CLIA medical testing laboratories. We also intend to complete business partnerships (out-license agreements) with diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies in the U.S., Europe, Asia Pacific and the rest of the world as appropriate given market conditions and opportunities. This strategy would provide both short term (license fees) and long term (royalty) revenue streams. Licensees of our technology will use our platform technology in the clinical development of their products, to monitor patients taking their marketed products (i.e., TNF inhibitors) and in certain situations to develop, market and sell our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology in predefined fields of use and geographic territories. We plan to become a fully vertically integrated business in which we develop, manufacture, register, market, and sell our products. 

&#160; 

The major advantages of our cell-free nucleic acids tests, when commercially available, will be the ease of sample collection, anticipated higher levels of sensitivity and specificity, larger quantities of genetic material for analysis (allowing for the detection of oncogene mutations that are low in abundance), patient convenience, non-invasiveness, and the ability to provide more efficient and effective monitoring protocols. Our cell-free nucleic molecular diagnostic technology must be cost effective, and we believe the process to make, sell, and process our assays is relatively simple and suitable for automation. 

&#160; 

During the last decade, medical laboratory operating margins have declined in the face of Medicare fee schedule reductions, managed care contracts, competitive bidding, and other cost containment measures. Our technology is commercially available and reimbursement is available under the current procedural terminology (&#8220;CPT&#8221;) codes for molecular-based testing. We are marketing our tests directly to physicians, and we process those tests through our CLIA laboratory. We are working with public and private payors for appropriate reimbursement of processed tests. We believe this strategy, coupled with strong clinical results supporting the use of our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology, will lead to broad market adoption of our technology. 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 41 dedicated scientists located in our office in San Diego, California. We plan to continue to grow our research and development organization as needed to support our product development goals and expect that our research and development team will represent a good mix of senior lead researchers and scientists (Ph.Ds.), laboratory associate scientists, and experts in clinical development and regulatory affairs of molecular diagnostics. We plan to rapidly introduce new products to the market that can be used as LDTs within our CLIA lab, and simultaneously continue funding and 

collaborating on the necessary clinical studies that can support the utility of our tests, and potentially support regulatory submissions for marketing approval or clearance of our tests depending upon the nature of the product. We currently have sufficient resources to complete these projects extending into 2017. We plan to seek additional funding as required to supplement current commercial and licensing revenue. Information and documentation systems infrastructure (e.g., design history files and firewalls) must be in place to support the confidentiality of multiple partnering programs and the rigorous scientific and regulatory oversight needed for products in the in-vitro diagnostics markets. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;were approximately $10.6 million , $6.7 million &#32;and $3.9 million , respectively. 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We consider the protection of our proprietary technologies and products to be a critical element in the success of our business. As of December 31, 2015 , our wholly-owned and licensed intellectual property included over 85 issued patents and over 60 pending patent applications in the U.S. and abroad. The pending applications include multiple international applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (&#8220;PCT applications&#8221;) that will be used as the basis for multiple additional patent applications. 

One group of patents and patent applications includes seven U.S. patents, with 30 counterpart patents in Japan, Hong Kong and Europe, including the major markets of the European countries. These patents are directed to the detection of nucleic acid sequences in urine and nucleic acid modifications and alterations in urine. This patent family includes claims directed to prenatal analysis of fetal DNA, the determination of the sex of a fetus and the detection of diseases such as Down Syndrome caused by genetic alterations. Other patented claims are directed to detecting and monitoring cancer through urine-based testing, nucleic acid screening, and monitoring in cases of transplantation and infectious diseases, including infection by viruses and pathogens, and other potential diagnostic and genetic testing applications. Members of this patent group expire between 2018 and 2026. Additional pending claims are directed to the preparation of cell-free nucleic acids, as well as detection of short cell-free nucleic acid molecules which, if granted, will expire between 2028 and 2033. 

&#160; 

A second group is directed to the detection of specific gene mutations and indicators of disease. These include NPM1 &#32;mutations, BRAF &#32;mutations, SF3B1 &#32;mutations, HPV, AML, and hairy cell leukemia. The detection includes analysis of cell-free nucleic acid molecules. This group includes U.S. patent numbers 8,222,370 B1, 8,501,924 B1, 8,642,261 B1, and 9,222,137 B1 as well as seven pending U.S. patent applications. There are also 25 pending non-U.S. and PCT patent applications. Members of this patent group expire between 2025 and 2034. 

&#160; 

A third group is directed to our molecular detection platform utilizing proprietary probe chemistry on optical detectors such as CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductors). This platform technology utilizes a conjugated probe and optical detection of analytes in medical diagnostics. This group includes one issued patent in Japan and patents in the major markets of Europe, with pending applications in the U.S., Europe, and Hong Kong. Members of this patent group expire beginning in 2022. 

&#160; 

Applications are also pending that are directed to detecting and enriching small concentrations of short nucleic acid sequences, detecting and monitoring mutations in histiocytosis, and detecting and monitoring mutations in diseases, such as cancer, over time. 

&#160; 

Wherever possible, we seek to protect our inventions by filing U.S. patents as well as foreign counterpart applications in select other countries. Because patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy for at least eighteen months after the applications are filed, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for protection of inventions set forth in such patent applications. Our planned or potential products may be covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, in which case continued development and marketing of our products would require a license. Required licenses may not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If we do not obtain these licenses, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to design around the patents, or we could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses are not possible. 

&#160; 

We may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, which are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, certain consultants, and contractors. These agreements may be breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees or our consultants 

or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 

Manufacturing and Distribution 

&#160; 

In 2016, we plan to continue introducing our LDTs into the marketplace through our CLIA licensed and CAP accredited laboratory. We source all reagents and consumables needed for our LDTs from third party vendors, and we currently do not manufacture reagents kits for use in our own laboratory, or to distribute to third party laboratories. 

&#160; 

We have established a sales and marketing organization to directly market our LDTs for oncogene mutations to end users in the oncology market segment. As of December 31, 2015 , we had 16 employees dedicated to the sales and marketing of our LDTs in the U.S. market. We intend to add additional employees as needed to support the introduction of new LDTs planned for 2016. 

Reimbursement 

&#160; 

Medicare and other third-party payors will independently evaluate our technologies by, among other things, a cost/benefit analysis, assessing other available options and reviewing the published literature with respect to the results obtained from our clinical studies. Currently, CPT codes are available for molecular testing, which we believe will allow our technologies to be billed following completion of a test that has been prescribed by a physician for a patient. We believe that the existence of current CPT codes with applicability to our tests will help facilitate Medicare&#8217;s reimbursement process, as well as that for third party insurance providers. 

&#160; 

Reimbursement of our novel tests is a top priority, as physician and patient access to our technology is essential for widespread adoption of our products. To gain initial reimbursement, our qualitative tests will be billed and reimbursed under established Tier I codes for their respective mutation (i.e., BRAF, KRAS, and EGFR). These are CPT codes from the American Medical Association (MoPath system), which should enable us to bill and obtain reimbursement for our tests without delay. As we develop our tests and demonstrate novel clinical utility in cancer monitoring, supported by our high analytical sensitivity, quantitative performance over a large dynamic range, and clinical experience, we will pursue a Not Otherwise Classified (&#8220;NOC&#8221;) code for billing and reimbursement. Under these conditions, premium pricing is expected. Over time, we intend to pursue permanent CPT codes unique to our cancer monitoring diagnostics once sufficient value is assigned under the NOC code system. We will engage with third party payors including integrated healthcare networks and Medicare, for reimbursement of our tests, with the goals of obtaining strong adoption of our tests, positive coverage decisions and appropriate valuation of our tests on a widespread basis over time. In 2016, we plan to continue developing clinical evidence around the utility and performance of our testing platform and interacting with payors for the reimbursement of our commercially available urine-based cell-free nucleic acid diagnostics. 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries will be a significant factor in the development, production and marketing of any products that we may develop. The nature and extent to which such regulation may apply will vary depending on the nature of any such products and the policy of each country. Virtually all of our potential products will require regulatory allowance or approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization, except for our LDTs. We may submit and obtain FDA approval or clearance for some or all of our diagnostic products. Pursuing and receiving FDA approval or clearance may be vital to maximizing our customer base and revenue potential for our numerous products. 

&#160; 

FDA clearance for our products may be obtained through submission of a 510(k) statement of equivalency. Another regulatory option, albeit more complicated and expensive, is to pursue FDA approval by submitting a Pre-Market Approval (&#8220;PMA&#8221;) application. A 510(k) submission requires that we show equivalency of results in a clinical study with parallel comparison against an existing and FDA-recognized reference method (predicate device). 

&#160; 

The FDA also regulates the sale of certain reagents, including our potential reagents, used by laboratories under the LDT rules to perform tests. The FDA refers to such reagents as Analyte-Specific Reagents (&#8220;ASRs&#8221;). ASR&#8217;s generally do not require FDA pre-market approval or clearance if they are (1) sold to clinical laboratories certified under the CLIA to perform high complexity testing and (2) are labeled in accordance with FDA requirements, including a statement that their analytical and performance characteristics have not been established. Prior to, or in lieu of, FDA approval, we can sell our reagents to laboratories that meet the established criteria. The FDA also regulates all promotional materials and specifically prohibits medical and efficacy claims. 

&#160; 

Assuming that FDA approval or clearance is received for our products, a number of other FDA requirements would apply to our manufacturing and distribution efforts. Medical device manufacturers must be registered and their products listed with the FDA, and certain adverse events, such as reagent failures, significant changes in quality control and other events requiring correction and/or replacement or removal of reagents must be documented and reported to the FDA. The FDA also regulates product labeling, promotion and, in some cases, advertising, of medical devices. As discussed above, we must comply with the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation that establishes extensive requirements for design control, quality control, validation, and manufacturing. Thus, even with FDA approval or clearance, we must continue to be diligent in maintaining compliance with these various regulations, as failure to do so can lead to enforcement action. The FDA periodically inspects facilities to determine compliance with these and other requirements. 

Competition 

&#160; 

The medical diagnostic industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include medical diagnostic companies, many of which have financial, technical, and marketing resources significantly greater than our resources. In addition, there are a significant number of biotechnology companies working on evolving technologies that may supplant our technology or make it obsolete. Academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or through joint ventures. We are aware of certain development projects for products to prevent or treat certain diseases targeted by us. The existence of these potential products or other products or treatments of which we are not aware, or products or treatments that may be developed in the future, may adversely affect the marketability of our products or product candidates. 

&#160; 

We believe that direct competition in the area of cell-free DNA detection and analysis is precluded by our growing patent estate. However, there are other companies working in the area of cell-free nucleic acids and circulating tumor cell (&#8220;CTC&#8221;) collection and analysis in blood plasma that could compete in similar clinical areas, including disease detection, therapeutic response monitoring and minimal disease detection. These companies include Johnson &#38; Johnson (Veridex), Illumina, Inc., Genomic Health, Inc., Sequenom, Inc., Cepheid, Qiagen N.V., Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, LabCorp, Biocept, Inc., Exact Sciences Corporation, Boreal Genomics Inc., Sysmex-Inostics GmbH and numerous other smaller companies, both in the research and development and early commercial development phases. However, we believe that the advantages of urine as a specimen (large amounts of cell-free nucleic acid material, ease of collection, continuous collection over time and virtually no limit on sample size and frequency) position us favorably even among such competing companies. 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of February 29, 2016 &#32;we had a total of 72 employees, all of whom were full-time.
