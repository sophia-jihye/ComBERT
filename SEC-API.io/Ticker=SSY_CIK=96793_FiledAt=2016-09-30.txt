History 

We are an Ohio corporation incorporated in June 1959. In 2001, we redirected our business strategy toward healthcare services in the United States. On February 1, 2001, we purchased five community hospitals, leasehold rights for a sixth hospital and the related businesses of all six hospitals. We subsequently have acquired two hospitals and sold four hospitals and three home health businesses. We also sold the operations of one hospital to a buyer who leased the hospital building from us but which subsequently ceased its hospital operations. In 2008, a wholly-owned subsidiary acquired Carmichael&#146;s Cashway Pharmacy, Inc. (&#147;Carmichael&#148;) which provides retail and institutional pharmacy services to various communities in southwest Louisiana and eastern Texas. 

Business Strategy: Operations, Dispositions and Acquisitions 

The business strategy of SunLink is to focus its efforts on improving internal operations of the existing pharmacy business and healthcare facilities subsidiaries and on the sale or disposition of its subsidiaries&#146; underperforming assets. The Company considers the disposition of facilities and operations based on a variety of factors in addition to under-performance, including asset values, return on investments and competition from existing and potential competitors, capital improvement needs, prevailing reimbursement rates for drugs and medical services under various Federal and state programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid) and by private payors, corporate strategy and other corporate objectives. The Company also is considering, subject to available funds, potential healthcare facility upgrades and improvements. 

On August 19, 2016, a subsidiary of the Company sold substantially all assets and certain liabilities of its Chestatee Regional Hospital in Dahlonega, GA (&#147;Dahlonega&#148;), for approximately $15,000 subject to adjustment for the book value of certain assets and liabilities at the sale date. In addition, the Company has entered into an agreement to lease the emergency department and certain ancillary space in its former hospital, 

&#160;

North Georgia Medical Center, which is now closed, to a regional healthcare system. The lease transaction is subject to a number of conditions precedent including regulatory approval and negotiation of definitive leases. The Company continues to operate its 100-bed skilled nursing facility which is located adjacent to such hospital. The Company believes its specialty pharmacy business continues to under-perform, and the Company has engaged advisors to assist it in evaluating the possible sale of its specialty pharmacy business and one medical office building. The Company&#146;s recent or possible uses of net proceeds from the Dahlonega sale and other possible transactions include or may include, among other things, a prepayment of long-term debt, a return of capital to shareholders via a repurchase of shares or a dividend, improvements to existing facilities, and other general corporate purposes. However, there can be no assurance any further sale or lease transaction will be authorized by the Board of Directors or completed or, if completed, that there will be sufficient proceeds to repay the Company&#146;s long-term debt, or return capital to shareholders or for future development or general corporate purposes. 

Healthcare Facilities Operations 

SunLink&#146;s Healthcare Facilities Segment includes: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Trace Regional Hospital (&#147;Trace&#148;), owned and operated by a subsidiary, located in Houston, Chickasaw County, Mississippi, consists of a JCAHO accredited 84-licensed-bed, acute care hospital, which includes an 18-bed geriatric psychiatric unit (&#147;GPU&#148;), Trace is the only hospital in Chickasaw County. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Floy Dyer Manor Nursing Home, a 66-bed nursing home, owned by the same subsidiary as, and located adjacent to, Trace. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Gilmer Nursing Home (&#147;Gilmer&#148;), owned and operated by a subsidiary, located in Ellijay, Gilmer County, Georgia, which operates a 100-bed nursing facility. This subsidiary also owns a hospital building and has agreed to lease the portion of that building occupied by the former emergency department to an unaffiliated healthcare provider. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Two separate subsidiaries which own medical buildings, in Dahlonega and Ellijay, Georgia, respectively, which are leased to unaffiliated healthcare providers. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A subsidiary which owns the Careside Medical Park (&#147;Careside&#148;) located in Clanton, Chilton County, Alabama. Careside includes a closed hospital and medical office building in which it currently rents office space to one unaffiliated healthcare provider. Hospital Operations 

Utilization of Local Hospital Management Team 

We believe that the potential of the Trace Hospital is dependent on its ability to offer appropriate healthcare services and effectively recruit and retain employees and physicians. The hospital has developed and continuously seeks to implement an operating plan designed to improve efficiency and increase revenue including, but not limited to, the expansion of services offered by the hospital and the recruitment of physicians to the community. 

The Trace Hospital management team is comprised of a chief executive officer, chief financial officer and chief nursing officer. The quality of the on-site hospital management team is critical to the success of the hospital. The on-site management team is responsible for implementing the operating plan under the guidance of the board of directors of the subsidiary which owns and operates Trace. The Trace Hospital management team participates in a performance-based compensation program based upon the achievement of operational, clinical and financial goals set forth in the operating plan. 

The Trace Hospital management team is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the hospital and has access to support services, assistance, and advice in certain areas, including strategic planning and physician 

&#160;

recruiting, supplies and equipment purchasing, corporate compliance, reimbursement, information systems, human resources, accounting, cash management, capital financing, tax and insurance, some of which may be provided by SunLink or other SunLink subsidiaries. Financial controls are maintained through the utilization of policies and procedures and monitoring by the subsidiary board of directors. 

Expansion of Services and Facilities 

The subsidiary which owns and operates Trace Hospital seeks to add services on an as-needed basis in order to improve access to quality healthcare services in the communities it serves, with the ultimate goal of reducing the out-migration of patients to other hospitals or alternate service providers. Additional and expanded services and programs, which may include specialty inpatient and outpatient services, are often dependent on recruiting physicians and other healthcare professionals; therefore recruiting goals are important to the hospital&#146;s ability to expand services. Capital investments in technology and facilities are often necessary to increase the quality and scope of services provided to the communities and to add to the Trace Hospital&#146;s reputation in the community, reducing out-migration and increasing patient referrals and revenue. The hospital endeavors to provide a quality, urgent care clinic or rural health clinic as a critical component of its local service offering and which is intended to function as each facility&#146;s &#147;window to the community&#148;. 

Medical Staff 

The number and quality of physicians affiliated with a hospital directly affect the quality and availability of patient care and the reputation of the hospital. Physicians generally may terminate their affiliation with a hospital at any time. Our Trace Hospital seeks to retain primary care physicians of varied specialties on its medical staff to attract other qualified physicians. Physicians generally refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the perceived quality of services the hospital renders to patients and physicians; the quality of other physicians on the medical staff; the location of the hospital; and the quality of the hospital&#146;s facilities, equipment and employees. Accordingly, Trace Hospital strives to provide suitable facilities, equipment, employees and services for physicians and their patients. 

Recruiting Physicians and Healthcare Professionals 

The Trace Hospital management team is responsible for assessing the need for additional physicians and other healthcare professionals including the number and specialty of additional physicians needed by the hospital&#146;s community. The local hospital management team, with the assistance of outside recruiting firms, identifies and seeks to attract specific physicians to the hospital&#146;s medical staff and other hospital professionals to work under the direction of staff physicians. Our Trace Hospital has employed physicians to better align physician performance with hospital goals through employment relationships. Many hospitals and hospital systems are attempting to improve clinical and financial results by employing physicians. For newly recruited non-employed physicians, the hospital may guarantee such physicians a minimum level of gross receipts during an initial period, generally one year, and assist the physician&#146;s transition into the community. The physician is required to repay some or all of the amounts paid under such guarantee if the physician leaves the community within a specified period. The hospital periodically evaluates each physician and may terminate employment based on performance and the needs of each facility. Physician recruiting has become more challenging, and will continue to remain challenging due to various factors including healthcare reform and market forces, including competition for physicians. The costs of recruiting and retaining physicians are also expected to increase as more physicians are employed and salaries and support costs continue to increase. 

Quality Assurance 

The Trace Hospital implements quality assurance procedures to monitor the level and quality of care provided to its patients. Each hospital has a medical director who supervises and is responsible for the quality of medical care provided and a medical advisory committee comprised of physicians who review the professional 

&#160;

credentials of physicians applying for medical staff privileges at the hospital. The medical advisory committee also reviews the quality of the logistical, medical and technological support provided to the physicians. Trace Hospital periodically conducts surveys of its patients, either during their stay at the hospital or subsequently, to identify potential areas of improvement. Trace Hospital is accredited by the JCAHO. 

Operating Statistics 

The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for SunLink&#146;s healthcare facility subsidiaries included in continuing operations as of June 30 for the periods indicated.

(1) Equivalent admissions are a statistic used by management (and certain investors) as a general approximation of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. Equivalent admissions are computed by multiplying admissions (inpatient volume) by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and gross outpatient revenues and dividing the result by gross inpatient revenues. The equivalent admissions computation is intended to relate outpatient revenues to the volume measure (admissions) used to measure inpatient volume resulting in a general approximation of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. (2) Average length of stay is calculated based on the number of patient days divided by the number of admissions. (3) Adjusted patient days have been calculated based on a revenue-based formula of multiplying actual patient days by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and gross outpatient revenues and dividing the result by gross inpatient revenues for each subsidiary hospital. Adjusted patient days is a statistic (which is used generally in the industry) designed to communicate an approximate volume of service provided to inpatients and outpatients by converting total patient revenues to a number representing adjusted patient days. (4) Percentages are calculated by dividing average daily census by the average number of licensed hospital beds. (5) Percentages are calculated by dividing average daily census by the average number of hospital beds in service. &#160;

Healthcare Facilities Revenue Sources Allocation 

Sources of Revenue 

Our Trace Hospital and our nursing homes receive payments for patient care from Federal Medicare programs, State Medicaid programs, private insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, TriCare, and from employers and patients directly. Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is a federal-state program, administered by the states, that provides hospital and nursing home benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care. Trace Hospital is certified as a healthcare services provider for persons covered by Medicare and Medicaid programs. TriCare is a federal program for the healthcare of certain U.S. military personnel and their dependants. See &#147;Item 7 Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148;. 

The following table sets forth the percentage of patient days from various payors in SunLink&#146;s healthcare facilities for the periods indicated.

&#160; Sources of Revenue 

Our Trace Hospital and our nursing centers receive payments for patient care from Federal Medicare programs, State Medicaid programs, private insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, TriCare, and from employers and patients directly. Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is a federal-state program, administered by the states, that provides hospital and nursing home benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care. Trace Hospital and our nursing centers are certified as healthcare services providers for persons covered by Medicare and Medicaid programs. TriCare is a federal program for the healthcare of certain U.S. military personnel and their dependants. See &#147;Item 7 Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148;. 

Hospital patients generally are not responsible for any difference between established hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid and some private insurer plans, health maintenance organization (&#147;HMO&#148;) plans and preferred provider organizations (&#147;PPO&#148;) plans, but are 

&#160;

responsible to the extent of any exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance has been increasing in recent years. Collection of amounts due from individuals typically is more difficult than from governmental or third-party payors. Further, amounts received under the Medicare and Medicaid programs generally are significantly less than the established charges of most hospitals, including our own, for the services provided. Likewise, HMOs and PPOs generally seek and obtain discounts from the established charges of most hospitals. See &#147;Item 1. Business&#151;Government Reimbursement Programs&#151;Hospitals&#151;Medicare/Medicaid Reimbursement&#148;. 

Nursing Center Operations 

Our nursing centers consist of two skilled nursing facilities (collectively &#147;nursing centers&#148;) and form part of our healthcare facilities segment. 

Utilization of Local Nursing Center Management Team 

Each of our nursing centers is managed by a state-licensed executive director who is supported by other professional personnel, including, but not limited to, a director of nursing, nursing assistants, licensed practical nurses, staff development coordinator, activities director, social services director, clinical liaisons, admissions coordinator, and business office manager. The directors of nursing are state-licensed nurses who supervise our nursing staffs that include, but are not limited to, registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and nursing assistants. Staff size and composition vary depending on the size and occupancy of each nursing center, the types of services provided and the acuity level of the patients and residents. The nursing centers contract with physicians who provide medical director services and serve on performance improvement committees. We provide our nursing center subsidiaries with centralized administrative services in the areas of information systems, clinical operations, regulatory guidance, reimbursement guidance, state licensing, and Medicare and Medicaid certification, and maintenance support, as well as legal, finance, accounting, purchasing, human resources management, and facilities management support. The centralization of these services improves operating efficiencies, promotes the standardization of certain processes and permits the healthcare staff to of our nursing centers to focus on the delivery of quality care. 

Quality Assurance 

Quality of care is monitored and enhanced by our clinical operations personnel, as well as family satisfaction surveys. The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (the &#147;IMPACT Act&#148;), passed on October 6, 2014, requires standardized assessment data for quality improvement, payment, and discharge planning purposes across the spectrum of post acute-care providers (&#147;PACs&#148;), including skilled nursing facilities. 

Sources of Revenue 

Nursing center revenues are derived principally from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private and other payors. Consistent with the nursing centers industry, changes in the mix of the patient and resident population among these categories could significantly affect the profitability of our nursing centers operations. A substantial portion of our nursing centers&#146; revenues are derived from patients covered by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We could be adversely affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and private third-party payors to contain healthcare costs. We cannot assure you that reimbursement payments under governmental and private third-party payor programs, including Medicare supplemental insurance policies, will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to these programs. Medicare reimbursement in nursing centers is subject to fixed payments under the Medicare prospective payment systems. In accordance with Medicare laws, CMS makes annual adjustments to Medicare payment rates in many prospective payment systems under what is commonly known as a &#147;market basket update.&#148; Each year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (&#147;Med PAC&#148;), a 

&#160;

commission chartered by Congress to advise it on Medicare payment issues, makes payment policy recommendations to Congress for a variety of Medicare payment systems. Congress is not obligated to adopt Med PAC recommendations, and, based upon outcomes in previous years, there can be no assurance that Congress will adopt Med Pac&#146;s recommendations in a given year. Medicaid reimbursement rates in many states in which we operate nursing centers also are based upon fixed payment systems. Generally, these rates are adjusted annually for inflation. However, these adjustments may not reflect the actual increase in the costs of providing healthcare services. In addition, Medicaid reimbursement can be impacted negatively by state budgetary pressures, which may lead to reduced reimbursement or delays in receiving payments. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the nursing centers operated by us, or the provision of goods and services offered by us, will meet the requirements for participation in such programs. 

Healthcare Facilities Competition 

Among the factors which we believe influence patient selection among our healthcare in our subsidiary hospital and nursing center markets are: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The appearance and functionality of the healthcare facilities; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The quality and demeanor of professional staff and physicians; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The participation of the facility in plans which pays all or a portion of the patient&#146;s bill. Such factors are influenced heavily by the quality and scope of medical services, strength of hospital referral networks, location and the price of services. 

Trace Hospital may face less competition in its immediate patient service area than would be expected in larger communities because it is the primary provider of hospital services in its community. Our Trace hospital faces competition from larger tertiary care centers and, in most cases, other rural, exurban, suburban or, in limited circumstances, urban hospitals, some of which offer more specialized services. The competing hospitals may be owned by governmental agencies or not-for-profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions and may be able to finance capital expenditures on a tax-exempt basis. Such governmental-owned and not-for-profit hospitals, as well as various for-profit hospitals operating in the broader service area of our subsidiary hospital, likely have greater access to financial resources than does our subsidiary hospital. 

Our nursing centers compete with other nursing centers and similar long-term care facilities primarily on the basis of quality of care, reputation, location, and physical appearance and, in the case of private payment residents, the charges for our services. Our nursing centers also compete on a local and regional basis with other facilities providing similar services, including hospitals, extended care centers, assisted living facilities, home health agencies, and similar institutions. Some competitors may operate newer facilities and may provide services, including skilled nursing services that we may not offer at our nursing centers. Our competitors include government-owned, religious organization-owned, secular nonprofit and for-profit institutions. Many of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. Although there is limited, if any, price competition with respect to Medicare and Medicaid residents (since revenues received for services provided to these residents are generally based on pre-established rates), there is substantial price competition for private payment residents. Historically our nursing centers have been located adjacent to acute care hospitals owned and operated by one of our subsidiaries. Currently, however, one of our two nursing centers operates in environment where we no longer own an adjacent hospital and such former hospital has ceased operations, although an unaffiliated healthcare provider intends to re-open an emergency department adjacent to our Gilmer Nursing Home. 

Managed Care 

Our subsidiary hospital is affected by its ability to negotiate service contracts with purchasers of group healthcare services. HMOs and PPOs attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services through managed care programs. In addition, employers and traditional health insurers increasingly are seeking to contain costs 

&#160;

through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges. Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group healthcare service purchasers on the basis of market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of medical staff, convenience and price. 

The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market, depending on the market strength of such organizations. Nevertheless, a significant portion of hospital patients in our hospital community are covered by managed care or other reimbursement programs, all of which generally pay less than established charges for hospital services. 

The healthcare industry as a whole faces the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care while managing rising costs, facing strong competition for patients, and adjusting to a continued general reduction of reimbursement rates by both private and government payors. Both private and government payors continually seek to reduce the nature and scope of services which may be reimbursed. Healthcare reform at both the federal and state level generally has created pressure to reduce reimbursement rates. Changes in medical technology, existing and future legislation, regulations and interpretations, and competitive contracting for provider services by private and government payors, have required and in the future may further require changes in our facility, equipment, personnel, rates and/or services. 

Efforts to Control Healthcare Costs 

Rural hospitals, including the Trace Hospital owned and operated by SunLink&#146;s subsidiary, continue to have significant unused capacity. Inpatient utilization and average inpatient occupancy rates continue to be affected negatively by payor-required pre-admission authorization, utilization review, and payment mechanisms designed to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients and to limit the cost of treating inpatients. Admissions constraints, payor pressures, and increased competition are likely to continue. Historically, hospitals owned and operated by SunLink&#146;s subsidiaries have responded to such trends by adding and expanding outpatient services, upgrading facilities and equipment, offering new programs (such as geriatric psychiatric units) and adding or expanding certain inpatient and ancillary services. In addition, our hospitals have reduced services and taken beds out of service in response to such trends. Currently we expect our Trace Hospital will continue to respond to such trends in a similar manner subject to the availability of capital resources and our evaluation of the continued utility of such historical responses. 

Health Care Reform 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the &#147;Affordable Care Act&#148; or &#147;ACA&#148;) were signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010, and March 30, 2010, respectively. The ACA alters the United States health care system and is intended to decrease the number of uninsured Americans and reduce overall health care costs. The ACA attempts to achieve these goals by, among other things, requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a tax penalty, expanding Medicare and Medicaid eligibility, reducing Medicare and Medicaid payments including disproportionate share payments, expanding the Medicare program&#146;s use of value-based purchasing programs, tying hospital payments to the satisfaction of certain quality criteria, and bundling payments to hospitals and other providers. The ACA also contains a number of measures that are intended to reduce fraud and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, such as requiring the use of recovery audit contractors in the Medicaid program and generally prohibiting physician-owned hospitals from adding new physician owners or increasing the number of beds and operating rooms for which they are licensed. We believe the implementation or interpretation of rules and regulations or the provisions of the ACA may have and may continue to have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operations, especially since the one state in which we operate our hospital has decided not to set up state exchanges and not to expand Medicaid.

SPECIALTY PHARMACY OPERATIONS 

Our Specialty Pharmacy Segment is operated through SunLink ScriptsRx, LLC (&#147;Scripts&#148;), a wholly-owned subsidiary, and composed of four material service lines: 

&#160;

&#160; 1. Retail Pharmacy Products and Services, consisting of pharmacy sales at our three retail locations in Louisiana and including complementary products such as uniforms, vitamins, supplements and nutritionals. &#160;

&#160; 2. Institutional Pharmacy Services, consisting of the provision of specialty and non-specialty pharmaceuticals and biological products to institutional clients or to patients in institutional settings, such as nursing homes, specialty hospitals, hospices and correctional facilities; &#160;

&#160; 3. Specialty Pharmacy Services, which ordinarily include one or more of the following elements: &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The provision of products relating to infusion therapy, enteral feeding services, oncology and chemotherapy drug administration, and cardiac, diabetes, pain management, wound care and psychiatric services; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pharmaceutical or biological products administered via non-oral means, which are frequently through injectable or infusion therapies; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Products delivered to patients via express package or hand delivery and requiring special handling, such as constant refrigeration or having an extremely limited shelf life; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Products that generally are administered in a non-hospital setting, including physicians&#146; offices, specialty clinics or patients&#146; homes; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The provision of pharmaceuticals or biological products not managed under traditional outpatient prescription drug benefits; and, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Therapies that require complex care, patient education and continuous monitoring. The major conditions these drugs treat include, but are not limited to, respiratory system weakness, cancer, HIV/AIDS, hemophilia, hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis, infertility, Crohn&#146;s disease, rheumatoid arthritis and growth hormone deficiency. 

&#160;

&#160; 4. Durable Medical Equipment Services, consisting primarily of products for patient-administered home care such as oxygen concentrator services, continuous and variable/bi-level positive airway pressure (&#147;CPAP&#148; and &#147;VPAP&#148;/&#147;BPAP&#148;) machines, nebulizers, diabetes management products and prosthetics. Pharmacy Competition 

There are many companies which provide one or more of the healthcare operations which comprise or may compete with our specialty pharmacy operations of Scripts. For example, home healthcare business companies, which may compete with our specialty pharmacy services, our durable medical equipment services operations or both, range in size from small entrepreneurial companies to rapidly expanding companies with strategies for national operations, such as Amedisys, Inc., Apria Healthcare Group, Inc., Kindred Healthcare, Inc., and Walgreen Co. Specialty pharmacy companies range from local or regional pharmacies to large public companies, such as CVS Health Corporation (CVS Specialty), Express Scripts (Accredo Health Group, Inc.), Walgreen Co. and BioScript Inc. Institutional pharmacy companies likewise range from local or regional pharmacies to large public companies including CVS Health Corporation (Omnicare, Inc.) and PharMerica Corporation. 

GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS 

Government Reimbursement Programs&#151;Hospitals 

A significant portion of SunLink&#146;s healthcare facilities net revenues are dependent upon reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or &#147;CMS&#148; is the federal agency 

&#160;

which administers Medicare, Medicaid and the Children&#146;s Health Insurance Program (&#147;CHIP&#148;). The federal government generally reviews payment rates under its various programs annually, and changes in reimbursement rates under such programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, generally occur based on the fiscal year of the federal government which currently begins on October 1 and ends on September 30 of each year. 

Medicare Inpatient Reimbursement 

The Medicare program currently pays hospitals under the provisions of a prospective payment system for most inpatient services. Under the inpatient prospective payment system, a hospital receives a fixed amount for inpatient hospital services based on the established fixed payment amount per discharge for categories of hospital treatment, known as diagnosis related groups (&#147;DRGs&#148;). Each patient admitted for care is assigned to a DRG based upon a primary admitting diagnosis. Every DRG is assigned a payment rate by the government based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis. DRG payments do not consider a specific hospital&#146;s costs, but are national rates adjusted for area wage differentials and case-mix indices. 

DRG rates are usually adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year (&#147;FFY&#148;). The percentage increases to DRG payment rates for the last several years have been lower than the percentage increases in the related cost of goods and services provided by general hospitals. The index used to adjust the DRG payment rates is based on a price statistic, known as the CMS Market Basket Index, reduced by congressionally mandated reduction factors and other factors imposed by CMS. 

DRG rate increases were 1.4% , 0.9% and 0.95% for FFY 2015 , 2016, and 2017 respectively. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 originally set the increase in DRG payment rates for future FFYs at rates that would be based on the market basket index, which in certain years have been, and in the future may be, subject to reduction factors. If the update factor does not adequately reflect increases in the cost of providing inpatient services by our subsidiary&#146;s hospital, our financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. 

The ACA combined with the America Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (&#147;ATRA&#148;) and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (&#147;MARA&#148;) made a number of changes to Medicare which include but are not limited to: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Reduction of market basket updates in Medicare payment rates for providers, to incorporate an adjustment for expected productivity gains. The market basket was reduced by 0.25% for both FFY 2010 and 2011, 0.10% for FFY 2012, 0.10% in FFY 2013 and 0.30% in FFY 2014; and will be reduced by 0.20% in 2015 and 2016, and by 0.75% in FFYs 2017-2019. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Reduction of Medicare payments that would otherwise be made to hospitals by specified percentages to account for preventable hospital readmissions, as defined by CMS, effective October 1, 2012. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Extension of the Medicare Dependent Hospital Program until September 30, 2017. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Expansion, on a temporary basis, of the low volume hospital inpatient payment adjustment to include hospitals that are more than 15 miles from other healthcare facilities and have less than 1,600 discharges per year. The new temporary criteria were effective for FFYs 2011 through 2013 and further expanded through September 30, 2017. Effective FFY 2018, the low-volume hospital definition and payment adjustment methodology is scheduled to return to the pre-FFY 2011 definition and methodology. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hospitals that do not successfully participate in the Hospital IQR Program and do not submit the required quality data will be subject to a one-fourth reduction of the market basket update. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A requirement that any hospital which is not a meaningful electronic health records user will be reduced by one-half of the market basket update in FY 2016. Our subsidiary hospital does not expect to attest as a meaningful electronic records user for FY 2016. &#160;

SunLink&#146;s subsidiary hospital is an eligible hospital under one or more provisions of ACA, ATRA and MARA. 

Medicare Outpatient Reimbursement 

Most outpatient services provided by general hospitals are reimbursed by Medicare under the outpatient prospective payment system. This outpatient prospective payment system is based on a system of Ambulatory Payment Classifications (&#147;APC&#148;). Each APC is designed to represent a &#147;bundle&#148; of outpatient services, and each APC is assigned a fully prospective reimbursement rate. Medicare pays a set price or rate for each APC group, regardless of the actual cost incurred in providing care. Each APC rate generally is subject to adjustment each year by an &#147;update factor&#148; based on a market basket of services index. For calendar year 2015, the update factor was 2.4% and for calendar year 2016 it was (0.3%). For calendar year 2017 is expected to be 1.55%. If the update factor for current and future periods does not adequately reflect increases in SunLink&#146;s subsidiary hospital cost of providing outpatient services, our financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. 

Medicare Bad Debt Reimbursement 

Under Medicare, the costs attributable to the deductible and coinsurance amounts that remain unpaid by Medicare beneficiaries can be partially added to, and reimbursed as a portion of, the Medicare share of allowable costs as cost reports are filed. Bad debts must meet specific criteria to be allowable. Hospitals generally receive interim pass-through payments during the cost report year which are determined by the respective Medicare Audit Contractor (&#147;MAC&#148;) from the prior cost report filing, and which are finally adjusted when cost reports are filed and audited. 

Amounts uncollectible from specific beneficiaries are charged off as bad debts in the accounting period in which the accounts are deemed to be worthless. In some cases, an amount previously written off as a bad debt and allocated to the program may be recovered in a subsequent accounting period. In these cases, the recoveries must be used to reduce the cost of beneficiary services for the period in which the collection is made. In determining reasonable costs for hospitals, the amount of bad debts otherwise treated as allowable costs was reduced by 35% beginning FFY 2014. 

Medicare Disproportionate Share Payments 

In addition to the standard DRG payment, the Social Security Act requires that additional Medicare payments be made to hospitals with a disproportionate share of low income patients. Beneficiary Improvement and Protection Act (&#147;BIPA&#148;) provisions stipulate that rural facilities with fewer than 100 beds with a disproportionate share percentage greater than 15% will be classified as a disproportionate share hospital and is entitled to receive a supplemental disproportionate share payment based on gross DRG payments. Since April 1, 2004, the effective rate has been 12.0% of DRG payments. Trace Hospital is classified as a disproportionate share hospital as of July 1, 2016. The Affordable Care Act provides for material reductions in Medicare DSH funding. We estimate that Medicare disproportionate share payments represented approximately 1% of our net patient service revenues for the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014. 

Medicaid Inpatient and Outpatient Reimbursement 

Each state operates a Medicaid program funded jointly by the state and the federal government. Federal law governs the general management of the Medicaid program, but there is wide latitude for states to customize Medicaid programs to fit local needs and resources. As a result, each state Medicaid plan has its own payment formula and recipient eligibility criteria. 

In the recent past, the state in which our subsidiary operates its hospital has initiated increased efforts to reduce Medicaid assistance payments. These efforts and reductions often are triggered by one or more of the 

&#160;

following factors: an increased effort by CMS to decrease the federal share of payments for Medicaid beneficiaries or significant increases in program utilization resulting from increased enrollment or budgetary pressures on the applicable states. The federal government&#146;s percentage share of each state&#146;s medical assistance expenditures under Medicaid is determined by a formula specified in Medicaid law referred to as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (&#147;FMAP&#148;). 

The states in which SunLink subsidiaries have operated hospitals have implemented initiatives to decrease the Medicaid funds paid to providers. Medicaid pays providers for inpatient services in a manner similar to the Medicare prospective payment system in that hospitals receive a fixed fee for inpatient hospital services based on the established fixed payment amount per discharge for categories of hospital treatment, also known as DRGs. These Medicaid DRG payments do not consider a specific hospital&#146;s costs, but are statewide rates adjusted for each subsidiaries&#146; hospitals&#146; capital cost allotment. 

Medicaid outpatient services are reimbursed with interim rates based on a facility specific cost to charge ratio. These interim payments are then adjusted subsequent to the end of the cost reporting period to an amount equal to 85.6% of the costs associated with providing care to the Medicaid outpatient population. 

If SunLink or our subsidiaries or any of their facilities were found to be in violation of federal or state laws relating to Medicare, Medicaid or similar programs, SunLink or the applicable subsidiary or facility could be subject to substantial monetary fines, civil penalties and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Adoption of Electronic Health Records 

Electronic Health Records (&#147;EHR&#148;) incentive reimbursements are payments received under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the &#147;HITECH Act&#148;) which was enacted into law in 2009 as part of ARRA. The HITECH Act includes provisions designed to increase the use of EHR by both physicians and hospitals. Beginning with federal fiscal year 2011 and extending through federal fiscal year 2016, eligible hospitals participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs are eligible for reimbursement incentives based on successfully demonstrating meaningful use of their certified EHR technology. Conversely, those hospitals that do not successfully demonstrate meaningful use of EHR technology are subject to payment penalties or downward adjustments to their Medicare payments beginning in federal fiscal year 2015. 

The Company accounts for EHR incentive payments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) 450-30, &#147;Gain Contingencies&#148; (&#147;ASC 450-30&#148;). In accordance with ASC 450-30, the Company recognizes a gain for EHR incentive payments when the applicable eligible subsidiary hospital has demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable period and when the cost report information needed for the full cost report year used for the final calculation of the EHR incentive reimbursement payment is available. The demonstration of meaningful use is based on meeting a series of objectives and varies among hospitals, between the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and within the Medicaid program from state to state. Additionally, meeting the series of objectives in order to demonstrate meaningful use becomes progressively more stringent as its implementation is phased in through stages as outlined by the CMS. 

&#160;

Attestation of Medicare meaningful use requirements was successful for each of SunLink&#146;s hospital subsidiaries&#146; including certain discontinued operations for fiscal years ended June 30, 2014. SunLink&#146;s hospital subsidiaries have also successfully attested to the meaningful use requirements for the Medicaid program for continuing and certain discontinued operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014. EHR incentive payments received (repaid) were as follows:

&#160; The amounts in the table above represent actual funds received from meeting the meaningful use requirements for Medicare and Medicaid programs. The discontinued operations Medicare funds received in fiscal 2015 were for attestation of the meaningful use requirements in fiscal 2014. Amounts recognized may differ due to year-end adjustments and final settlement of cost reports. 

The Company received no Medicare meaningful use payments in continuing operations in fiscal 2016 and 2015 because, based on its cost-benefit evaluation, it chose not to attest for such payments. We currently believe we will receive no Medicare incentive payments and minimal Medicaid incentive payments in future years. 

Government Reimbursement Program Administration and Adjustments 

The Medicare, Medicaid and TriCare programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review and changing governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments under such programs. 

All hospitals participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenues, costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each subsidiary hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients. 

Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to routine audits which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due under these reimbursement programs. These audits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts due. Providers have rights of appeal and it is common to contest issues raised in audits. Although the final outcome of these audits and the nature and amounts of any adjustments are difficult to predict, we believe that we have made adequate provisions in our financial statements for adjustments that may result from these audits and that final resolution of any contested issues should not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. Until final adjustment, however, significant issues may remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or greater than ultimately required. 

&#160;

In 2005, CMS began using recovery audit contractors (&#147;RACs&#148;) to detect Medicare overpayments not identified through existing claims review mechanisms. The RAC program relies on private companies to examine Medicare claims filed by healthcare providers. The RAC program was made permanent by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. The ACA expanded the RAC program&#146;s scope to include managed Medicare and Medicaid claims, and required all states to establish programs to contract with RACs by 2011. Currently all states where our subsidiaries operate have RAC programs, and all their facilities have had requests from the various RACs to review claims. 

RACs perform post-discharge audits of medical records to identify Medicare overpayments resulting from incorrect payment amounts, non-covered services, incorrectly coded services, and duplicate services. CMS has given RACs the authority to look back at claims up to three years old, provided that the claim was paid on or after October 1, 2007. Claims review strategies used by RACs generally include a review of high dollar claims, including inpatient hospital claims. As a result, a large majority of the total amounts recovered by RACs has come from hospitals. Claims identified as overpayments are subject to an appeals process and the Company&#146;s hospitals routinely appeal RAC overpayment determinations. Under the RAC program, SunLink has experienced losses in the aggregate from audit adjustments of approximately $0, $86 and $153 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

RACs are paid a contingency fee based on the overpayments they identify and collect. We expect that the RACs will continue to look closely at claims submitted by our subsidiary facility in an attempt to identify possible overpayments. Although we believe the claims for reimbursement submitted to the Medicare program are accurate, we cannot predict the results of any future RAC audits. 

In addition, CMS employs Medicaid Integrity Contractors (&#147;MICs&#148;) to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. The ACA increases federal funding for the MIC program for federal fiscal year 2011 and later years. In addition to RACs and MICs, the state Medicaid agencies and other contractors have also increased their review activities. 

Government Reimbursement Programs&#151;Nursing Centers 

Medicare &#151;The Medicare Part A program provides reimbursement for extended-care services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries who are admitted to nursing centers after at least a three-day stay in an acute care hospital. Covered services include supervised nursing care, room and board, social services, physical, speech, and occupational therapies, certain pharmaceuticals and supplies, and other necessary services provided by nursing centers. Medicare payments to our nursing centers are based upon certain resource utilization grouping (&#147;RUG&#148;) payment rates developed by CMS that provide various levels of reimbursement based upon patient acuity. 

The Balanced Budget Act established a Medicare prospective payment system (&#147;PPS&#148;) for nursing centers in 1998. The payments received under PPS cover substantially all services for Medicare residents including all ancillary services, such as respiratory therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and certain covered pharmaceuticals. 

Medicare Part B provides reimbursement for certain physician services, limited drug coverage, and other outpatient services, such as therapy and other services, outside of a Medicare Part A covered patient stay. Payment for these services is determined according to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (&#147;MPFS&#148;). Annually since 1997, the MPFS has been subject to the sustainable growth rate adjustment (&#147;SGR&#148;) reduction, which is intended to keep spending growth in line with allowable spending. Each year since the SGR was enacted, this adjustment produced a scheduled negative update to payment for physicians, therapists, and other healthcare providers paid under the MPFS. Annually, since 2002, Congress has stepped in with so-called &#147;doc fix&#148; legislation to suspend payment cuts to physicians. Subsequent legislation annually suspended the payment cut with the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, enacted on April 1, 2014 (&#147;PAMA&#148;) most recently 

&#160;

suspending the payment cut until March 31, 2015.The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (&#147;MACRA&#148;) permanently replaces the SGR formula previously used to determine updates to Medicare physician reimbursement, replacing these updates with quality and value measurements and participation in alternative payment models. 

Since 2006, federal legislation has provided for an annual Medicare Part B outpatient therapy cap. In years since 2006, CMS has increased the amount of the therapy cap. In addition, legislation was passed that required CMS to implement a broad process for reviewing medically necessary therapy claims, creating an exception to the cap. Legislation has annually extended the Medicare Part B outpatient therapy cap exception process. MACRA further extended the therapy cap exception process until December 31, 2017. This review process has had an adverse effect on the provision and billing of services for patients and can negatively impact therapist productivity. Patients whose stay is not reimbursed by Medicare Part A must seek reimbursement for their therapy under Medicare Part B and are subject to the therapy cap. 

In 2006, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (&#147;Medicare Part D&#148;) implemented a major expansion of the Medicare program through the introduction of a prescription drug benefit. Under Medicare Part D, dual-eligible patients have their outpatient prescription drug costs covered by this Medicare benefit, subject to certain limitations. Most of our nursing center patients are dual-eligible patients who qualify for the Medicare drug benefit. Accordingly, Medicaid is no longer a primary payor for the pharmacy services provided to these patients. 

On July 31, 2013, CMS issued final regulations updating Medicare payment rates for nursing centers effective October 1, 2013. These final regulations implement a net market basket increase of 1.3% consisting of: (1) a 2.3% market basket inflation increase, less (2) a 0.5% adjustment to account for the effect of a productivity adjustment, and less (3) a 0.5% market basket forecast error adjustment. 

On April 1, 2014, PAMA was enacted, which directed CMS to create a value-based purchasing initiative applicable to nursing centers beginning October 1, 2018. The initiative will focus on a preventable hospital readmission measure to be provided on or before October 1, 2015 and corresponding preventable hospital readmission rates to be provided on or before October 1, 2016. Nursing centers will be ranked according to performance on this preventable hospital readmission rate, with corresponding incentive payments based upon such ranking. CMS also will reduce the Medicare per diem rate by 2% beginning October 1, 2018 in connection with the launch of this initiative. 

On July 31, 2014, CMS issued final regulations updating Medicare payment rates for nursing centers effective October 1, 2014. These final regulations implement a net market basket increase of 2.0% consisting of: (1) a 2.5% market basket inflation increase, less (2) a 0.5% adjustment to account for the effect of a productivity adjustment. 

On July 30, 2015, CMS issued final regulations updating Medicare payment rates for nursing centers effective October 1, 2015. These final regulations implement a net market basket increase of 1.2% consisting of: (1) a 2.3% market basket increase, less (2) a 0.6% market basket forecast error adjustment and (3) a 0.5% productivity adjustment. 

In February 2012, the Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 2012 was enacted, which provides that certain Medicare Part B therapy services exceeding a threshold of $3,700 would be subject to a pre-payment manual medical review process effective October 1, 2012. The review process for these services continues to be used by CMS. This review process has had an adverse effect on the provision and billing of services for patients and can negatively impact therapist productivity. 

In February 2012, Congress passed The Job Creation Act of 2012 (the &#147;Job Creation Act&#148;), which provides for reductions in reimbursement of Medicare bad debts for nursing centers. The Job Creation Act provides for a 

&#160;

phase-in of the reduction in the rate of reimbursement for bad debts of patients that are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. The rate of reimbursement for bad debts for these dually eligible patients were reduced from 100% to 88% for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2012 and was reduced to 76% for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2013, and was reduced to 65% for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 2, 2014. The rate of reimbursement for bad debts for patients not dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid was reduced from 70% to 65%, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2012. 

The Budget Control Act of 2011 (as amended by the Taxpayer Relief Act) instituted an automatic 2% reduction on each claim submitted to Medicare beginning April 1, 2013. 

Medicaid &#151;Medicaid is a state-administered program financed by state funds and matching federal funds. The program provides for medical assistance to the indigent and certain other eligible persons. Although administered under broad federal regulations, states are given flexibility to construct programs and payment methods consistent with their individual goals. Accordingly, these programs differ in many respects from state to state. 

Our subsidiary nursing centers provide Medicaid-covered services consisting of nursing care, room and board, and social services to eligible individuals. In addition, states may at their option cover other services such as physical, occupational, and speech therapies, and pharmaceuticals. Medicaid programs also are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy by the state agencies, and certain government funding limitations, all of which may materially increase or decrease the level of program payments to our subsidiary nursing centers. We believe that the payments under many of these programs may not be sufficient on an overall basis to cover the costs of serving certain patients participating in these programs. In addition, many states are experiencing budgetary pressures which have resulted in further reductions to Medicaid payments to our nursing centers. 

There continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals that would impose further limitations on government and private payments to providers of healthcare services. Many states are considering or have enacted measures that are designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures and to make certain changes to private healthcare insurance. As states face budgetary issues, we anticipate further pressure on Medicaid rates that could negatively impact payments to our nursing centers. 

In addition, some states seek to increase the levels of funding contributed by the federal government to their Medicaid programs through a mechanism known as a provider tax. Under these programs, states levy a tax on healthcare providers, which increases the amount of state revenue available to expend on the Medicaid program. This increase in program revenues increases the payment made by the federal government to the state in the form of matching funds. Consequently, the state then has more funds available to support Medicaid rates for providers of Medicaid covered services. However, states may not necessarily use these funds to increase payments to nursing center providers. Provider tax plans are subject to approval by the federal government. Although some of these plans have been approved in the past, we cannot assure you that such plans will be approved by the federal government in the future. 

Nongovernment payments &#151;Although our nursing centers seek to maximize the number of nongovernment payment residents admitted to our nursing centers, including those covered under private insurance and managed care health plans, nongovernment payment residents in our nursing centers are limited. Nongovernment payment residents typically have financial resources (including insurance coverage) to pay for their services and do not rely on government programs for support. It is important to our business to establish relationships with commercial insurers, managed care health plans, and other private payors and to maintain our reputation with such payors as a provider of quality patient and resident care. We negotiate contracts with purchasers of group healthcare services, including private employers, commercial insurers, and managed care companies. Most payor organizations attempt to obtain discounts from established charges. We focus on 

&#160;

demonstrating to these payors how our services can provide them and their customers with the most viable pricing arrangements in circumstances where they may otherwise be faced with funding treatment at higher rates at other healthcare providers. The importance of obtaining contracts with commercial insurers, managed care health plans and other private payors varies among markets, depending on such factors as the number of commercial payors and their relative market strength. Failure to obtain contracts with certain commercial insurers and managed care health plans or reductions in lengths of stay or payments for our services provided to individuals covered by commercial insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 

Government Reimbursement Programs &#151;Pharmacy 

The operations of our Specialty Pharmacy Segment are subject to certain rules implemented by the Medicare Modernization Act (&#147;MMA&#148;) and, in the future, may be subject to other rules previously implemented by MMA with respect to urban providers. Regulations implementing cost containment mandates under MMA reduced the reimbursement for healthcare providers in urban areas for a number of products and services which are also provided by our pharmacy operations and established a competitive bidding program for certain durable medical equipment provided under Medicare Part B in urban areas. Competitive bidding is intended to further reduce reimbursement for certain products and will likely decrease the number of companies permitted to serve Medicare beneficiaries in the competitive bidding areas (&#147;CBAs&#148;). CMS had planned to implement the competitive bidding program for Medicare durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (&#147;DMEPOS&#148;) products and services with the goal of offering beneficiaries access to quality with lower out-of-pocket costs. Prior to January 1, 2016, our Scripts operations were exempted under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 from the proposed competitive acquisition program for DMEPOS. However, on October 31, 2014, the CMS released Final Rule 1614-F, &#147;Medicare Program: End-Stage Renal Disease Prospective Payment System, Quality Incentive Program, and Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies,&#148; which, in conjunction with Sections 1834(a)(1)(F) and 1842(s)(3)(B) of the Social Security Act, established the methodology to expand competitive bidding to non-bid areas and to implement national price adjustments to payments for DMEPOS and enteral nutrition products previously paid under fee schedules. Under these rules and the resulting expansion plan, CMS applied competitive bidding prices to claims for DMEPOS and enteral nutrition products in previously non-bid areas currently covered in Rounds One and Two of the Competitive Bidding Program (CBP). An un-weighted average of all of the single payment amounts from the CBAs in each of the eight distinct CBAs was used to determine a regional single payment amount (RSPA) for each covered item in each CBA. From January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016, reimbursement rates for affected product categories were reduced significantly, based on the sum of 50 percent of the current unadjusted fee schedule amount plus 50 percent of the RSPAs. Then, on July 1, 2016, the reimbursement rates were reduced further to fully implement the bidding-derived rates (i.e., 100% of the adjusted fee schedule amount, based on regional competitive bidding rates). We cannot assure you that Scripts will be able to operate its DMEPOS and enteral nutrition products operations profitably in the future at either existing or at the July 1, 2016 lower reimbursement rates. The MMA also created a Medicare prescription drug benefit (which began in 2006) and a prescription drug card program. Final rules implementing the portions of the MMA relating to the prescription drug benefit were adopted in 2005. 

Under MMA Medicare Part B, covered drugs and biological products generally are paid based on the average sales price (&#147;ASP&#148;) methodology. The ASP methodology uses quarterly drug pricing data submitted to CMS by drug manufacturers. CMS will supply contractors with the ASP drug pricing files for Medicare Part B drugs on a quarterly basis. Principal products paid under the ASP methodology include certain oncology and renal dialysis drugs. Although, there are exceptions to this general rule which are listed in the latest ASP quarterly change request document and which exceptions generally are paid on a cost basis, such exceptions have not been and are not expected to be material to our operations. 

Beginning in January 2008, CMS&#146;s outpatient prospective payment system began paying for most separately payable Medicare Part B drugs administered in a hospital outpatient setting at a reimbursement level of ASP plus 5% and ASP plus 6% in other settings. Such outpatient price represented a decrease from ASP plus 6%. 

&#160;

Section 303(d) of the MMA also requires the implementation of a competitive acquisition program (the &#147;Part B CAP&#148;) for Medicare Part B drugs and biological not paid on a cost or prospective payment system basis. The Part B CAP is an alternative to the ASP methodology for acquiring certain Part B drugs which are administered incident to a physician&#146;s services. Currently, the Part B CAP is a voluntary program that offers physicians the option to acquire many injectable and infused drugs they use in their practice from an approved Part B CAP vendor, thus reducing the time and cost of buying and billing for drugs. Currently, the CAP for Part B Drugs and Biologicals is only for injectable and infused drugs currently billed under Part B that are administered in a physician&#146;s office, &#147;incident to&#148; a physician&#146;s service. 

In late 2005, CMS conducted the first round of bidding for approved Part B CAP vendors. The Part B CAP was implemented on July 1, 2006. The 2009-2011 CAP vendor bidding period concluded on February 15, 2008. CMS received several qualified bids; however, contractual issues with the successful bidders resulted in the 2009 program being postponed by CMS in September 2008. As a result, CAP drugs were not available from an approved CAP vendor for dates of service after December 31, 2008. 

At least one Medicaid program has adopted, and other Medicaid programs, some states and some private payors may be expected to adopt, those aspects of the MMA that either result in or appear to result in price reductions for drugs covered by such programs. Adoption of ASP as the measure for determining reimbursement by Medicare and Medicaid programs for additional drugs sold by our specialty pharmacy operations could reduce revenue and gross margins and could materially affect our current average wholesale price (&#147;AWP&#148;) based reimbursement structure with private payors. 

We cannot assure you that the ASP reimbursement methodology will not be extended to the provision of all specialty pharmaceuticals or to the specialty pharmaceuticals most often sold by our Scripts specialty pharmacy operations or that Scripts will be able to operate its specialty pharmacy operations profitably at either existing or at lower reimbursement rates. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Part B CAP program will not be extended to rural or exurban areas in general or to the areas in which it operates, or may seek to operate, in particular or that Scripts would be able to meet the qualifications to become a Part B CAP vendor either now or at any time in the future. 

HEALTHCARE REGULATION 

Overview 

The healthcare industry is governed by an extremely complex framework of federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, and there continue to be federal and state proposals that would, and actions that do, impose limitations on government and private payments to providers, including community hospitals, nursing homes and pharmacy operations. In addition, there regularly are proposals to increase co-payments and deductibles from program and private patients. Hospital facilities also are affected by controls imposed by government and private payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay. Such controls include what is commonly referred to as &#147;utilization review&#148;. Utilization review entails the review of a patient&#146;s admission and course of treatment by a third party. Historically, utilization review has resulted in a decrease in certain treatments and procedures being performed. Utilization review is required in connection with the provision of care which is to be funded by Medicare and Medicaid and is also required under many managed care arrangements. 

Many states have enacted, or are considering enacting, additional measures that are designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance. Various states have applied, or are considering applying, for a waiver from current Medicaid regulations in order to allow them to serve some of their Medicaid participants through managed care providers. These proposals also may attempt to include coverage for some people who presently are uninsured, and generally could have the effect of reducing payments to hospitals, physicians and other providers for the same level of service provided under Medicaid. 

&#160;

Healthcare Facility Regulation 

Certificate of Need Requirements 

A number of states require approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of various healthcare facilities, including findings of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. Certificates of Need (&#147;CONs&#148;), which are issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over applicable healthcare facilities, are at times required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount, changes in bed capacity or the addition of services and certain other matters. The state in which a SunLink subsidiary currently operates a hospital (Mississippi) has a CON law that applies to such facility. The two states (Georgia and Mississippi) in which SunLink subsidiaries currently operate nursing homes/skilled nursing facilities also have CON laws that apply to nursing homes and other skilled nursing facilities. States periodically review, modify and revise their CON laws and related regulations. 

SunLink is unable to predict whether its subsidiaries&#146; healthcare facilities will be able to obtain any CONs that may be necessary to accomplish their business objectives in any jurisdiction where such certificates of need are required. Violation of these state laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of licenses for such facilities. In addition, future healthcare facility acquisitions also may occur in states that require CONs. 

Future healthcare facility acquisitions also may occur in states that do not require CONs or which have less stringent CON requirements than the states in which SunLink subsidiaries currently operate healthcare facilities. Any healthcare facility operated by SunLink in such states may face increased competition from new or expanding facilities operated by competitors, including physicians. 

Utilization Review Compliance and Hospital Governance 

Healthcare facilities are subject to, and comply with, various forms of utilization review. In addition, under the Medicare prospective payment system, each state must have a peer review organization to carry out a federally mandated system of review of Medicare patient admissions, treatments and discharges in hospitals. Medical and surgical services and physician practices are supervised by committees of staff doctors at each healthcare facility, are overseen by each healthcare facility&#146;s local governing board, the primary voting members of which are physicians and community members, and are reviewed by quality assurance personnel. The local governing boards also help maintain standards for quality care, develop long-range plans, establish, review and enforce practices and procedures and approve the credentials and disciplining of medical staff members. 

Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act 

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (&#147;EMTALA&#148;) is a federal law that requires any hospital that participates in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital&#146;s emergency department for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from an emergency medical condition or is in active labor, to either stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to a facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient&#146;s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient&#146;s ability to pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program, the Medicaid program or both. In addition, an injured patient, the patient&#146;s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital&#146;s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against that other hospital. Although we believe that our subsidiaries&#146; hospitals comply with EMTALA, we cannot predict whether CMS will implement new requirements in the future and whether our subsidiaries&#146; hospitals will be able to comply with any new requirements. 

&#160;

Specialty Pharmacy Segment Regulation 

Overview 

Much like our subsidiaries&#146; healthcare facility operations, the operations of our Specialty Pharmacy Segment subsidiary are subject to various federal and state statutes and regulations governing their operations, including laws and regulations with respect to operation of pharmacies, repackaging of drug products, wholesale distribution, dispensing of controlled substances, cross-jurisdictional sale and distribution of pharmacy products, medical waste disposal, clinical trials and non-discriminatory access. Federal statutes and regulations govern the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs, as well as the dispensing of controlled substances. Federal controlled substance laws require us to register our pharmacies and repackaging facilities with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (&#147;DEA&#148;) and to comply with security, recordkeeping, inventory control and labeling standards in order to dispense controlled substances. Although we believe that the operations of our Specialty Pharmacy Segment have obtained the permits and/or licenses required to conduct its specialty pharmacy business as currently conducted, a failure to have the necessary permits and licenses could have a material adverse effect on its specialty pharmacy business, and our financial condition or results of operations. 

Pharmaceutical Distribution 

Scripts conducts the operations of our Specialty Pharmacy Segment. In addition to walk-in customers at its retail centers, it distributes pharmaceuticals through a variety of delivery methods, including by mail and express delivery services. Many states in which Scripts delivers or may seek to deliver pharmaceuticals have laws and regulations that require out-of-state mail service pharmacies to register with, or be licensed by, the boards of pharmacy or similar regulatory bodies in those states. These states generally permit the dispensing pharmacy to follow the laws of the state within which the dispensing pharmacy is located. 

However, various state Medicaid programs have enacted laws and/or adopted rules or regulations directed at restricting or prohibiting the operation of out-of-state pharmacies by, among other things, requiring compliance with all laws of the states into which the out-of-state pharmacy dispenses medications, whether or not those laws conflict with the laws of the state in which the pharmacy is located, or requiring the pharmacist-in-charge to be licensed in that state. To the extent that such laws or regulations are found to be applicable to the specialty pharmacy operations of Scripts, we believe its specialty pharmacy operations comply with them in all material respects. To the extent that any of the foregoing laws or regulations prohibit or restrict the operation of mail service pharmacies and are found to be applicable to the specialty pharmacy operations of Scripts, they could have an adverse effect on its ability to expand our pharmacy operations, which currently are concentrated in Louisiana. A number of state Medicaid programs prohibit the participation in such state&#146;s Medicare program by either out-of-state retail pharmacies or mail order pharmacies, whether located in-state or out-of-state. 

Advertising and Marketing Regulations 

There are also other statutes and regulations which may affect advertising, marketing and distribution of pharmacy products. The Federal Trade Commission requires mail order sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising, to stock a reasonable supply of the products to be sold, to fill mail orders within 30 days, and to provide clients with refunds, when appropriate. 

General Healthcare Regulations 

Drugs and Controlled Substances 

Various licenses and permits are required by our subsidiaries&#146; healthcare facilities and by the specialty pharmacy operations of Scripts in order to dispense narcotics and operate pharmacies. All of our subsidiaries are required to register our pharmacy operations for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with certain operating 

&#160;

and security standards of, the United States DEA, the Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;), state Boards of Pharmacy, state health departments and other state agencies in states where we operate or may seek to operate. 

State controlled substance laws require registration and compliance with state pharmacy licensure, registration or permit standards promulgated by the state&#146;s pharmacy licensing authority. Such standards often address the qualification of an applicant&#146;s personnel, the adequacy of its prescription fulfillment and inventory control practices and the adequacy of its facilities. In general, pharmacy licenses are renewed annually. Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians employed at each of our dispensing locations also must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements. 

Fraud and Abuse, Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Regulations 

Participation in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs is heavily regulated by federal statutes and regulations. If a hospital fails to comply substantially with the numerous federal laws governing a facility&#146;s activities, the hospital&#146;s participation in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs may be terminated and/or civil or criminal penalties may be imposed. For example, a hospital may lose its ability to participate in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs if it: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; makes claims to Medicare and/or Medicaid for services not provided or misrepresents actual services provided in order to obtain higher payments; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; pays money to induce the referral of patients or the purchase of items or services where such items or services are reimbursable under a federal or state health program; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; fails to report or repay improper or excess payments; or &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; fails to provide appropriate emergency medical screening services to any individual who comes to a hospital&#146;s campus or otherwise fails to properly treat and transfer emergency patients. Hospitals continue to be one of the primary focus areas of the Office of the Inspector General (&#147;OIG&#148;) of the United States and other governmental fraud and abuse programs. In January 2005, the OIG issued Supplemental Compliance Program Guidance for Hospitals that focuses on hospital compliance risk areas. Some of the risk areas highlighted by the OIG include correct outpatient procedure coding, revising admission and discharge policies to reflect current CMS rules, submitting appropriate claims for supplemental payments such as pass-through costs and outlier payments and a general discussion of the fraud and abuse risks related to financial relationships with referral sources. Each federal fiscal year, the OIG also publishes a General Work Plan that provides a brief description of the activities that the OIG plans to initiate or continue with respect to the programs and operations of Department of Health and Human Services (&#147;HHS&#148;) and details the areas that the OIG believes are prone to fraud and abuse. 

Sections of the Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments to the Social Security Act, commonly known as the &#147;anti-kickback&#148; statute, prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might influence the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, TriCare or other healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be funded by Medicare or other government programs. Sanctions for violating the anti-kickback statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including fines and possible exclusion from future participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Pursuant to the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987, HHS issued regulations that create safe harbors under the anti-kickback statute. A given business arrangement that does not fall within an enumerated safe harbor is not per se illegal; however, business arrangements that fail to satisfy the applicable safe harbor criteria are subject to increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities. 

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#147;HIPAA&#148;) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal statutes that are not related to receipt of payments from a federal healthcare program. HIPAA created civil penalties for proscribed conduct, including upcoding and billing for 

&#160;

medically unnecessary goods or services. These laws cover all health insurance programs, private as well as governmental. In addition, HIPAA broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws, such as the anti-kickback statute, to include not just Medicare and Medicaid services, but all healthcare services reimbursed under a federal or state healthcare program. Finally, HIPAA established enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse. These mechanisms include a bounty system where a portion of the payment recovered is returned to the government agencies, as well as a whistleblower program, where a portion of the payment received is paid to the whistleblower. HIPAA also expanded the categories of persons that may be excluded from participation in federal and state healthcare programs. 

There is increasing scrutiny by law enforcement authorities, the OIG, the courts and the U.S. Congress of arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as mechanisms to exchange remuneration for patient-care referrals and opportunities. Investigators also have demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a business transaction and to reinterpret the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources. Enforcement actions have increased, as is evidenced by highly publicized enforcement investigations of certain hospital activities. 

In addition, provisions of the Social Security Act, known as the Stark Act, also prohibit physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated health services with which the physicians or their immediate family members have ownership or certain other financial arrangements. Certain exceptions are available for employment agreements, leases, physician recruitment and certain other physician arrangements. A person making a referral, or seeking payment for services referred, in violation of the Stark Act is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $15 for each service; restitution of any amounts received for illegally billed claims; and/or exclusion from future participation in the Medicare program, which can subject the person or entity to exclusion from future participation in state healthcare programs. 

Further, if any physician or entity enters into an arrangement or scheme that the physician or entity knows or should have known has the principal purpose of assuring referrals by the physician to a particular entity, and the physician directly makes referrals to such entity, then such physician or entity could be subject to a civil monetary penalty of up to $100. In addition, the monitoring of compliance with and the enforcing of penalties for violations of these laws and regulations is changing and increasing. For example, in 2010, CMS issued a &#147;self-referral disclosure protocol&#148; for hospitals and other providers that wish to self-disclose potential violations of the Stark Act and attempt to resolve those potential violations and any related overpayment liabilities at levels below the maximum penalties and amounts set forth in the statute. In light of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that created potential liabilities under the federal False Claims Act (discussed below) for failing to report and repay known overpayments and return an overpayment within sixty (60) days of the identification of the overpayment or the date by which a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later, hospitals and other healthcare providers are encouraged to disclose potential violations of the Stark Act to CMS. It is likely that self-disclosure of Stark Act violations will increase in the future. Finally, many states have adopted or are considering similar legislative proposals, some of which extend beyond the Medicaid program, to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self-referrals regardless of the source of the payment for the care. 

The Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws 

The Federal False Claims Act prohibits providers from, among other things, knowingly submitting false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. The False Claims Act defines the term &#147;knowingly&#148; broadly, and while simple negligence generally will not give rise to liability, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity can constitute the &#147;knowing&#148; submission of a false or fraudulent claim for the purposes of the False Claims Act. The &#147;qui tam&#148; or &#147;whistleblower&#148; provisions of the False Claims Act allow private individuals to bring actions under the False Claims Act on behalf of the government. These private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, the number of &#147;whistleblower&#148; 

&#160;

lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years. When a private party brings a qui tam action under the False Claims Act, the defendant will generally not be aware of the lawsuit until the government makes a determination whether it will intervene and take a lead in the litigation. If a provider is found to be liable under the False Claims Act, the provider may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government plus mandatory civil monetary penalties of between $5 to $11 for each separate false claim. The government has used the False Claims Act to prosecute Medicare and other government healthcare program fraud such as coding errors, billing for services not provided, submitting false cost reports, and providing care that is not medically necessary or that is substandard in quality. 

HIPAA Transaction, Privacy and Security Requirements 

HIPAA and federal regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA contain, among other measures, provisions that have required SunLink and our subsidiaries to implement modified or new computer systems, employee training programs and business procedures. The federal regulations are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry, provide for the confidentiality and privacy of patient healthcare information and ensure the security of healthcare information. 

A violation of the HIPAA regulations could result in civil money penalties of $1 per incident, up to a maximum of $25 per person, per year, per standard violated. HIPAA also provides for criminal penalties of up to $50 and one year in prison for knowingly and improperly obtaining or disclosing protected health information, up to $100 and five years in prison for obtaining protected health information under false pretenses and up to $250 and ten years in prison for obtaining or disclosing protected health information with the intent to sell, transfer or use such information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. Since there is limited history of enforcement efforts by the federal government at this time, it is difficult to ascertain the likelihood of enforcement efforts in connection with the HIPAA regulations or the potential for fines and penalties, which may result from any violation of the regulations. 

HIPAA Privacy Regulations 

HIPAA privacy regulations protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information. The regulations provide increased patient control over medical records, mandate substantial financial penalties for violation of a patient&#146;s right to privacy and, with a few exceptions, require that an individual&#146;s individually identifiable health information only be used for healthcare-related purposes. These privacy standards apply to all health plans, all healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers, such as our subsidiaries&#146; facilities, that transmit health information in an electronic form in connection with standard transactions, and apply to individually identifiable information held or disclosed by a covered entity in any form. These standards impose extensive administrative requirements on our subsidiaries&#146; facilities and require compliance with rules governing the use and disclosure of such health information, and they require our subsidiaries&#146; facilities to impose these rules, by contract, on any business associate to whom we disclose such information in order to perform functions on behalf of our subsidiaries&#146; facilities. In addition, our subsidiaries&#146; facilities are subject to any state laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary by state and could impose stricter standards and additional penalties. 

The HIPAA privacy regulations also require healthcare providers to implement and enforce privacy policies to ensure compliance with the regulations and standards. In conjunction with a private HIPAA consultant and HIPAA coordinators at each facility, individually tailored policies and procedures were developed and implemented and HIPAA privacy educational programs are presented to all employees and physicians at each facility. We believe all of our subsidiaries&#146; facilities are in compliance with current HIPAA privacy regulations. 

HIPAA Electronic Data Standards 

The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for all healthcare related electronic data interchange. These provisions are intended to 

&#160;

streamline and encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry. Among other things, these provisions require healthcare facilities to use standard data formats and code sets established by HHS when electronically transmitting information in connection with certain transactions, including health claims and equivalent encounter information, healthcare payment and remittance advice and health claim status. 

The HHS regulations establish electronic data transmission standards that all healthcare providers and payors must use when submitting and receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions. The uniform data transmission standards are designed to enable healthcare providers to exchange billing and payment information directly with the many payors thereby eliminating data clearinghouses and simplifying the interface programs necessary to perform this function. We believe that the management information systems at our subsidiaries comply with HIPAA&#146;s electronic data regulations and standards. 

HIPAA Security Standards 

The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA require the use of a series of security standards for the protection of electronic health information. The HIPAA security standards rule specifies a series of administrative, technical and physical security procedures for covered entities to use to assure the confidentiality of electronic protected health information. The standards are delineated into either required or addressable implementation specifications. 

In conjunction with a consortium of rural hospitals, private HIPAA security consultants and HIPAA security officers at each facility, our subsidiaries have performed security assessments, and implemented individually tailored plans to apply required or addressable solutions and implemented a set of security policies and procedures. In addition, our subsidiaries developed and adopted an individually tailored comprehensive disaster contingency plan for each facility and presented a HIPAA security training program to all applicable personnel. We believe SunLink and our subsidiaries are in compliance with all aspects of the HIPAA security regulations. 

HIPAA National Provider Identifier 

HIPAA also required HHS to issue regulations establishing standard unique health identifiers for individuals, employers, health plans and healthcare providers to be used in connection with standard electronic transactions. All healthcare providers, including our facilities, were required to obtain a new National Provider Identifier (&#147;NPI&#148;) to be used in standard transactions instead of other numerical identifiers by May 23, 2007. Our facilities implemented use of a standard unique healthcare identifier by utilizing their employer identification number. HHS has not yet issued proposed rules that establish the standard for unique health identifiers for health plans or individuals. Once these regulations are issued in final form, we expect to have approximately one to two years to become fully compliant, but cannot predict the impact of such changes at this time. We cannot predict whether our facilities may experience payment delays during the transition to the new identifiers. HHS is currently working on the standards for identifiers for health plans; however, there are currently no proposed timelines for issuance of proposed or final rules. The issuance of proposed rules for individuals is on hold indefinitely. 

Medical Waste Regulations 

Our operations, especially our healthcare facility operations, generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. Our operations are also generally subject to various other environmental laws, rules and regulations. Based on our current level of operations, we do not anticipate that such compliance costs will have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial position or results of operations. 

&#160;

Regulatory Compliance Program 

Our subsidiaries maintain compliance programs under the direction of a risk manager. The compliance programs are directed at all areas of regulatory compliance, including physician recruitment, reimbursement and cost reporting practices, as well as pharmacy and home healthcare operations. Each hospital and the specialty pharmacy operations designates a compliance officer and develops plans to correct problems should they arise. In addition, all employees are provided with a copy of and given an introduction to the subsidiary&#146;s Code of Conduct , which includes ethical and compliance guidelines and instructions about the proper resources to utilize in order to address any concerns that may arise. Each hospital and the specialty pharmacy operations conduct annual training to re-emphasize its Code of Conduct and monitor its compliance program to respond to developments in healthcare regulations and the industry. A toll-free hotline is also maintained to permit employees to report compliance concerns on an anonymous basis. 

Professional Liability 

As part of our business, our subsidiaries are subject to claims of liability for events occurring in the ordinary course of operations. To cover a portion of these claims, professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance are maintained in amounts which are commercially available and believed to be sufficient for operations as currently conducted, although some claims may exceed the scope or amount of the coverage in effect. 

The recorded liability for professional liability risks of our subsidiaries&#146; operations includes an estimate of liability for claims assumed at the acquisition and for claims incurred after the acquisition of healthcare businesses. These estimates are based on actuarially determined amounts. 

Environmental Regulation 

We believe our subsidiaries are in substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local environmental regulations. To date, compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of material into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment have not had a material effect upon our consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial condition or competitive position. Similarly, we have not had to make material capital expenditures to comply with such regulations. 

&#160;

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT 

Our executive officers, as of September 27, 2016, their positions with the Company or its subsidiaries and their ages are as follows: 

&#160;

Name 

&#160; Offices
