 ITEM 1. Business 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

Bovie Medical Corporation ("Company", "Bovie Medical", "we", "us", or "our") was incorporated in 1982, under the laws of the State of Delaware and has its principal executive office at 4 Manhattanville Road, Suite #106, Purchase, New York 10577. 

&#160;

We are an energy-based medical device company specializing in developing, manufacturing, and marketing a range of electrosurgical products and technologies, as well as related medical products used in doctor's offices, surgery centers and hospitals worldwide. Our medical devices are marketed through Bovie's own well-respected brands (Bovie &#210; , IDS &#8482; and ICON &#8482; ) and on a private label basis to distributors throughout the world. The Company also leverages its expertise in the design, development and manufacturing of electrosurgical equipment by producing equipment for large, well-known medical device manufacturers through original equipment manufacturing (OEM) agreements, as well as start-up companies with the need for our energy based designs. 

&#160;

We are also the developer of J-Plasma &#210; ; a patented helium-based plasma surgical product which we believe has the potential to be a transformational product for surgeons. J-Plasma &#210; has FDA clearance for the cutting, coagulation, and ablation of soft tissue. The J-Plasma &#210; system consists of an electrosurgical generator unit (ESU), a handpiece and a supply of helium gas. Radiofrequency (RF) energy is delivered to the handpiece by the ESU and used to energize an electrode. When helium gas is passed over the energized electrode, a helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the patient in the form of a precise helium plasma beam. The energy delivered to the patient via the helium plasma beam is very precise and cooler in temperature in comparison to other surgical energy modalities such as standard RF monopolar energy. While currently in the early stages of commercialization, J-Plasma has been the subject of ten white papers and has been cited therein for its clinical utility in gynecological and plastic surgery procedures. 

&#160;

&#160;

Industry 

&#160;

Healthcare reform has caused consolidation among providers, with hospitals merging, physician practices joining hospitals, and institutions combining to form Accountable Care Organizations, to manage patients on an interdisciplinary basis. Although the medical device industry can be challenging and very competitive, we believe it will continue to have a positive, long-term growth trajectory with the number of surgical procedures performed increasing annually as a result of the aging "baby boomer" population and other healthcare trends. Additionally, we also anticipate a continued increase in minimally invasive surgical procedures due to ongoing advancements in technology coupled with continued overall pressure to reduce healthcare costs via a reduction in patient trauma and recovery time. Expanding global markets will also continue to provide growth opportunities for the medical device industry. 

&#160;

We believe that Bovie Medical has sustainable, competitive advantages in the medical device market for several reasons. We have a long history in electrosurgery. In fact, our inspiration dates back to the first use of an electrosurgical generator in an operating room in the U.S. in 1926 where Dr. William T. Bovie was present. Thus, the Bovie name is recognized by surgeons the world over for having pioneered the electrosurgery field and is recognized for its outstanding product quality supported by strong engineering and research and development capabilities. This history equates to very strong recognition of the Bovie brand. In fact, the word "Bovie" has become synonymous with all instruments used to deliver electrosurgical energy in the operating room. We believe that our equipment and devices have and will continue to provide better experiences for patients at a lower cost to the healthcare system. 

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160;

Our objective is to achieve profitable, sustainable growth by increasing our market share in the advanced energy category, including the commercialization of products that have the potential to be transformational with respect to the results they produce for surgeons and patients. In order to achieve this objective, we plan to leverage our long history in the industry, along with the reputation for quality and reliability that the Bovie brand enjoys within the medical community. At the same time, we will expand our products beyond radio frequency, move forward with research and developments projects aimed at creating value within our existing product portfolio and build our pipeline of new complementary products and utilize multiple channels to bring new and existing products to market. 

&#160;

We are working to build our position in advanced electrosurgical generators and disposables, which can be used in diversified niche markets with minimally invasive surgical instruments, while furthering our status as a pioneer in plasma technology and its various medical applications. 

&#160;

Our J-Plasma product initially received FDA clearance in 2012, and a CE mark in December, 2014, which enables us to sell the product in Europe. In 2014, we brought together a new management team and created and trained a direct sales force dedicated to J-Plasma &#210; . In 2015, we continued the commercialization process for J-Plasma with a multi-faceted strategy designed to accelerate adoption of the product. This strategy primarily involved deployment of a dedicated sales force, extending and customizing the J-Plasma &#210; product line and expanding the surgical specialties in which J-Plasma &#210; can become the "standard of care" for certain procedures. &#160;

&#160; 5 

&#160; 

&#160; 

By the end of 2015, we had 13 field-based selling professionals and a network of 26 independent manufacturing representatives, resulting in a total sales force of 39. This is a hospital based selling organization with its focus on the use of J-Plasma for operating room procedures. 

&#160;

Additionally, we launched six new J-Plasma hand piece configurations and the Bovie Ultimate generator, which combines J-Plasma functionality with standard electrosurgery modes in one generator. The Bovie Ultimate was recognized by the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons (SLS) as an Innovative Product of the Year at their annual meeting in September 2015, following a similar recognition in 2014. As a result of our sales, marketing and product development initiatives in 2015, we have significantly increased the number of surgeons using the product, gained approvals for the sale of J-Plasma &#210; from Hospital Value Analysis Committees and signed agreements for the use of J-Plasma &#210; by the members of Group Purchasing Organizations that serve the medical community. 

&#160;

In order to assist us in leveraging J-Plasma's precision and effectiveness in multiple surgical specialties, we launched a Medical Advisory Board in 2015 currently comprised of surgeons who are recognized leaders in urology, cardiovascular and cardiothoracic surgery. 

&#160;

We are continuing to make substantial investments in the development and marketing of our J-Plasma technology for the long term benefit of the Company and its stakeholders and this may adversely affect our short term profitability and cash flow, particularly over the next 12 to 24 months. While we believe that these investments have the potential to generate additional revenues and profits in the future, there can be no assurance that J-Plasma will be successful or that such future revenues and profitability will be realized. From June of 2010 through December 31, 2014, we invested approximately $5.5 million in the development and marketing of our J-Plasma technology and an additional approximately $5.5 million in 2015, bringing the total investment to approximately $11.0 million since inception. 

&#160;

Company Products 

&#160;

We group our products into three main categories: electrosurgery, cauteries, and other products. Information regarding sales by product categories and related percentages can be found in our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. We manufacture and market various medical products, both under private label and the Bovie brands (Bovie, IDS, ICON and DERM), to distributors worldwide. Additionally, Bovie has original equipment manufacturing (OEM) agreements with other medical device manufacturers. These OEM and private label arrangements and our use of the Bovie brands enable us to gain greater market share for the distribution of our products. 

&#160;

Electrosurgery Products 

&#160;

Electrosurgery is our largest product line and includes desiccators, generators, electrodes, electrosurgical pencils and various ancillary disposable products. These electrosurgical products are used during surgical procedures in gynecology, urology, plastic surgery, dermatology, veterinary, and other surgical markets for the cutting and coagulation of tissue. It is estimated that 80% of all surgical procedures performed worldwide are conducted by electrosurgery. Our electrosurgery products fall under two categories, monopolar and bipolar. Monopolar products require the use of a grounding pad attached to the patient for the return of the electrical current, while bipolar products consist of two electrodes; one for the inbound current and one for the return current and therefore do not require the use of a grounding pad. &#160;

&#160; 6 

&#160; 

&#160; 

DERM 101 and DERM 102 

&#160;

These effective and economical 10 watt high frequency desiccators provide a low wattage platform for minor in-office skin procedures. We designed these products specifically for family practice physicians, pediatricians and other general practitioners, enabling them to perform simple skin procedures in their offices instead of referring the patient to a specialist saving the patient time and providing additional revenue generating procedures for the physician. 

&#160;

Aaron 940/ Aaron 950 / Aaron 1250U 

&#160;

The Aaron 940 is a Bovie developed, low powered 40-watt high frequency desiccator designed primarily for dermatology and family practice physicians. The units are used mainly for removing small skin lesions and growths as well as for coagulation for office based procedures. 

&#160;

The Aaron 950 is a 60-watt high frequency desiccator with the added feature of a cut capacity for outpatient surgical procedures. In effect, the 950 is two independent surgical devices in one small package. It is designed mainly for use in doctors' offices and is utilized in a broad range of specialties including dermatology, gynecology, family practice, urology, plastic surgery and ophthalmology. 

&#160;

The Aaron 1250U is a 120-watt multipurpose electrosurgery generator. The unit features monopolar and bipolar functions with pad sensing. This product is considered to be ideally suited for office-based procedures in the specialties of gynecology, plastic surgery and urology. 

&#160;

Aaron 2250 /2350/ 3250/3350 and IDS 200 /210/ 300 /310 400 

&#160;

To address market demand for more powerful electrosurgical generators, Bovie developed 200, 300 and 400-watt multipurpose digital electrosurgery generators designed for the rapidly expanding surgi-center market and the hospital outpatient and inpatient markets. This equipment includes digital hardware that enables very high parallel data processing throughout the operation or procedure. All data is sampled and processed digitally. For the first time in electrosurgery, surgeons are able to measure tissue impedance in real time (5,000 times a second) thanks to the utilization of digital technology. The design of these units is based on a digital feedback system. By using dedicated digital hardware in place of a general purpose controller for processing data, our equipment enables the power to be adjusted as the impedance varies, to deliver a consistent clinical effect. 

&#160;

The IDS 200/Aaron 2250 are 200-watt generators that have the capability to be used in the majority of procedures performed today in surgi-center or outpatient settings. Although 200 watts is adequate to do most procedures in the operating room, 300 watts is considered the standard and believed to be what most hospitals and surgi-centers will require. To meet this requirement, we developed the IDS 300/ Aaron 3250. 

&#160;

IDS 310/210 and Bovie OR|Pro A3350 and Surgicenter Pro A2350 are the next generation of surgi-center and operating room generators. These units incorporate the best features of the IDS 300 and upgrade its capabilities by providing additional bipolar options, including the 225-watt Bovie bipolar and an auto bipolar feature. The 300 watt units also offer the capability to utilize two pencils with simultaneous activation in fulguration mode. 

&#160;

The Bovie IDS 400 is a 400-watt generator designed primarily for sale in markets outside of the United States. These units feature both monopolar and bipolar functions, have pad and tissue sensing, and include nine blended cutting settings. &#160;

Electrosurgical Disposables 

&#160;

Resistick &#8482; II 

&#160;

Resistick II is a trademarked and proprietary coating that is applied to stainless steel that resist eschar (scab or scar tissue caused by burning) during surgery. We have experienced strong demand for this product since its introduction in 2011, and it represents our continued expansion of the Bovie line of electrosurgical disposables. 

&#160;

Disposable Laparoscopic Electrodes 

&#160;

We have introduced a line of disposable laparoscopic electrodes in Resistick coated and stainless steel for use by physicians from a broad group of specialties including gynecology, general surgery and urology. These electrodes are offered in J-hook, L-hook, needle, ball and spatula design and have an adapter included which makes these laparoscopic electrodes usable with a 3/32" or 4mm plug. 

&#160;

Cauteries 

&#160;

Battery Operated Cauteries 

&#160;

Battery operated cauteries constitute our second largest product line. Cauteries were originally designed for precise hemostasis (to stop bleeding) in ophthalmology. The current use of cauteries has been substantially expanded to include a broad range of applications. Battery operated cauteries are primarily sterile one-time use products. We have continued to improve our offering and now have a snap design cautery which has a patent pending . It features a switch mechanism that dramatically reduces the potential for accidental activation. We manufacture one of the broadest lines of cauteries in the world, including but not limited to, a line of replaceable battery and replaceable tip cauteries, which are popular in veterinary and overseas markets. 

&#160;

Other Products 

&#160;

Battery Operated Medical Lights 

&#160;

We manufacture and market a variety of specialty lighting instruments for use in ophthalmology as well as distribute specialty lighting instruments for general surgery, hip replacement surgery and for the placement of endotracheal tubes in emergency and surgical procedures. We also manufacture and market physicians' office use penlights used in physician offices. 

&#160;

Nerve Locator Stimulator 

&#160;

We manufacture a nerve locator stimulator primarily used for identifying motor nerves in hand and facial reconstructive surgery. This instrument is a sterile, self-contained, battery-operated unit, for one time use. &#160;

&#160; 

J-Plasma Products 

&#160;

ICON GS 

&#160;

Bovie's J-Plasma technology is the foundation for the ICON GS plasma system, which utilizes a helium ionization process producing a stable thin focused beam of ionized gas that can be controlled in a wide range of temperatures and intensities, providing the surgeon greater control and predictability with minimal thermal damage to surrounding tissue. The development of this helium plasma generator also includes the design of a new proprietary handpiece. 

&#160;

In March 2015, we launched The Bovie &#210; &#160; Ultimate&#8482; generator. The Bovie &#160; Ultimate is a high frequency electrosurgical generator that can be used for delivery of RF energy and/or helium gas plasma to cut, coagulate and ablate soft tissue during open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. The generator offers users monopolar, bipolar and J-Plasma features in a single generator. It has both FDA clearance and CE Mark. 

&#160;

J-Plasma Disposable Portfolio 

&#160;

We offer different hand pieces for open and laparoscopic procedures. The helium-based plasma generated from these devices have been shown to cause less thermal damage to tissue than CO 2 laser, argon plasma and RF energy products currently available on the market. The technology has a general indication and can be used for cutting, coagulating and ablating soft tissue. The two primary specialties that are targeted in phase one of the product launch are gynecology and plastic surgery. However, given the wide range of tissue applications for J-Plasma, we are now engaged in ongoing development to create products for urology, cardiovascular, and cardiothoracic procedures. The advantages of helium plasma continue to be studied throughout the medical and scientific communities. We believe that surgical applications are just one area of opportunity for this technology. 

&#160;

In September of 2015, we expanded our offering of laparoscopic hand pieces by introducing the J-Plasma Precise&#8482; configurations to the market. The six new J-Plasma Precise&#8482; configurations include three new lengths with either a blade or needle electrode with an ergonomic, pistol grip design. These new configurations expand the procedure base for J-Plasma by providing surgeons with the tools they need to access additional anatomic locations. 

&#160;

Research and Development and New Products 

&#160;

Our research and development activities are an essential component of our efforts to develop innovative products for introduction in the marketplace to drive sales growth. We continue to emphasize the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines. In 2015, we spent approximately $2,160,000 in R&#38;D versus approximately $1,416,000 during the same period of 2014, an increase of approximately 52.5%. Bovie products introduced to the market in 2015 as a result of our internal research and development opportunities include: The Bovie &#210; &#160; Ultimate&#8482; generator, J-Plasma Precise&#8482; hand pieces and multiple new electrosurgical generators for OEM customers. 

&#160;

Sales &#38; Marketing 

&#160;

The majority of our core products are marketed through medical distributors, which distribute to more than 6,000 hospitals and to doctors and other healthcare facilities. New distributors are contacted through responses to our advertising in international and domestic medical journals and our presence at domestic and international trade shows. International sales represented approximately 16.9% of total revenues in 2015, compared to approximately 15.8% in 2014. Management estimates our products have been sold in more than 150 countries through local dealers coordinated by sales and marketing personnel at our Clearwater, Florida facility. &#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

We compete with numerous manufacturers and distributors of medical supplies and devices, many of which are large and well-established. With the exception of J-Plasma and endoscopic instrumentation, which are sold directly to the end-user under our own brand, many of our products are private labeled. The majority of the products in our core business are sold through distributors under the Bovie or Aaron label. The balance is private labeled for major distributors who sell it under their own name. By having private labeled and branded distribution, we are able to increase our position in the marketplace and compete with much larger organizations. While our private label customers distribute products through their internal sales force, the majority of our products are sold through distributors which increases our sales potential and helps level the playing field relative to our large competitors that sell direct. Domestically, we continue to believe that we have a substantial market share in the field of electrosurgical generator manufacturing through our Bovie branded and OEM units. 

&#160;

Our main competitors in electrosurgical and accessory markets are Valleylab (a division of Covidien), Conmed and Erbe Electromedizine. In the battery operated cautery market, our main competitor is Beaver Visitec, and in the endoscopic instrumentation market, it is Ethicon (a division of Johnson and Johnson) and Covidien Surgical Solutions (formally U.S. Surgical, a division of Covidien). Currently, we are the only company with helium-based plasma and retractable blade products. However, there are argon plasma competitors, Conmed, and CO 2 laser competitors for our target market. We believe our competitive position did not change in 2015 . 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We rely on our intellectual property that we have developed or acquired over the years including patents, trade secrets, technical innovations, and various licensing agreements to provide our future growth and build our competitive position. We have been issued 30 patents in the United States and 18 foreign patents. We have 16 pending patent applications in the United States and 14 pending foreign applications. Our intellectual property portfolio for the technology and products related to J-Plasma product is included in these totals and continues to grow. Specific to J-Plasma, we have been issued 14 U.S. and 8 foreign patents, and we have 10 U.S. and 4 foreign applications pending. As we continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio we believe it is critical for us to continue to invest in filing patent applications to protect our technology, inventions, and improvements. However, we can give no assurance that competitors will not infringe on our patent rights or otherwise create similar or non-infringing competing products that are technically patentable in their own right. 

&#160;

Manufacturing and Suppliers 

&#160;

We are committed to producing the most technically advanced and highest quality products of their kind available on the market. We manufacture the majority of our products on our premises in Clearwater, Florida and at our facility located in Sofia, Bulgaria, which are certified under the ISO international quality standards and are subject to continuing regulation and routine inspections by the FDA to ensure compliance with regulations relating to our quality system, medical device complaint reporting, and adherence to FDA restrictions on promotion and advertising. In addition, we are subject to regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act and other federal, state and local regulations. 

&#160;

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Bovie Bulgaria, EOOD. Bovie Bulgaria operates a 16,000 square foot ISO13485 certified and FDA registered manufacturing facility located in the capital city of Sofia, which houses manufacturing, development and assembly operations. 

&#160;

We also have collaborative arrangements with three foreign suppliers under which we request the development of certain items and components, which we purchase pursuant to purchase orders. Our purchase order commitments are never more than one year in duration and are supported by our sales forecasts. &#160;

&#160; 10 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160;

We sell the majority of our current products through major distributors which include Cardinal Health, Independent Medical Co-Op Inc. (IMCO), McKesson Medical Surgical, Inc., Medline, National Distribution and Contracting Inc. (NDC), and Owens &#38; Minor and have manufacturing agreements for private label of certain products with these and others. 

&#160;

In 2015, we signed long-term agreements with three group purchasing organizations (GPO). We believe that partnering with GPO's is critical to our sales efforts and J-Plasma commercialization efforts. 

&#160;

Backlog 

&#160;

The value of unshipped factory orders is not material. 

&#160;
