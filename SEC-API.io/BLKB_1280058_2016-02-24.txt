 Item 1. Business 

Description of Business 

We are a leading provider of software and services for the global philanthropic community. Our customers use our cloud-based and on-premises software solutions and related services to help increase donations, reduce fundraising costs, improve communications with constituents, manage their finances and optimize operations. Since our incorporation as a New York corporation in 1981, we have been dedicated to developing software and services that help this industry grow and operate more efficiently. Our solutions are designed to meet the needs of nonprofits, foundations and other charitable giving organizations, and academic institutions - from large, multi-national organizations to small, emerging entities. We reincorporated as a South Carolina corporation in 1991 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2004. With recent acquisitions, we have expanded our addressable market to include institutions involved with the entire spectrum of giving activities, such as nonprofits, K-12 private and higher education institutions, healthcare organizations, foundations and other charitable giving entities and corporations. Using Blackbaud technology, these organizations raise, invest, manage and award more than $100 billion each year. At the end of 2015 , we had approximately 35,000 &#32;active customers located in over 60 &#32;countries using our solutions. Our customers serve as a constant source of inspiration to us, and we are extremely proud to play a part in their success. 

Market Overview 

The philanthropic industry is significant and our addressable market is substantial and growing 

There were approximately 1.7 million U.S. nonprofit organizations registered with the Internal Revenue Service in 2014, including approximately 1.1 million charitable 501(c)(3) organizations reported in 2014. We estimate there are over 3 million charities internationally outside the U.S. The nonprofit market represents the third largest workforce category in the U.S. behind retail and manufacturing. Nonprofit organizations receive fees for services they provide, which are estimated at more than $1.5 trillion annually with nonprofit expenses also amounting to more than $1.5 trillion. According to Giving USA 2015, donations to U.S. nonprofit organizations in 2014 were $358.4 billion, amounting to 2.1% of U.S. GDP, a 7.1% increase from 2013. The average annual rate of change in total giving dollars over the last 40 years was 6.8%. 

Our estimated current total addressable market ("TAM") is $6.3 billion. This includes an expansion in 2015 from our acquisition of Smart, LLC ("Smart Tuition") into K-12 tuition and financial aid management; a new and near adjacency within the education market. The total market expansion created by our recent acquisitions of Smart Tuition, WhippleHill Communications, Inc. (&#8220;WhippleHill&#8221;) and MicroEdge Holdings, LLC (&#8220;MicroEdge&#8221;) is estimated to be in excess of $1.5 billion. 

Traditional methods of fundraising are often costly and inefficient 

Many nonprofits use manual methods or stand-alone software applications not specifically designed to manage fundraising. Such methods are often costly and inefficient because of the difficulties in effectively collecting, sharing, and using donation-related information. Furthermore, general purpose software applications frequently have limited functionality and do not efficiently integrate multiple databases. Some nonprofit organizations have developed proprietary software, but doing so is expensive, requiring on-site technical personnel for development, implementation and maintenance. 

The nonprofit industry faces particular operational challenges 

Nonprofit organizations must efficiently: 

&#8226; 

Solicit funds and build relationships with major donors; 

&#8226; 

Garner small cash contributions from numerous contributors; 

&#8226; 

Manage and develop complex relationships with large numbers of constituents; 

&#8226; 

Communicate their accomplishments and the importance of their mission online and offline; 

&#8226; 

Comply with complex accounting, tax and reporting requirements that differ from those for traditional businesses; 

&#8226; 

Solicit cash and in-kind contributions from businesses to help raise money or deliver products and services; 

&#8226; 

Provide a wide array of programs and services to individual constituents; and 

2015 Form 10-K 

Blackbaud, Inc. 

&#8226; 

Improve the data collection and information sharing capabilities of their employees, volunteers and donors by creating and providing distributed access to centralized databases. 

Because of these challenges, we believe nonprofit organizations can benefit from software applications and services specifically designed to serve their particular needs. 

Corporations, grant making institutions and foundations also face unique challenges 

The market segments addressed by our MicroEdge acquisition, which include corporations, grant making institutions and foundations, face their own unique challenges, including the need to: 

&#8226; 

Quantify and improve the impact of their grants; 

&#8226; 

Cultivate better relationships with grantees; 

&#8226; 

Achieve better internal collaboration and alignment with board members, reviewers, and other stakeholders; 

&#8226; 

Illustrate the impact of their corporate philanthropy efforts to the communities they serve; 

&#8226; 

Engage employees in meaningful volunteering, giving and other activities; 

&#8226; 

Ensure that their philanthropic efforts align with their business initiatives; 

&#8226; 

Manage all of a foundation's activities, including fundraising and accounting; 

&#8226; 

Expand the reach of their fundraising efforts; and 

&#8226; 

Cultivate new and existing donors. 

Strategy 

Our objective is to maintain and extend our position as a leading provider of software and services for the global philanthropic community, supporting their missions from fundraising to outcomes. Our key strategies for achieving this objective are to: 

Delight our customers 

We intend to make our customers' experience with us effective, efficient and satisfying from their initial interest in our solutions and services, through their decision to purchase, engage with customer support and utilize solution enhancements. We continue to focus on initiatives aimed at improving the consistency and quality of user experience across the offerings we provide to our customers. We continue to evolve the manner in which we package and sell our offerings to provide high quality and value combined with flexibility to meet the different needs of our existing and prospective customers. For example, we are increasing the number of our cloud-based solutions sold under a subscription pricing model, which can make it easier for customers to purchase our solutions. In addition, we are continuing to integrate value-adding capabilities such as payment processing, analytics and business intelligence into our suite of solutions to better address our customers' needs with comprehensive offerings. We will continue to focus on providing the highest level of solution support, enhancing our existing solutions and developing new solutions and services designed to help our customers to be more effective and achieve their missions. 

Execute on our Five Point Growth Strategy 

During 2014, we introduced and began executing on a five point growth strategy. In 2015, these strategies evolved to account for progress to date and future outlook and are as follows: 

1. 

Integrated and Open Solutions in the Cloud 

We will continue to transition our business to predominantly serve customers through a subscription-based cloud delivery model, enabling lower cost of entry, greater scalability and lower total cost of ownership to our customers. There is a concerted effort underway to optimize our portfolio of solutions and integrate powerful capabilities &#8212; such as built in data, analytics, payment processing and tailored user-specific experiences &#8212; to bring even greater value and performance to our customers. In 2015, we announced the general availability of Raiser's Edge NXT&#8482;, Financial Edge NXT&#8482;, and we introduced Blackbaud SKY&#8482;, which is our new, innovative cloud technology architecture for the global philanthropic community. 

2. 

Drive Sales Effectiveness 

We are making investments to increase the effectiveness of our sales organization, to expand our direct sales and customer success teams and to introduce indirect sales with the announcement of a value added reseller ("VAR") program, launching in the first quarter of 2016. 

2015 Form 10-K 

Blackbaud, Inc. 

3. 

Expand TAM into Near Adjacencies with Acquisitions 

We will continue to evaluate compelling opportunities to acquire companies, technologies and/or services. We will be guided by our acquisition criteria for considering attractive assets, which expand our total addressable market, provide entry into new and near adjacencies, accelerate our shift to the cloud, accelerate revenue growth, are accretive to margins and present synergistic opportunities. 

4. 

Streamline Operations 

We have largely completed the installations of single best-in-breed back-office solutions to standardize operations utilizing scalable tools and systems. Our focus is now shifting towards optimizing those systems, as well as operational excellence and quality initiatives focused on streamlining processes to gain efficiency and scalability. 

5. 

Execute our 3-Year Margin Improvement Plan 

In 2014, we implemented a 3-year operating margin improvement plan designed to increase our operating effectiveness and efficiency and improve non-GAAP operating margins 300 to 600 basis points on a constant currency basis from our 2014 baseline of 17.5%, by the time we exit 2017. 

Attract Top Talent and Actively Engage Employee Base 

Our customer's passion is our purpose, and we have incredible customers whose missions make the world a better place for all of us. Driven by this purpose, our employees come to work every day knowing they can make a real difference with our customers, and thus the world. Collaboration, innovation and high standards are core to our culture and help enable the great work we do. We strive to hire the best employees and provide a workplace where their talents and potential are realized. Our employees' engagement is a focus of every leader at Blackbaud, and we continually work to understand what matters and to make our workplace better. We believe people with a passion for purpose can join our team and have a unique career experience. Our leaders are committed to our employees' personal and career development and continually work to improve the training and tools provided to their teams. 

Build our Reputation as an Industry Thought Leader 

In our nearly 35 years of experience in the philanthropic market, we have gained significant insight into the market and industry segments in which we operate. We produce a wide range of thought leadership materials, including blogs, monthly indices and white papers, which provide insights and guidance to the philanthropic community. We also participate in a number of industry forums where we exchange views and engage with industry and governmental leaders. Our annual user conference, bbcon &#8482;, is used in part as a forum to offer thought leadership to our customers, as well as other market specific user conferences such as our annual K-12 conference. We intend to expand these activities and further build our reputation as a thought leader within the industry. 

Operating Structure 

The markets we serve are very diverse, with organizations that range from small, local charities to large, multinational relief organizations. The needs of our customers can vary greatly according to their size and function. To better serve our customers' unique and wide-ranging operations, we organize our operating structure into three operating units: the General Markets Business Unit (the &#8220;GMBU&#8221;), the Enterprise Customer Business Unit (the &#8220;ECBU&#8221;) and the International Business Unit (the &#8220;IBU&#8221;). 

Following is a description of each of our operating units, each of which is a reportable segment for financial accounting purposes: 

&#8226; 

The GMBU is focused on marketing, sales, delivery and support to all emerging and mid-sized prospects and customers in North America. 

&#8226; 

The ECBU is focused on marketing, sales, delivery and support to large and/or strategic prospects and customers in North America. 

&#8226; 

The IBU is focused on marketing, sales, delivery and support to all prospects and customers outside of North America. 

Each operating unit contains specialized sales, services, support, marketing and finance functions. We believe this structure allows us to be more responsive to the needs of fundamentally different customer segments and to focus on developing solutions appropriate for these unique markets while leveraging the infrastructure of our broader organization and shared 

2015 Form 10-K 

Blackbaud, Inc. 

technology in a cost-effective manner. It also allows us to develop highly customized approaches to marketing and selling our solutions in the markets we serve. 

During 2015 , we generated revenue in three reportable segments (the GMBU, the ECBU and the IBU) and in four geographic regions (United States, Canada, Europe and Australia), as described in more detail in Note 16 &#32;of our consolidated financial statements. It is impracticable for us to identify our total assets by segment. Summarized below is our percentage of total revenue for each of our principal solution and service groups:

Blackbaud's portfolio of software and services support nonprofit fundraising and relationship management, digital marketing, advocacy, accounting, payments and analytics, as well as grant management, corporate social responsibility ("CSR"), and education. We offer the global philanthropic community a complete system to meet any need with the market-leading constituent relationship management ("CRM") system and online engagement platforms, backed by our analytic services that we are leveraging to make our software "smarter." In most cases, the core of our solution portfolio centers around a CRM system, which seamlessly integrates with other applications to help our customers conduct activities vital to advancing their missions, such as managing finances, analyzing prospects and market data, effectively communicating with current and prospective supporters and promoting their cause online and offline.

In addition, we offer solutions that stretch across the spectrum of giving activities, including CSR programs, grant management, employee involvement, foundation management and other philanthropic activities.

Sales and Marketing 

The majority of our solutions and related services are sold through our direct sales force. Our direct sales force is complemented by a team of account development representatives responsible for sales lead generation and qualification. These sales and marketing professionals are located throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. As of December 31, 2015 , we had 376 &#32;direct sales employees. We plan to continue expanding our direct sales force in the Americas, Europe, Australia and New Zealand as our operations grow internationally and market demand increases. 

We generally begin a customer relationship with the sale of one of our primary solutions or services, such as Raiser's Edge NXT, Blackbaud CRM or Luminate, and then offer additional solutions and services to the customer as the organization's needs increase. As our business model evolves, we are increasingly beginning customer relationships with the sale of an integrated suite of cloud-based solutions. 

We conduct marketing programs to create brand recognition and market awareness for our solutions and services. Our marketing efforts include participation at tradeshows, technical conferences and technology seminars, publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals and preparation of competitive analyses. Our customers and strategic partners provide references and recommendations that we often feature in our advertising and promotional activities. 

We believe relationships with third parties can enhance our sales and marketing efforts. We have and will continue to establish additional relationships with companies that provide services to the nonprofit industry, such as consultants, educators, publishers, financial service providers, complementary technology providers and data providers. These companies promote or complement our nonprofit solutions and provide us access to new customers.

Blackbaud, Inc. 

Corporate Philanthropy and Volunteerism 

Blackbaud operates under a fundamental belief that the world would be better if good took over. The company is an active participant in the ecosystem of good, working to drive positive change both through what we do as a business and how we serve individually. We offer an array of philanthropy programs aimed at engaging our employees as agents of good, including matching gifts, competitive grants that honor excellent examples of volunteerism, employee-led grants committees, skills-based volunteerism initiatives, as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics focused community programs. Blackbaud attracts people who are committed to service, with 84% saying our focus on nonprofits was a driver in their decision to join the company and 81% actively serving as volunteers. More than 100 nonprofits have Blackbaud employees on their boards. 

Competition 

The market for software and related services in the nonprofit sector is competitive and highly fragmented. For certain areas of the market, entry barriers are low. However, we believe our experience and full spectrum of solutions makes us a strong competitor. We expect to continue to see new competitors as the market matures and as nonprofit organizations become more aware of the advantages and efficiencies attainable through the use of specialized software. 

We compete with several software developers that provide specialized products, such as on-demand software specifically designed for nonprofit organizations, charitable giving and educational organizations. In addition, we compete with custom-developed solutions created either internally by nonprofit organizations or outside by custom service providers. We believe that we compete successfully, because building efficient, highly functional custom solutions equal to ours may require technical resources that might not be available within nonprofit organizations or might not be readily available to certain custom solution providers. In addition, the nonprofit organization's legacy database and software system may not have been designed to support the increasingly complex and advanced needs of today's growing community of nonprofit organizations. 

We also compete with providers of traditional, less automated fundraising service providers, including parties providing services in support of traditional direct mail or email campaigns, special events fundraising, peer to peer, telemarketing and personal solicitations. We believe we compete successfully against these traditional fundraising service providers, primarily because our solutions and services are more automated, more robust, more tailored to the needs of nonprofit organization and more efficient. 

In the independent, family and community foundation markets, we encounter competition primarily from smaller companies with products that range from simple grantmaking solutions to custom developed platforms. The competition we face in the corporate giving/grantmaking and employee volunteering markets comes primarily from three sources: providers of end-to-end solutions that combine grant making and CSR functionality; providers of standalone CSR software; and providers of grants management software. 

Larger companies that compete with us, such as Microsoft, Salesforce.com and Oracle, have greater marketing resources, revenue and market recognition than we do. They offer some products that are designed specifically for nonprofit organizations, in addition to some of their general products, which have a degree of functionality for nonprofit organizations that could be considered competitive. These larger companies could decide to focus more on the nonprofit sector with new, directly competitive products or through acquisitions of our current competitors. 

Research and Development 

We have made substantial investments in research and development and expect to continue to do so as a part of our strategy to introduce additional innovative solutions and services.

Our research and development expenses for 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;were $84.6 million , $77.2 million &#32;and $65.6 million , respectively, and our cash outlays for software development costs for 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;were $15.5 million , $8.5 million &#32;and $3.2 million , respectively.

Technology and Architecture 

Our new cloud technology, SKY, combines software defined infrastructure, leading edge development processes, and a micro service oriented architecture to deliver our next generation solutions, the first of which were Raiser's Edge NXT and Financial Edge NXT. Another component of SKY, SKY API, gives customers, partners and other application developers access to industry-standard, open, Representational State Transfer (or REST) APIs and a comprehensive set of resources that enable them to customize, integrate or extend functionality of our solutions. Additionally SKY UX, our open source user experience framework, increases the reach of our solutions by enabling developers to create interfaces that look and feel like ours by using the same user experience foundation as our engineers. 

Other solutions, such as Blackbaud CRM, are built on the Microsoft.Net framework platform. These solutions are web-delivered applications utilizing an architecture built on internet standards and protocols such as HTTP, XML and SOAP. This architecture is designed to support on-premises and hosted application deployment scenarios. The applications expose web service application programming interfaces so that functionality and business logic can be accessed programmatically from outside the context of an interactive user application. 

Each of our Luminate solutions, including Luminate Online, Luminate CRM and TeamRaiser, are cloud-based applications that are open and extensible and employ a multi-tenant architecture requiring only a web browser for customer access. Luminate Online and TeamRaiser share a common codebase and database, and are built on the Java runtime environment. Luminate CRM is built on the SalesForce.com platform. 

Our version 7.x generation solutions (e.g. Raiser's Edge) utilize a three-tier customer server architecture built on the Microsoft Component Object Model, or COM. 

Regardless of solution choice, our development strategies are designed to be: 

&#8226; 

Flexible. &#32;Our component-based architecture is programmable and easily customized by our customers without requiring modification of the source code, ensuring that the technology can be extended to accommodate changing demands of our customers and the market. 

&#8226; 

Adaptable. &#32;The architecture of our applications allows us to easily add features and functionality or to integrate with third-party applications in order to adapt to our customers' needs or market demands. 

&#8226; 

Scalable. &#32;We combine a scalable architecture with the performance, capacity and load balancing of industry-standard web servers and databases used by our customers to ensure that the applications can scale to the needs of larger organizations. 

We will continue to license technologies from third parties that are integrated into certain of our solutions. 

Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights 

To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws in various jurisdictions, as well as employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality procedures. We have a number of registered trademarks, including &#8220;Blackbaud,&#8221; &#8220;Raiser's Edge NXT&#8221; and &#8220;Luminate.&#8221; We have applied for additional trademarks. We currently have two active patents on our technology, and have a total of three pending patent applications. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 3,095 &#32;employees, none of which are represented by unions or are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We are not involved in any material disputes with any of our employees, and we believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory.
