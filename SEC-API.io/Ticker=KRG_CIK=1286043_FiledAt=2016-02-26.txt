&#160; 

Unless the context suggests otherwise, references to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221; refer to Kite Realty Group Trust and our business and operations conducted through our directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries, including Kite Realty Group, L.P., our operating partnership (the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;). 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Kite Realty Group Trust, a publicly-held real estate investment trust, through its majority-owned subsidiary, Kite Realty Group, L.P., owns interests in various operating subsidiaries and joint ventures engaged in the ownership, operation, acquisition, development, and redevelopment of high-quality neighborhood and community shopping centers in selected markets in the United States. We derive revenues primarily from rents and reimbursement payments received from tenants under leases at our properties. Our operating results therefore depend materially on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments, conditions in the United States retail sector and overall economic and real estate market conditions. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned interests in 110 &#32;retail operating properties totaling approximately 22.0 million &#32;square feet of gross leasable area (including approximately 6.7 million &#32;square feet of non-owned anchor space) located in 20 &#32;states. Our retail operating portfolio was 95.4% &#32;leased to a diversified retail tenant base, with no single retail tenant accounting for more than 3.4% &#32;of our total annualized base rent. In the aggregate, our largest 25 tenants accounted for 36.4% &#32;of our annualized base rent. See Item 2, &#8220;Properties&#8221; for a list of our top 25 tenants by annualized base rent. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had an interest in three development projects under construction. Upon completion, these projects are anticipated to have approximately 0.6 million &#32;square feet of gross leasable area. In addition to our development projects, as of December 31, 2015 , we had six redevelopment projects, which are expected to contain 1.2 million &#32;square feet of gross leasable area upon completion. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Significant 2015 Activities 

&#160; 

Operating Activities 

&#160; 

We continued to drive strong operating results from our portfolio as follows: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Same Property Net Operating Income ("Same Property NOI") increased 3.5% &#32;in 2015 &#32;compared to 2014 &#32;primarily due to increases in rental rates, and improved expense control and expense recoveries; 

&#8226; 

We executed leases on 188 &#32;new and 181 &#32;renewal individual spaces for approximately 2.1 million &#32;square feet of retail space in 2015 , which are both records for the Company; and 

&#8226; 

Continued to maintain our operational excellence. We believe our efficiency metrics, which we define as a combination of operating margin and general and administrative expenses to revenue, are in the top third of our peer group. 

Portfolio Recycling and Acquisition Activities 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In March 2015, we sold seven retail operating properties for aggregate gross proceeds of $167.4 million and a net gain of $3.4 million. In addition, in December 2015, we sold two properties for gross proceeds of $44.9 million &#32;and a net gain of $0.6 million . 

&#160; 

During 2015, we acquired four operating properties with total gross leasable area ("GLA") of approximately 928,000 square feet (617,000 square feet of owned GLA) for an aggregate purchase price of $185.8 million, including the following: 

&#8226; 

Colleyville Downs &#32;&#8211; In April 2015, we acquired this shopping center with total GLA of 200,900 square feet (185,800 square feet of owned GLA) in Dallas, Texas. Primary anchor tenants for this center include Whole Foods Market, Ace Hardware, and Petco. 

&#8226; 

Belle Isle Station &#32;&#8211; In May 2015, we acquired this shopping center with total GLA of 396,400 square feet (164,300 square feet of owned GLA) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Anchor tenants for this center include Nordstrom Rack, Old Navy, Ross Dress for Less, Shoe Carnival, Babies &#8216;R Us, Party City, Kirkland&#8217;s and a non-owned Wal-Mart Supercenter. 

&#8226; 

Livingston Shopping Center &#32;&#8211; In July 2015, we acquired this shopping center with total and owned GLA of 139,700 square feet in Livingston, New Jersey. Anchor tenants for this center include Nordstrom Rack, TJ Maxx, Cost Plus World Market, Buy Buy Baby, DSW and Ulta. 

&#8226; 

Chapel Hill Shopping Center &#32;&#8211; In August 2015, we acquired this shopping center with total GLA of 191,200 square feet (126,800 square feet of owned GLA) in Fort Worth, Texas. In connection with the acquisition, we assumed an $18.3 million fixed rate mortgage. Anchor tenants for this center include HEB Grocery, The Container Store and Cost Plus World Market. 

Development and Redevelopment Activities 

&#160; 

&#160; 

During 2015, we initiated, advanced, and completed a number of development and redevelopment activities, including the following: 

&#8226; 

Parkside Town Commons &#8211; Phase II &#32;near Raleigh, North Carolina &#8211; &#32;We commenced construction on Phase II of this development with total GLA of 347,800 square feet (297,400 square feet of owned GLA) in the second quarter of 2014. Field &#38; Stream and Golf Galaxy both opened in 2014 and Frank Theatres opened in July of 2015. The property is expected to be stabilized in the second half of 2016. 

&#8226; 

Holly Springs Towne Center &#8211; Phase II &#32;near Raleigh, North Carolina &#8211; We commenced construction on Phase II of this development with total GLA of 154,000 square feet (122,000 square feet of owned GLA) in the third quarter of 2014. Phase II of the development is anchored by Bed Bath &#38; Beyond, which opened in December 2015, and DSW, which is expected to open in the first half of 2016. The remaining anchor, Carmike Theatres, is expected to open in the summer of 2016. 

&#8226; 

Tamiami Crossing &#32;in Naples, Florida &#8211; &#32;We commenced site work on this development with total GLA of 141,600 square feet (121,600 square feet of owned GLA) in the fourth quarter of 2014. The development is expected to be stabilized by the second half of 2016. This center will be anchored by Stein Mart, Ulta, Michaels, Marshalls, Ross Dress for Less and Petsmart. 

&#8226; 

Gainesville Plaza &#32;in Gainesville, Florida &#8211; We substantially completed construction on this redevelopment and transitioned this project to the operating portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2015. This center is anchored by Burlington Coat Factory and Ross Dress for Less. 

&#8226; 

Cool Spring Market &#32;in Nashville, Tennessee &#8211; We completed the relocation of an existing Staples to a new, smaller space and executed new leases with Buy Buy Baby and DSW on this redevelopment. We transitioned this project to the operating portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Financing and Capital Raising Activities. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our primary business objectives are to generate increasing cash flow, achieve long-term growth and maximize shareholder value primarily through the operation, acquisition, development and redevelopment of well-located community and neighborhood shopping centers. In 2015 , we were able to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our financial flexibility and liquidity to fund future growth. We ended the year with approximately $373 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity on our unsecured revolving credit facility. Significant financing and capital raising activities included: 

&#8226; 

In June 2015, we increased the existing unsecured term loan with a maturity date of July 1, 2019 from $230 million &#32;to $400 million . 

&#8226; 

In September 2015, the Operating Partnership issued $250 million &#32;of senior unsecured notes at a blended rate of 4.41% &#32;and an average maturity of 9.8 years . 

&#8226; 

In October 2015, we entered into a new seven-year unsecured term loan ("7-Year Term Loan") for up to $200 million . In December 2015, we retired the $90 million loan that was secured by City Center utilizing a draw on our unsecured revolving credit facility. Later in December 2015, we drew $100 million on the term loan and used the proceeds to pay down the unsecured revolving credit facility. 

&#8226; 

In December 2015, we redeemed all 4,100,000 outstanding shares of our 8.250% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Share (&#8220;Series A Preferred Shares&#8221;). 

&#8226; 

During 2015, we retired $233.1 million &#32;of property level secured debt. 

&#160; 

2015 &#32;Cash Distributions 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In 2015 , we declared total cash distributions of $1.09 per common share and $2.0912 per share of our Series A Preferred Shares. The cash distribution per share of our Series A Preferred Shares includes the amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends up to, but not including, the redemption date of December 2, 2015. On February 4, 2016, our Board of Trustees approved a quarterly common share distribution of $0.2875 per common share for the first quarter of 2016, which represents a 5.5% &#32;increase over our previous quarterly distribution. 

Business Objectives and Strategies 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our primary business objectives are to increase the cash flow and build or realize capital appreciation of our properties, achieve sustainable long-term growth and maximize shareholder value primarily through the operation, acquisition, development, and redevelopment of well-located community and neighborhood shopping centers. We invest in properties with well-located real estate and strong demographics and we use our effective leasing and management strategies to improve the long-term values and economic returns of our properties. We believe that many of our properties represent opportunities for future renovation and expansion. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We seek to implement our business objectives through the following strategies, each of which is more completely described in the sections that follow: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Operating Strategy : Maximizing the internal growth in revenue from our operating properties by leasing and re-leasing those properties to a diverse group of retail tenants at increasing rental rates, when possible , &#32;and redeveloping or renovating certain properties to make them more attractive to existing and prospective tenants and consumers; 

&#8226; 

Growth Strategy : Using debt and equity capital prudently to selectively &#160; acquire additional retail properties, redevelop or renovate our existing properties, and develop shopping centers on land parcels that we currently 

own or newly acquired land where we believe that investment returns would meet or exceed internal benchmarks; and 

&#8226; 

Financing and Capital Preservation Strategy : Maintaining a strong balance sheet with sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investment activities. Funding sources include the public equity and debt market, our existing revolving credit facility, new secured debt, internally generated funds, proceeds from selling land and properties that no longer fit our strategy, and potential strategic joint ventures. We continuously monitor the capital markets and may consider raising additional capital when appropriate. 

Operating Strategy. &#32;Our primary operating strategy is to maximize rental rates and occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse tenant base. Most of our properties are located in regional and neighborhood trade areas with attractive demographics, which allows us to maintain and, in many cases, increase occupancy and rental rates. We seek to implement our operating strategy by, among other things: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

increasing rental rates upon the renewal of expiring leases or re-leasing space to new tenants while minimizing vacancy to the extent possible; 

&#8226; 

maximizing the occupancy of our operating portfolio; 

&#8226; 

minimizing tenant turnover; 

&#8226; 

maintaining leasing and property management strategies that maximize rent growth and cost recovery; 

&#8226; 

maintaining a diverse tenant mix in an effort to limit our exposure to the financial condition of any one tenant or any category of tenants; 

&#8226; 

maintaining the physical appearance, condition, and design of our properties and other improvements located on our properties to maximize our ability to attract customers; 

&#8226; 

actively managing costs to minimize overhead and operating costs; 

&#8226; 

maintaining strong tenant and retailer relationships in order to avoid rent interruptions and reduce marketing, leasing and tenant improvement costs that result from re-tenanting space; and 

&#8226; 

taking advantage of under-utilized land or existing square footage, reconfiguring properties for better use, or adding ancillary income areas to existing facilities. 

We successfully executed our operating strategy in 2015 &#32;in a number of ways, including improving our Same Property NOI by 3.5% &#32;and generating blended new and renewal positive cash leasing spreads of 11.4% in 2015 . We have also been successful in maintaining a diverse retail tenant mix with no tenant accounting for more than 3.4% &#32;of our annualized base rent. See Item 2, &#8220;Properties&#8221; for a list of our top tenants by gross leasable area and annualized base rent. 

Growth Strategy. &#32;Our growth strategy includes the selective deployment of resources to projects that are expected to generate investment returns that meet or exceed our internal benchmarks. We continue to implement our growth strategy in a number of ways, including: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

selectively pursuing the acquisition of retail operating properties, portfolios and companies in markets with strong demographics; 

&#8226; 

continually evaluating our operating properties for redevelopment and renovation opportunities that we believe will make them more attractive for leasing to new tenants, right sizing anchor space while increasing rental rates, or re-leasing to existing tenants at increased rental rates; and 

&#8226; 

disposing of selected assets that no longer meet our long-term investment criteria and recycling the net proceeds into assets that provide maximum returns and rent growth potential in targeted markets or using the proceeds to improve our financial position. 

In evaluating opportunities for potential acquisition, development, redevelopment and disposition, we consider a number of factors, including: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

the expected returns and related risks associated with the investments relative to our combined cost of capital to make such investments; 

&#8226; 

the current and projected cash flow and market value of the property and the potential to increase cash flow and market value if the property were to be successfully re-leased or redeveloped; 

&#8226; 

the price being offered for the property, the current and projected operating performance of the property, the tax consequences of the sale, and other related factors; 

&#8226; 

the current tenant mix at the property and the potential future tenant mix that the demographics of the property could support, including the presence of one or more additional anchors (for example, value retailers, grocers, soft goods stores, office supply stores, or sporting goods retailers), as well as an overall diverse tenant mix that includes restaurants, shoe and clothing retailers, specialty shops and service retailers such as banks, dry cleaners and hair salons, some of which provide staple goods to the community and offer a high level of convenience; 

&#8226; 

the configuration of the property, including ease of access, availability of parking, visibility, and the demographics of the surrounding area; and 

&#8226; 

the level of success of existing properties in the same or nearby markets. 

In 2015 , we were successful in completing and integrating the acquisition of four high-quality retail properties that enabled us to expand our presence in our core markets. We also delivered three very strong development and redevelopment projects to the operating portfolio, and we expect to deliver several more projects in 2016. In addition, we are currently evaluating &#32; additional redevelopment, repositioning, and repurposing opportunities at a number of operating properties. Total estimated costs for these projects are expected to be in the range of $130 million &#32;to $145 million . 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Financing and Capital Preservation Strategy. &#32;We finance our acquisition, development, and redevelopment activities seeking to use the most advantageous sources of capital available to us at the time. These sources may include the sale of common or preferred shares through public offerings or private placements, the reinvestment of proceeds from the disposition of assets, the incurrence of additional indebtedness through secured or unsecured borrowings, and entering into real estate joint ventures. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our primary financing and capital preservation strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and enhance our flexibility to fund operating and investment activities in the most cost-effective way. We consider a number of factors when evaluating our level and type of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding additional borrowings. Among these factors are the construction costs or purchase prices of properties to be developed or acquired, the estimated market value of our properties and the Company as a whole upon consummation of the financing, and the ability of particular properties to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet are important. We achieved an investment grade credit rating in 2014. We expect that will enable us to opportunistically access the public unsecured bond market at some point and otherwise will allow us to lower our cost of capital and provide greater flexibility in managing the acquisition and disposition of assets in our operating portfolio. In addition, through the retirement of property level secured debt in 2015, we were able to unencumber approximately $440 million of gross assets associated with our operating properties. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We intend to continue implementing our financing and capital strategies in a number of ways, including: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

prudently managing our balance sheet, including maintaining sufficient capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility so that we have additional capacity available to fund our development and redevelopment projects and pay down maturing debt if refinancing that debt is not feasible; 

&#8226; 

extending the maturity dates of and/or refinancing our near-term mortgage, construction and other indebtedness; 

&#8226; 

expanding our unencumbered asset pool; 

&#8226; 

raising additional capital through the issuance of common shares, preferred shares or other securities; 

&#8226; 

evaluating whether to enter into construction loans prior to commencement of vertical construction to fund our larger developments and redevelopments; 

&#8226; 

managing our exposure to interest rate increases on our variable-rate debt through the use of fixed rate hedging transactions; 

&#8226; 

issuing unsecured bonds in the public markets, and securing property specific long-term non-recourse financing; and 

&#8226; 

entering into joint venture arrangements in order to access less expensive capital and to mitigate risk. 

Competition 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The United States commercial real estate market continues to be highly competitive. We face competition from other REITs and other owner-operators engaged in the ownership, leasing, acquisition, and development of shopping centers as well as from numerous local, regional and national real estate developers and owners in each of our markets. Some of these competitors may have greater capital resources than we do; although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We face significant competition in our efforts to lease available space to prospective tenants at our operating, development and redevelopment properties. The nature of the competition for tenants varies based on the characteristics of each local market in which we own properties. We believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting tenants in our market areas are location, demographics, rental rates, the presence of anchor stores, competitor shopping centers in the same geographic area and the maintenance, appearance, access and traffic patterns of our properties. There can be no assurance in the future that we will be able to compete successfully with our competitors in our development, acquisition and leasing activities. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We and our properties are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental, health, safety and similar laws including: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Americans with Disabilities Act. &#32;Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily accessible accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect. 

Affordable Care Act. Effective January 2015, we may be subject to excise taxes under the employer mandate provisions of the Affordable Care Act ("ACA"), if we (i) do not offer health care coverage to substantially all of our full-time employees and their dependents; or (ii) do not offer health care coverage that meets the ACA's affordability and minimum value standards. The excise tax is based on the number of full-time employees. We do not anticipate being subject to a penalty under the ACA; however, even in the event that we are, any such penalty would be less than $0.3 million, as we have 145 &#32;full-time employees as of December 31, 2015 . 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Environmental Regulations. &#32;Some properties in our portfolio contain, may have contained or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain underground storage tanks for petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. These storage tanks may have released, or have the potential to release, such substances into the environment. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In addition, some of our properties have tenants which may use hazardous or toxic substances in the routine course of their businesses. In general, these tenants have covenanted in their leases with us to use these substances, if any, in compliance with all environmental laws and have agreed to indemnify us for any damages we may suffer as a result of their use of such substances. However, these lease provisions may not fully protect us in the event that a tenant becomes insolvent. Finally, one of our properties has contained asbestos-containing building materials, or ACBM, and another property may have contained such materials based on the date of its construction. Environmental laws require that ACBM be properly managed and maintained, and fines and penalties may be imposed on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements. The laws also may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. 

Neither existing environmental, health, safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results operations, and management does not believe they will in the future. In addition, we have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past. However, we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

With environmental sustainability becoming a national priority, we have continued to demonstrate our strong commitment to be a responsible corporate citizen through resource reduction and employee training that have resulted in reductions of energy consumption, waste and improved maintenance cycles. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, and rental loss insurance that covers all properties in our portfolio. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage, and industry practice. Certain risks such as loss from riots, war or acts of God, and, in some cases, flooding are not insurable; and therefore, we do not carry insurance for these losses. Some of our policies, such as those covering losses due to terrorism and floods, are insured subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co-payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover losses. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Offices 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our principal executive office is located at 30 S. Meridian Street, Suite 1100, Indianapolis, IN 46204. Our telephone number is (317) 577-5600. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 145 &#32;full-time employees. The majority of these employees were based at our Indianapolis, Indiana headquarters. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Segment Reporting 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our primary business is the ownership and operation of neighborhood and community shopping centers. We do not distinguish or group our operations on a geographical basis, or any other basis, when measuring performance. Accordingly, we have one operating segment, which also serves as our reportable segment for disclosure purposes in accordance with GAAP.
