 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Royal Gold, Inc. ("Royal Gold", the "Company", "we", "us", or "our"), together with its subsidiaries, is engaged in the business of acquiring and managing precious metal streams, royalties, and similar interests. We seek to acquire existing stream and royalty interests or to finance projects that are in production or in the development stage in exchange for stream or royalty interests. 

We manage our business under two segments: 

Acquisition and Management of Stream Interests &#151;A metal stream is a purchase agreement that provides, in exchange for an upfront deposit payment, the right to purchase all or a portion of one or more metals produced from a mine, at a price determined for the term of the agreement. As of June 30, 2016, we owned stream interests on four producing properties and three development stage properties. As discussed further below, we invested approximately $1.3 billion in stream interests in our fiscal year 2016, including stream interests relating to Pueblo Viejo, Carmen de Andacollo ("Andacollo"), Wassa and Prestea, and Rainy River. Our stream interests accounted for approximately 66% and 34% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect stream interests to continue growing as a proportion of our total revenue. 

Acquisition and Management of Royalty Interests &#151;Royalties are non-operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to revenue or metals produced from the project after deducting specified costs, if any. As of June 30, 2016, we owned royalty interests on 34 producing properties, 21 development stage properties and 131 exploration stage properties, of which we consider 50 to be evaluation stage projects. We use "evaluation stage" to describe exploration stage properties that contain mineralized material and on which operators are engaged in the search for reserves. Royalties accounted for approximately 34% and 66% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

We do not conduct mining operations on the properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests, and except for our interest in the Peak Gold, LLC joint venture ("Peak Gold"), we are not required to contribute to capital costs, exploration costs, environmental costs or other operating costs on those properties. 

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in a continual review of opportunities to acquire existing stream and royalty interests, to establish new streams on operating mines, to create new stream and royalty interests through the financing of mine development or exploration, or to acquire companies that hold stream and royalty interests. We currently, and generally at any time, have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review, including, for example, our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities, analysis of technical, financial and other confidential information, submission of indications of interest and term sheets, participation in preliminary discussions and negotiations and involvement as a bidder in competitive processes. 

As discussed in further detail throughout this report, some significant developments to our business during fiscal year 2016 were as follows: 

(1) Our revenue increased 29% to $359.8 million, compared to $278.0 million during fiscal year 2015; (2) We acquired a gold and silver stream on the Pueblo Viejo mine located in the Dominican Republic; (3) We acquired a gold stream on the Andacollo copper-gold mine located in Chile and terminated the previously held royalty at Andacollo; (4) We acquired a gold stream on the Wassa and Prestea mines located in Ghana; (5) We acquired a gold and silver stream on the Rainy River Project located in Canada; and (6) We increased our calendar year dividend to $0.92 per basic share, which is paid in quarterly installments throughout calendar year 2016. This represents a 5% increase compared with the dividend paid during calendar year 2015. Certain Definitions 

Dollar or "$": Unless we have indicated otherwise, or the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to "$" or "dollar" are to the currency of the United States. We refer to Canadian dollars as C$. 

Gross Smelter Return (GSR) Royalty: A defined percentage of the gross revenue from a resource extraction operation, less, if applicable, certain contract-defined costs paid by or charged to the operator. 

Metal Stream: A purchase agreement that provides, in exchange for an upfront advance payment, the right to purchase all or a portion of one or more metals produced from a mine, at a price determined for the life of the transaction by the purchase agreement. 

Mineralized Material: That part of a mineral system that have potential economic significance, but is not included in the proven and probably reserve estimates until further drilling and metallurgical work is completed, and until other economic and technical feasibility factors based on such work have been resolved. 

Net Smelter Return (NSR) Royalty: A defined percentage of the gross revenue from a resource extraction operation, less a proportionate share of incidental transportation, insurance, refining and smelting costs. 

Net Value Royalty (NVR): A defined percentage of the gross revenue from a resource extraction operation, less certain contract-defined costs. 

Net Revenue: Net revenue is calculated as Royal Gold's Revenue minus Cost of sales. 

Probable Reserves: Ore reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume geological continuity between points of observation. 

Proven Reserves: Ore reserves for which (a) the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes, and grade is computed from the results of detailed sampling, and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that the size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. 

Payable Metal: Ounces or pounds of metal in concentrate after deduction of a percentage of metal in concentrate by a third-party smelter pursuant to smelting contracts. 

Reserve: That part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. 

Royalty: The right to receive a percentage or other denomination of mineral production from a mining operation. 

Ton: A unit of weight equal to 2,000 pounds or 907.2 kilograms. 

Tonne: A unit of weight equal to 2,204.6 pounds or 1,000 kilograms. 

Recent Business Developments 

Mount Milligan Commitment Letter 

On July 5, 2016, we entered into a binding commitment letter with Centerra Gold Inc. ("Centerra") setting forth the key terms and conditions of a future amendment to our Mount Milligan streaming agreement in connection with the proposed acquisition by Centerra of Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc. ("Thompson Creek") by Plan of Arrangement under the Arrangement Agreement executed between Centerra and Thompson Creek, as announced on July 5, 2016 (the "Centerra Acquisition"). Thompson Creek is the parent company of Terrane Metals Corp. ("Terrane"), which owns and operates the Mount Milligan copper-gold mine. Our obligation to amend the Mount Milligan streaming agreement is subject to the consummation of the Centerra Acquisition and other customary conditions set forth in the commitment letter. 

Under the commitment letter, we also agreed to an exclusivity arrangement with Centerra that prohibits us from negotiating and entering into any agreement with any person (other than Centerra) relating to Thompson Creek's obligations under the streaming agreement until the earliest of (i) the closing or abandonment of the Centerra Acquisition, (ii) the date, if any, on which shareholders of Thompson Creek decline to approve the Centerra Acquisition, or (iii) November 30, 2016. 

Pursuant to the terms of the commitment letter, we and Centerra have agreed to amend the streaming agreement, effective on the closing of the Centerra Acquisition, as follows: 

&#149; the existing 52.25% gold streaming interest will be amended to 35.00%; &#149; we will obtain an 18.75% copper streaming interest at Mount Milligan at a price equal to 15% of the spot price for each metric tonne of copper delivered; &#149; the existing restriction of $400 million on senior secured debt covered by the Mount Milligan assets will be extended until we receive the full return of our $781.5 million deposit (the "Payment Deposit"); 3 

&#149; until we have received the full return of the Payment Deposit and an additional 35,000 metric tonnes of copper, Terrane will maintain a leverage ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of no greater than 3:1 (including intercompany debt that ranks parri passu with or in priority to our streaming agreement); &#149; Terrane will not make distributions of cash or property to any of its affiliates if Terrane or Thompson Creek is in default under the streaming agreement; and &#149; we will enter into an intercreditor agreement with lenders providing $325 million in senior secured debt financing to Centerra in connection with the Centerra Acquisition, pursuant to which we will (i) retain our first priority security interest in 35.00% of the payable gold produced from Mount Milligan and all proceeds thereof, (ii) obtain a first priority security interest in 18.75% of the payable copper produced from Mount Milligan and all proceeds thereof, and (iii) otherwise agree to subordinate our security interests on all other assets of Terrane on terms and conditions substantially similar to those contained in our existing intercreditor agreement with the security agent for the benefit of the holders of Thompson Creek's 9.75% Senior Secured First Priority Notes due 2017. In connection with the closing of the Centerra Acquisition, Centerra will redeem all of Thompson Creek's secured and unsecured notes at their call price plus accrued and unpaid interest, which Centerra expects to finance through the combination of the $325 million senior secured debt referred to above and approximately C$185.7 million in net proceeds from a recent equity offering. The Centerra Acquisition will require the approval of the holders of two-thirds of Thompson Creek's outstanding common stock and will be subject to court and applicable regulatory approvals, in addition to other customary closing conditions. The Centerra Acquisition is expected to close in the fall of calendar 2016. 

Fiscal 2016 Business Developments 

Please refer to Item 7, MD&#38;A, for discussion on recent liquidity and capital resource developments. 

Acquisition of Gold and Silver Stream at Pueblo Viejo 

On September 29, 2015, RGLD Gold AG ("RGLD Gold"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, closed a Precious Metals Purchase and Sale Agreement with Barrick Gold Corporation ("Barrick") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, BGC Holdings Ltd. ("BGC") for a percentage of the gold and silver production attributable to Barrick's 60% interest in the Pueblo Viejo mine located in the Dominican Republic. Pursuant to the Precious Metals Purchase and Sale Agreement, RGLD Gold made a single advance payment of $610 million to BGC as part of the closing. The transaction was effective as of July 1, 2015 for the gold stream and January 1, 2016 for the silver stream. 

BGC will deliver gold to RGLD Gold in amounts equal to 7.50% of Barrick's interest in the gold produced at the Pueblo Viejo mine until 990,000 ounces of gold have been delivered, and 3.75% of Barrick's interest in gold produced thereafter. RGLD Gold will pay BGC 30% of the spot price per ounce of gold delivered until 550,000 ounces of gold have been delivered, and 60% of the spot price per ounce delivered thereafter. RGLD Gold received its first delivery of gold from Pueblo Viejo on December 15, 2015. 

BGC will deliver silver to RGLD Gold in amounts equal to 75% of Barrick's interest in the silver produced at the Pueblo Viejo mine, subject to a minimum silver recovery of 70%, until 50.0 million ounces of silver have been delivered, and 37.50% of Barrick's interest in silver produced thereafter. RGLD Gold will pay BGC 30% of the spot price per ounce of silver delivered until 23.10 million ounces of silver have been delivered, and 60% of the spot price per ounce of silver delivered 

thereafter. RGLD Gold received its first delivery of 209,800 ounces of silver from Pueblo Viejo on March 15, 2016 for the period January through February 2016. 

The Pueblo Viejo mine is an open-pit mining operation located approximately 60 miles northwest of Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic, and is owned by a joint venture in which Barrick holds a 60% interest and is responsible for operations, and in which Goldcorp Inc. ("Goldcorp") holds a 40% interest. The mine began production in 2013. Barrick reported calendar 2016 production forecast, on a 60% basis, of 600,000-650,000 ounces of gold. Barrick also reported proven and probable gold reserves attributable to Barrick of 9.0 million contained ounces at 2.97 grams per tonne, and attributable proven and probable silver reserves of 54.1 million contained ounces grading 17.9 grams per tonne, in each case as of December 31, 2015. 

Acquisition and Amendment of Gold Stream on Wassa and Prestea 

On July 28, 2015, RGLD Gold closed a $130 million gold stream transaction with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Golden Star Resources Ltd. (together "Golden Star"). On December 30, 2015, the parties executed an amendment providing for an additional $15 million investment (for a total investment of $145 million) by RGLD Gold. 

Funds will be used for ongoing development of Golden Star's Wassa and Prestea mines in Ghana. As of June 30, 2016, RGLD Gold has advanced $95 million. On July 1, 2016, RGLD Gold made an advance payment of $20 million and expects to advance the balance in two quarterly payments as follows: (i) $20 million on October 1, 2016, and (ii) $10 million on January 1, 2017; however this schedule may be modified based on the actual spending on the Wassa and Prestea underground projects and these funds are subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. 

In return, Golden Star will deliver to RGLD Gold 9.25% of gold produced from the Wassa and Prestea mines, until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2017 or (ii) the date at which the Wassa and Prestea underground projects achieve commercial production. At that point, the stream percentage will increase to 10.5% of gold produced from the Wassa and Prestea mines until an aggregate 240,000 ounces have been delivered. Once the applicable delivery threshold is met, the stream percentage will decrease to 5.5% for the remaining term of the transaction. 

RGLD Gold will pay Golden Star a cash price equal to 20% of the spot price for each ounce of gold delivered at the time of delivery until the applicable delivery threshold is met, and 30% of the spot price for each ounce of gold delivered thereafter. 

The Wassa mine is located approximately 90 miles west of Accra and has operated continuously since 2005. Golden Star forecasts calendar 2016 production of 100,000 to 110,000 ounces of gold from the single Wassa open pit and 20,000 to 25,000 ounces of gold from pre-commercial production from the developing Wassa underground. Open pit proven and probable reserves are 878,000 ounces at 1.59 grams per tonne, as of December 31, 2015. RGLD Gold's investment will fund development of the Wassa underground deposit, which has 796,000 ounces of probable gold reserves at 4.59 grams per tonne. Once the underground deposit is in production, Golden Star expects average annual gold production of approximately 160,000 ounces of gold over the life of mine from the combined open pit and underground at Wassa. 

Prestea is located approximately 125 miles west of Accra and has produced over 9 million ounces of gold from both open pit and underground sources over the last 100 years. Prestea underground probable gold reserves are 469,000 ounces at 14.02 grams per tonne as of December 31, 2015. Golden Star forecasts calendar 2016 production of 60,000 to 70,000 ounces of gold from the open pit operations. Underground development at Prestea is already well advanced. Golden Star expects to spend $36 million of capital investment on Prestea, which includes hoist and shaft upgrades, electrical infrastructure, ventilation and a process plant upgrade. Once in full production, Golden Star expects 

annual production of approximately 90,000 ounces from Prestea, with estimated life of mine production of 450,000 ounces. Golden Star forecasts underground gold production from the Wassa and Prestea mines by mid-calendar 2016 and mid-calendar 2017, respectively. 

Also on July 28, 2015 and separate from the stream transaction by RGLD Gold, the Company funded a $20 million, 4-year term loan to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Golden Star and received warrants to purchase 5 million shares of Golden Star common stock. Interest under the term loan is due quarterly at a rate equal to 62.5% of the average daily gold price for the relevant quarter divided by 10,000, but not to exceed 11.5%. The warrants have a term of four years and an exercise price of $0.27. 

Acquisition of Gold and Silver Stream at Rainy River 

On July 20, 2015, RGLD Gold entered into a $175 million Purchase and Sale Agreement with New Gold, Inc. ("New Gold"), for a percentage of the gold and silver production from the Rainy River Project located in Ontario, Canada ("Rainy River"). Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, RGLD Gold made an advance payment to New Gold, consisting of $100 million on July 20, 2015, and will make an additional advance payment of $75 million once capital spending at Rainy River is 60% complete (currently expected during the second half of calendar 2016). Under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, New Gold will deliver to RGLD Gold 6.50% of the gold produced at Rainy River until 230,000 gold ounces have been delivered, and 3.25% thereafter. New Gold also will deliver to RGLD Gold 60% of the silver produced at Rainy River until 3.10 million silver ounces have been delivered, and 30% thereafter. RGLD Gold will pay New Gold 25% of the spot price per ounce of gold and silver at the time of delivery. 

The Rainy River Project is located approximately 40 miles northwest of Fort Frances in western Ontario, Canada. Over its first nine years of full production, the 21,000 tonne per day, combined open pit-underground operation is scheduled to produce an average of 325,000 ounces of gold per year. Construction was initiated in calendar 2015 and at the end of June 2016, overall construction was over 40% complete. Rainy River has an estimated fourteen year mine life based on current reserves and is projected by New Gold to start-up in mid-calendar 2017. 

Acquisition of Gold Stream at Carmen de Andacollo 

On July 9, 2015, RGLD Gold entered into a Long Term Offtake Agreement (the "Andacollo Stream Agreement") with Compa&#241;&#237;a Minera Teck Carmen de Andacollo ("CMCA"), a 90% owned subsidiary of Teck Resources Limited ("Teck"). Pursuant to the Andacollo Stream Agreement, CMCA will sell and deliver to RGLD Gold 100% of payable gold from the Andacollo copper-gold mine until 900,000 ounces have been delivered, and 50% thereafter, subject to a fixed payable percentage of 89%. RGLD Gold made a $525 million advance payment in cash to CMCA upon entry into the Andacollo Stream Agreement, and RGLD Gold will also pay CMCA 15% of the monthly average gold price for the month preceding the delivery date for all gold purchased under the Andacollo Stream Agreement. 

The transaction encompasses certain of CMCA's presently owned mining concessions on the Andacollo mine, as well as any other mining concessions presently owned or acquired by CMCA or any of its affiliates within a 1.5 kilometer area of interest, and certain other mining concessions that CMCA or its affiliates may acquire. The Andacollo Stream Agreement was effective as of July 1, 2015, and applies to all final settlements of gold received on or after that date. 

Termination of Royalty Interest at Carmen de Andacollo 

On July 9, 2015, Royal Gold Chile Limitada ("RG Chile"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Royalty Termination Agreement with CMCA. The Royalty Termination Agreement terminated an amended Royalty Agreement originally dated January 12, 2010, which 

provided RG Chile with a royalty equivalent to 75% of the gold produced from the sulfide portion of the Andacollo mine until 910,000 payable ounces have been produced, and 50% of the gold produced thereafter. CMCA paid total consideration of $345 million to RG Chile in connection with the Royalty Termination Agreement. The royalty termination transaction was taxable in Chile and the United States.

Please see " Operations in foreign jurisdictions are subject to many risks, which could decrease our revenues ," under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this report for a description of the risks attendant to foreign operations. 

Our financial results are primarily tied to the price of gold and, to a lesser extent, the price of silver and copper, together with the amounts of production from our producing stage stream and royalty interests. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, Royal Gold derived approximately 91% of its revenue from precious metals (including 88% from gold and 3% from silver), 4% from copper and 5% from other minerals. The price of gold, silver, copper and other metals has fluctuated widely in recent years, having declined from highs experienced in the first half of our fiscal year 2013, with the price of gold and silver having rebounded during the second half of our fiscal 2016. The marketability and the price of metals are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control. 

Competition 

The mining industry in general and streaming and royalty segments in particular are competitive. We compete with other streaming and royalty companies, mine operators, and financial buyers in efforts to acquire existing royalty interests, and with the lenders, investors, and streaming and royalty companies providing financing to operators of mineral properties in our efforts to create new royalty interests. Our competitors in the lending and mining business may be larger than we are and may have greater resources and access to capital than we have. Key competitive factors in the stream and royalty acquisition and financing business include the ability to identify and evaluate potential opportunities, transaction structure and consideration, and access to capital. 

Regulation 

Operators of the mines that are subject to our stream and royalty interests must comply with numerous environmental, mine safety, land use, waste disposal, remediation and public health laws and regulations promulgated by federal, state, provincial and local governments in the United States, Canada, Chile, Mexico, Dominican Republic and other countries where we hold interests. Although we are not responsible as a stream and royalty interest owner for ensuring compliance with these laws and regulations, failure by the operators of the mines on which we have stream and royalty interests to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits can result in injunctive action, damages and civil and criminal penalties on the operators.
