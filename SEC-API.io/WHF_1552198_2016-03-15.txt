 Item 1. Business General We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. In addition, for tax purposes, we elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and intend to qualify annually for such treatment. 

We are a direct lender targeting debt investments in privately held, small-cap companies located in the United States. We define the small-cap market as those companies with enterprise values between $50 million and $350 million. Our investment objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns primarily by originating and investing in senior secured loans, including first lien and second lien facilities, to performing small-cap companies across a broad range of industries that typically carry a floating interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, and have a term of three to six years. While we focus principally on originating senior secured loans to small-cap companies, we may also make opportunistic investments at other levels of a company&#146;s capital structure, including mezzanine loans or equity interests. We also may receive warrants to purchase common stock in connection with our debt investments. We generate current income through the receipt of interest payments, as well as origination and other fees, capital appreciation and dividends. 

&#160;

&#160;

We invest primarily in securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that may be rated below investment grade if they were so rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as &#147;junk&#148; bonds, are viewed as speculative investments because of concerns with respect to the issuer&#146;s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. 

As of December 31, 2015, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of senior secured loans across 35 positions in 29 companies with an aggregate fair value of approximately $415.3 million. As of December 31, 2014, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of senior secured loans across 37 positions in 31 companies with an aggregate fair value of approximately $403.5 million. At both dates, the majority of our portfolio comprised senior secured loans to small-cap borrowers.

About H.I.G. Capital H.I.G. Capital, founded in 1993, is a leading global alternative asset manager focused on the small-cap market. As of December 31, 2015, H.I.G. Capital managed approximately $17 billion of capital (based on regulatory assets under management, as reported on Form ADV) across multiple investment funds supported by approximately 300 dedicated investment professionals. These investment professionals bring a depth of experience and skills across a broad range of industries and transaction types, including primary loan originations, secondary debt purchases and special situations and distressed debt investing. 

Investment Strategy Our investment strategy is to generate current income and capital appreciation primarily by originating secured loans. We seek to create a broad portfolio consisting of investments generally in the range of $10 million to $50 million primarily in debt securities and loans of U.S. based small-cap companies. We primarily target borrowers in the United States with enterprise values of $50 million to $350 million across a broad range of industries. The proceeds of our loans are used for a variety of purposes, including refinancings of existing debt, acquisition financing, or working capital to support growth or realignment. 

While we focus principally on originating senior secured loans to small-cap companies that we believe have attractive risk adjusted returns, including first lien and second lien facilities, we may also opportunistically make investments at other levels of a company&#146;s capital structure, including mezzanine loans or equity interests. We also may receive warrants to purchase common stock in connection with our debt investments. We may also invest in assets consistent with our investment strategy indirectly through the acquisitions of interests in other investment companies. We generate current income through the receipt of interest payments, origination and other fees, and dividends. Our typical loans carry a floating interest rate based on LIBOR plus a spread, have a term of three to six years, are secured by all tangible and intangible assets of the borrower and include covenants, monitoring and information rights in favor of the lender. 

Target businesses will typically exhibit some or all of the following characteristics: 

&#149; enterprise value of between $50 million and $350 million; &#149; organized in the United States; &#149; experienced management team; &#149; stable and predictable free cash flows; &#149; discernible downside protection through recurring revenue or strong tangible asset coverage; &#149; products and services with distinctive competitive advantages or other barriers to entry; &#149; low technology and market risk; and &#149; strong customer relationships. None of these investment policies are fundamental and they may be changed without stockholder approval. 

We expect that, from time to time, our investments may include certain non-qualifying assets, including assets of non-U.S. companies, certain publicly traded companies and, to a lesser extent and subject to certain limits under the 1940 Act, registered or unregistered investment companies, to the extent permissible under the 1940 Act. 

Investment Process Overview Sourcing . Our deal flow and idea generation for small-cap investments primarily originates from H.I.G. Capital&#146;s existing and extensive network of informal and unconventional deal sources in the small-cap business community. Built over the past 22 years, this deal sourcing network includes accountants, attorneys, brokers, insurance agents, consultants and financial advisors who have access to small-cap companies. The contacts in H.I.G. Capital&#146;s network generally operate outside of the structured investment banking infrastructure and typically play a limited introductory role to the companies and their management teams. In addition, H.I.G. Capital promotes a culture in which sourcing is considered a focus for all of its approximately 

&#160;

&#160;

300 investment professionals in each of its 13 offices, from analysts to managing directors. Lastly, H.I.G. Capital&#146;s in-house business development group of approximately 20 dedicated deal sourcing professionals supplements this effort through an outbound calling program. 

Due Diligence . We believe that the cornerstone of generating attractive risk-adjusted returns is a thorough due diligence process. We utilize the same methodology to evaluate potential investments that H.I.G. Capital has used over the past 22 years, which includes employing a highly analytical, private equity-like framework for rigorously assessing companies, extensive due diligence and a disciplined risk valuation methodology that guides investment decisions. As part of every transaction we consider and analyze the following key target company criteria: (1) cash flow generation, (2) underlying asset valuation, (3) competitive position, (4) industry dynamics and (5) strength of management. In addition, our due diligence process for small-cap companies will typically entail: 

&#149; a thorough review of historical and pro forma financial information; &#149; on-site visits with management; &#149; a review of loan documents and material contracts; &#149; third-party &#147;quality of earnings&#148; accounting due diligence, when appropriate; &#149; research relating to the company&#146;s business, industry, markets, products and services of competitors; &#149; background checks on key managers; and &#149; the commission of third-party market studies, when appropriate. Structuring Originations . Our investment adviser&#146;s team has substantial expertise in structuring and documenting loans originated to small-cap companies. Our investment adviser works with outside counsel to structure loans with strong creditor protections and contractual controls over borrower operations. Our investment adviser works to obtain extensive operating and financial covenants, detailed reporting requirements, governance rights and board of directors seats to protect our investment while allowing the borrower the necessary flexibility to execute its business plan successfully. We believe that our investment adviser&#146;s extensive experience investing in distressed debt and special situations allows it to anticipate the form of potential restructurings in order to maximize our potential recovery in such an event, and to better structure our loan and credit documentation to protect us from risks identified in the due diligence process. Our investment adviser also evaluates the broader capital structure of the borrower to ensure that we have strong rights as compared to other participants in the borrower&#146;s capital structure. 

Portfolio Management and Monitoring . We actively monitor and manage our portfolio with regard to individual company performance as well as general market conditions. Investment decisions on new originations generally include an analysis of the impact of the new loan on our broader portfolio, including a &#147;top-down&#148; assessment of portfolio diversification and risk exposure. This assessment includes a review of portfolio concentration by issuer, industry, geography and type of credit as well as an evaluation of our portfolio&#146;s exposure to macroeconomic factors and cyclical trends. 

We believe that consistent, active monitoring of individual companies and the broader market is integral to portfolio management and a critical component of our investment process. Our investment adviser uses several methods to evaluate and monitor the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 

&#149; frequent discussions with management and sponsors, including board observation rights where possible; &#149; comparing/analyzing financial performance to the portfolio company&#146;s business plan, as well as our internal projections developed during the underwriting process; &#149; tracking portfolio company compliance with covenants as well as other metrics identified at the initial investment stage, such as acquisitions, divestitures, product development and specified management hires; and 

&#160;

&#160;

&#149; periodic review by the investment committee of each asset in the portfolio and more rigorous monitoring of &#147;watch list&#148; positions. As part of the monitoring process, our investment adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. This risk rating system is intended to identify and assess risks relative to when we initially made the investment and could be impacted by such factors as company-specific performance, changes in collateral, changes in potential exit opportunities or macroeconomic conditions. 

All investments are initially assigned a rating of 2, as this grade represents a company that is meeting initial expectations with regard to performance and outlook. A rating may be improved to a 1 if, in the opinion of our investment adviser, a portfolio company&#146;s risk of loss has been reduced relative to initial expectations. An investment will be assigned a rating of 3 if the risk of loss has increased relative to initial expectations and will be assigned a rating of 4 if our investment principal is at a material risk of not being fully repaid. A rating of 5 indicates an investment is in payment default and has significant risk of not receiving full repayment. 

The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2015 and 2014: 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; December 31, 2015 &#160; December 31, 2014 Investment Performance Rating &#160; Investments at Fair Value (Dollars in Millions) &#160; Percentage of Total Portfolio &#160; Investments at Fair Value (Dollars in Millions) &#160; Percentage of Total Portfolio 1 &#160; $ &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.0 %&#160; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.0 %&#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 375.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; 90.3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 403.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100.0 &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; 32.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7.9 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.0 &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.0 &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; 7.3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.0 &#160; Total Portfolio &#160; $ 415.3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100.0 %&#160; &#160; $ 403.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100.0 %&#160; 

Investment Committee and Decision Process The investment committee oversees our investment activities, subject to the oversight of our board of directors, and is led by senior investment professionals of H.I.G. Capital. The investment committee process is intended to bring the experience and perspectives of the various members to the analysis and consideration of each investment. The investment committee process is a highly collaborative effort, typically beginning at the term sheet phase of a transaction and continuing through the close of the transaction. When an opportunity is first discussed, the investment committee assists the investment team in exploring the key issues requiring due diligence or deal structuring and identifying the available resources within H.I.G. Capital, including other H.I.G. investment professionals or senior managers from current and former portfolio companies with specific industry experience. Throughout the transaction process, the investment team meets regularly with the investment committee in a process which requires all of the investment committee&#146;s concerns to be appropriately addressed through due diligence and transaction structuring. This collaborative process between the investment team and the investment committee means that, by the time a potential transaction is ready for final approval or rejection, the investment committee members are already deeply familiar with it and have had an opportunity to address any concerns. As a result, investment committee decisions are made by consensus. The investment committee meets regularly, including special meetings on short notice, to approve or discuss material developments on new or existing investments. 

&#160;

&#160;

Competition Our primary competitors that provide financing to small-cap companies include public and private investment funds, including other business development companies, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, specialty finance companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to our Business and Structure &#151; The highly competitive market for investment opportunities in which we operate may limit our investment opportunities.&#148; 

Administration We do not have any direct employees, and our day-to-day investment operations are managed by our investment adviser. We have a chief executive officer, chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and, to the extent necessary, our board of directors may elect to hire additional personnel going forward. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, WhiteHorse Advisers, WhiteHorse Administration and their affiliates, respectively, have agreed to provide us with access to personnel, an investment committee and certain other resources so that we may perform our obligations as collateral manager. Our officers are employees of an affiliate of WhiteHorse Administration, an affiliate of our investment adviser, and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer along with their respective staffs is paid by us pursuant to the Administration Agreement. Some of our executive officers are also officers of WhiteHorse Advisers. See &#147;Business &#151; Management Agreements &#151; Administration Agreement.&#148; 

MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS Investment Advisory Agreement WhiteHorse Advisers serves as our investment adviser in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, our investment adviser manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment management services to us. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, WhiteHorse Advisers: 

&#149; determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; &#149; identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies); and &#149; closes, monitors and administers the investments we make, including the exercise of any voting or consent rights. WhiteHorse Advisers&#146; services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay WhiteHorse Advisers a fee for investment management services consisting of a base management fee and an incentive fee. 

Management Fee The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 2.0% of consolidated gross assets, including cash and cash equivalents and assets purchased with borrowed funds, and is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average carrying value of our consolidated gross assets, including cash and cash equivalents and assets purchased with borrowed funds, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the quarter. The management fees for any partial month or quarter is appropriately pro-rated. The Investment Advisory Agreement excluded cash and cash equivalents from the calculation of the base management fee for the calendar quarters ended December 31, 2012, March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013, and September 30, 2013. 

WhiteHorse Advisers agreed to waive that portion of the base management fee payable with respect to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents to which it would otherwise be entitled under the Investment Advisory Agreement for the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2013 and March 31, 2014; and for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2014 only to the extent that the determination of base 

&#160;

&#160;

management fees would otherwise include March 31, 2014 cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of calculating the average carrying value of consolidated gross assets. The waived fees are not subject to recoupment by the Investment Adviser. 

Performance-based Incentive Fee The performance-based incentive fee consists of two components that are independent of each other, except as provided by the incentive fee cap and deferral mechanism discussed below. 

The calculations of these two components have been structured to include a fee limitation such that no incentive fee will be paid to our investment adviser for any quarter if, after such payment, the cumulative incentive fees paid to our investment adviser for the period that includes the current fiscal quarter and the 11 full preceding fiscal quarters, referred to as the &#147;Incentive Fee Look-back Period,&#148; would exceed 20.0% of the Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period. Each quarterly incentive fee is subject to the Incentive Fee Cap (as defined below) and a deferral mechanism through which the Investment Adviser may recapture a portion of such deferred incentive fees, which is referred to together as the &#147;Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism.&#148; 

This limitation is accomplished by subjecting each incentive fee payable to a cap, which is referred to as the &#147;Incentive Fee Cap.&#148; The Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter is equal to (a) 20.0% of Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period less (b) cumulative incentive fees of any kind paid to the Investment Adviser during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period. To the extent the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value in any quarter, we will pay no incentive fee to our investment adviser in that quarter. WhiteHorse Finance will only pay incentive fees to the extent allowed by the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism. To the extent that the payment of incentive fees is limited by the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism, the payment of such fees may be deferred and paid in subsequent quarters up to three years after their date of deferment, subject to applicable limitations included in the Investment Advisory Agreement. The deferral component of the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism may cause incentive fees that accrued during one fiscal quarter to be paid to our investment adviser at any time during the 11 full fiscal quarters following such initial full fiscal quarter. 

The Incentive Fee Look-back Period commenced on January 1, 2013. Prior to January 1, 2016, the Incentive Fee Look-back Period consisted of fewer than 12 full fiscal quarters. 

The &#147;Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return&#148; refers to the sum of (a) Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for each period during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period and (b) the sum of cumulative realized capital gains, cumulative realized capital losses, cumulative unrealized capital depreciation and cumulative unrealized capital appreciation during the applicable Incentive Fee Look-back Period. 

The first component, which is income-based, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears, commencing with the quarter beginning January 1, 2013, based on our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism. For this purpose, &#147;Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income&#148; means, in each case on a consolidated basis, interest income, distribution income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, any interest expense and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 

The operation of the first component of the incentive fee for each quarter is as follows: 

&#149; no incentive fee is payable to our investment adviser in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the &#147;Hurdle Rate&#148; of 1.75% (7.00% annualized); 

&#160;

&#160;

&#149; 100% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized) is payable to our investment adviser. We refer to this portion of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (which exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than 2.1875%) as the &#147;catch-up.&#148; The effect of the catch-up is that, if such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter, our investment adviser will receive 20% of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if the Hurdle Rate did not apply; and &#149; 20% of the amount of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized) is payable to our investment adviser (once the Hurdle Rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 20% of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income). The portion of such incentive fee that is attributable to deferred interest (such as payment-in-kind, or PIK, interest or original issue discount) is paid to our investment adviser, together with interest from the date of deferral to the date of payment, only if and to the extent we actually receive such interest in cash, and any accrual will be reversed if and to the extent such interest is reversed in connection with any write-off or similar treatment of the investment giving rise to any deferred interest accrual. Any reversal of such amounts would reduce net income for the quarter by the net amount of the reversal (after taking into account the reversal of incentive fees payable) and would result in a reduction and possibly elimination of the incentive fees for such quarter. 

There is no accumulation of amounts on the Hurdle Rate from quarter to quarter and, accordingly, there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income earned in subsequent quarters is below the quarterly Hurdle Rate and there is no delay of payment if Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income earned in prior quarters are below the quarterly Hurdle Rate. Since the Hurdle Rate is fixed, as interest rates rise, it will be easier for our investment adviser to surpass the Hurdle Rate and receive an incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income. 

Net investment income used to calculate this component of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our consolidated gross assets used to calculate the 2.0% base management fee. This calculation will be appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter. 

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-based component of the incentive fee: 

Quarterly Incentive Fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets) 

Percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income allocated to first component of incentive fee The second component, the capital gains component of the incentive fee, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), commencing on January 1, 2013, and equals 20% of our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains from the beginning of each calendar year through the end of that calendar year, computed net of our aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and our aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation through the end of such year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees and subject to the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism. If such amount is negative, then no capital gains incentive fee will be payable for such year. Additionally, if the Investment Advisory Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date will be treated as though it were a 

&#160;

&#160;

calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying the capital gains incentive fee. The capital gains component of the incentive fee is not subject to any minimum return to stockholders. 

Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss subject to the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism. For example, if we receive Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in excess of the Hurdle Rate, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. 

Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation Each of the following examples assumes that the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism is met. 

Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee (*) Alternative 1 Assumptions Investment income (including interest, distributions, fees, etc.) = 1.25% 

Hurdle Rate (1) = 1.75% 

Base management fee (2) = 0.50% 

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.25% 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 

(investment income &#150; (base management fee + other expenses)) = 0.50% 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the Hurdle Rate, therefore there is no incentive fee. 

Alternative 2 Assumptions Investment income (including interest, distributions, fees, etc.) = 2.70% 

Hurdle Rate (1) = 1.75% 

Base management fee (2) = 0.50% 

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.25% 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 

(investment income &#150; (base management fee + other expenses)) = 1.95% 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the Hurdle Rate, therefore there is an incentive fee. 

Incentive fee = (100% &#215; &#147;catch-up&#148;) + (the greater of 0% AND (20% &#215; (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income &#150; 2.1875%))) &#160; = (100.0% &#215; (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income &#150; 1.75%)) + 0% &#160; = 100.0% &#215; (1.95% &#150; 1.75%) &#160; = 100.0% &#215; 0.20% &#160; = 0.20% 

&#160;

&#160;

Alternative 3 Assumptions Investment income (including interest, distributions, fees, etc.) = 3.00% 

Hurdle Rate (1) = 1.75% 

Base management fee (2) = 0.50% 

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.25% 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 

(investment income &#150; (base management fee + other expenses)) = 2.25% 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the Hurdle Rate, therefore there is an incentive fee. 

Incentive fee = (100% &#215; &#147;catch-up&#148;) + (the greater of 0% AND (20% &#215; (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income &#150; 2.1875%))) &#160; = (100% &#215; (2.1875% &#150; 1.75%)) + (20.0% &#215; (2.25% &#150; 2.1875%)) &#160; = 0.4375% + (20.0% &#215; 0.0625%) &#160; = 0.4375% + 0.0125% &#160; = 0.45% 

(*) The hypothetical amount of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income shown is based on a percentage of net assets. (1) Represents 7.00% annualized Hurdle Rate. (2) Represents 2.00% annualized base management fee. This amount does not reflect that our investment adviser has agreed to exclude cash and cash equivalents from the calculation of the base management fee for the calendar quarters ending December 31, 2012, March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013 and September 30, 2013. (3) Excludes organizational and offering expenses. Example 2: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee Alternative 1 Assumptions Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (&#147;Investment A&#148;), and $30 million investment made in Company B (&#147;Investment B&#148;) Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million and fair market value, or FMV, of Investment B determined to be $32 million Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million Year 4: Investment B sold for $31 million The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be: 

Year 1: None Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $6.0 million ($30 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20.0%) Year 3: None; $5.0 million (20.0% multiplied by ($30 million cumulative capital gains less $5.0 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $6.0 million (capital gains fee paid in Year 2) Year 4: Capital gains incentive fee of $200,000; $6.2 million ($31 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20.0%) less $6.0 million (capital gains fee paid in Year 2) 

&#160;

&#160;

Alternative 2 Assumptions Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (&#147;Investment A&#148;), $30 million investment made in Company B (&#147;Investment B&#148;) and $25 million investment made in Company C (&#147;Investment C&#148;) Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $25 million Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $27 million and Investment C sold for $30 million Year 4: FMV of Investment B determined to be $35 million Year 5: Investment B sold for $20 million The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be: 

Year 1: None Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $5.0 million; 20.0% multiplied by $25 million ($30 million realized capital gains on Investment A less $5 million unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B) Year 3: Capital gains incentive fee of $1.4 million; $6.4 million (20.0% multiplied by $32 million ($35 million cumulative realized capital gains less $3 million unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B)) less $5.0 million (capital gains fee received in Year 2) Year 4: None Year 5: None; $5.0 million of capital gains incentive fee (20.0% multiplied by $25 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $35 million less realized capital losses of $10 million)) less $6.4 million (cumulative capital gains fee paid in Year 2 and Year 3) Example 3: Application of the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism Assumptions In each of Years 1 through 4 in this example, as well as in each preceding year, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income equals $40.0 million per year, which we recognized evenly in each quarter of each year and paid quarterly. This amount exceeds the Hurdle Rate and the requirement of the &#147;catch-up&#148; in each quarter of such year. As a result, the annual income related portion of the incentive fee, before the application of the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism in any year is $8.0 million ($40.0 million multiplied by 20%), and the cumulative income related portion of the incentive fee before the application of the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism over any Incentive Fee Look-back Period prior to any payment of incentive fees during such year is $16.0 million ($8.0 million multiplied by two). All income-related incentive fees were paid quarterly in arrears. 

In each year preceding Year 1, we did not generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses, no capital gain-related incentive fee was paid and there was no deferral of incentive fees 

Year 1: We did not generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses Year 2: We realized a $30.0 million capital gain and did not otherwise generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses Year 3: We recognized a $5.0 million unrealized capital depreciation and did not otherwise generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses Year 4: We realized a $6.0 million capital gain and did not otherwise generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses

Duration and Termination The Investment Advisory Agreement, originally approved on September 18, 2012, was re-approved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of WhiteHorse Finance, on August 3, 2015. Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement remains in effect from year to year thereafter for a term of one year if approved annually by our board of directors, or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of WhiteHorse Finance. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days&#146; written notice to the other party. Any termination by us must be authorized either by our board of directors or by vote of our stockholders. See &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to our Business and Structure &#151; We depend upon key personnel of H.I.G. Capital and its affiliates.&#148; 

Limitation of Liability and Indemnification The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, WhiteHorse Advisers and its officers, managers, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Investment Adviser, including its general partner and the administrator are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable 

&#160;

&#160;

attorneys&#146; fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from WhiteHorse Advisers&#146; performance of its duties and obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser. 

Board of Directors Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement Our board of directors voted unanimously to approve the Investment Advisory Agreement. In reaching its decision to approve the Investment Advisory Agreement, our board of directors considered information it received relating to: 

&#149; the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to us by our investment adviser; &#149; comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other business development companies with similar investment objectives; &#149; our projected operating expenses and expense ratio compared to business development companies with similar investment objectives; &#149; any existing and potential sources of indirect income to our investment adviser or WhiteHorse Administration from their relationships with us and the profitability of those relationships; &#149; information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing such services under the Investment Advisory Agreement; &#149; the organizational capability and financial condition of our investment adviser and its affiliates; &#149; our investment adviser&#146;s practices regarding the selection and compensation of brokers that may execute our portfolio transactions and the brokers&#146; provision of brokerage and research services to our investment adviser; and &#149; the possibility of obtaining similar services from other third party service providers or through an internally managed structure. Based on the information that the board of directors reviewed, the considerations detailed above and further discussions, the board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of WhiteHorse Finance or the Investment Adviser, determined that the investment advisory fee rates are reasonable in relation to the services to be provided and approved the Investment Advisory Agreement. We expect that the board of directors will undertake the same or a similar review in connection with any proposed amendment to, or renewal of, the Investment Advisory Agreement. 

Administration Agreement Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, WhiteHorse Administration and its affiliates furnish us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services to enable us to operate. WhiteHorse Administration also provides us with access to the resources necessary for us to perform our obligations as portfolio manager of WhiteHorse Credit, under the Credit Facility and for certain portfolio companies. Under the Administration Agreement, WhiteHorse Administration performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include being responsible for the financial records which we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, WhiteHorse Administration assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Payments in respect of the obligations of WhiteHorse Administration and its affiliates under the Administration Agreement equal an amount based upon our allocable portion of WhiteHorse Administration&#146;s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer and chief financial officer along with their respective staffs. Under the Administration Agreement, WhiteHorse Administration also provides managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request such assistance. The renewal of the Administration Agreement was approved by our board of directors in November 2015. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days&#146; written notice to 

&#160;

&#160;

the other party. To the extent that our administrator outsources any of its functions, we will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis, without any profit to WhiteHorse Administration. 

Limitation of Liability and Indemnification The Administration Agreement provides that WhiteHorse Administration and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the administrator, including its members, are not liable to us or any of our stockholders for any action by it or and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the administrator, including its members, in connection with the performance of any of the administrator&#146;s duties or obligations under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as our administrator, or for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) or losses sustained by us or our stockholders, except that the foregoing exculpation does not extend to any act or omission constituting willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its obligations under either Administration Agreement. 

License Agreement We have entered into a trademark license agreement, or the License Agreement, with an affiliate of H.I.G. Capital pursuant to which we have been granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the &#147;WhiteHorse&#148; name. Under this agreement, we have a right to use the WhiteHorse name for so long as WhiteHorse Advisers or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. The License Agreement is terminable by either party at any time in its sole discretion upon 60 days&#146; prior written notice to the other party and is also terminable by the affiliate of H.I.G. Capital in the case of certain events of non-compliance. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the &#147;WhiteHorse&#148; name. 

&#160;

&#160;

REGULATION We have elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act and as a RIC, under Subchapter M of the Code. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between business development companies and their affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors of a business development company be persons other than &#147;interested persons,&#148; as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a business development company unless such change is approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 

Our board of directors may decide to issue common stock to finance our operations rather than issuing debt or other senior securities. As a business development company, we are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below current net asset value per share. We may, however, issue or sell our common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock, or sell warrants, options or rights to acquire such common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in the best interests of us and our stockholders, and if our stockholders approve such sale within the preceding 12 months. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). 

We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an &#147;underwriter&#148; as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations to the extent that we are permitted to engage in such hedging transactions without registering with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or the CFTC, as a commodity pool operator. However, we may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one or more investment companies. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. 

Qualifying Assets Under the 1940 Act, a business development company may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company&#146;s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 

(1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which: (a) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; (b) is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company, or SBIC, wholly owned by the business development company) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 

&#160;

&#160;

(c) satisfies any of the following: &#149; does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or has any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange subject to a maximum market capitalization of $250 million; or &#149; is controlled by a business development company or a group of companies including a business development company, and the business development company actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result, the business development company has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company. (2) Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control. (3) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. (4) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. (5) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. (6) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. The regulations defining and interpreting qualifying assets may change over time. We expect to adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area. 

Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies In addition, a business development company must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the business development company must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance. However, where a business development company purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby the business development company, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. 

WhiteHorse Administration provides such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. We may receive fees for these services and reimburse WhiteHorse Administration for its allocated costs in providing such assistance, subject to the review and approval by our board of directors, including our independent directors. 

Temporary Investments Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, so long as such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and 

&#160;

&#160;

the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would generally not meet the Diversification Tests (as defined below) in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our investment adviser monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 

Senior Securities We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our &#147;asset coverage,&#148; as that term is defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to our Business and Structure &#151; Regulations governing our operation as a business development company, including those related to the issuance of senior securities, will affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional debt or equity capital.&#148; 

Code of Ethics We and WhiteHorse Advisers have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code&#146;s requirements. You may read and copy the codes of ethics at the SEC&#146;s Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at (202) 551-8090. In addition, each code of ethics is included as an exhibit to this annual report on Form 10-K and is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC&#146;s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov . You may also obtain copies of each code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following email address: publicinfo@sec.gov , or by writing the SEC&#146;s Public Reference Section, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. 

Compliance Policies and Procedures We and our investment adviser have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Our chief compliance officer is responsible for administering our policies and procedures. 

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our investment adviser. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of our investment adviser are described below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by our investment adviser and our non-interested directors and, accordingly, are subject to change. For purposes of these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures described below, &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our&#148; and &#147;us&#148; refers to our investment adviser. 

Introduction As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, we have a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of our clients. As part of this duty, we recognize that we must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of our clients. 

These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 

&#160;

&#160;

Proxy Policies We vote proxies relating to our clients&#146; portfolio securities in what we perceive to be the best interest of our clients&#146; stockholders. We review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by our clients. In most cases, we will vote in favor of proposals that we believe are likely to increase the value of our clients&#146; portfolio securities. Although we will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our clients&#146; portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so. 

Our proxy voting decisions are made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of our clients&#146; investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. Where conflicts of interest may be present, we will disclose such conflicts, including to us, and may request guidance on how to vote such proxies. 

Proxy Voting Records You may obtain information without charge about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Investor Relations, 1450 Brickell Avenue, 31 st Floor, Miami, Florida 33131, or by calling us collect at (305) 381-6999. 

Privacy Principles We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 

Generally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain non-public personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third party administrator). 

We restrict access to non-public personal information about our stockholders to employees of the Investment Adviser and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders. 

Other Regulatory Considerations Under the 1940 Act, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a business development company, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#146;s office. We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. 

We and the Investment Adviser are each required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the U.S. federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 

We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates, including the Investment Adviser, without the prior approval of our board of directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. The SEC has interpreted the prohibition on transactions by business development companies with affiliates to prohibit &#147;joint&#148; transactions among 

&#160;

&#160;

entities that share a common investment adviser. The staff of the SEC has granted no-action relief permitting purchases of a single class of privately placed securities provided that the Investment Adviser negotiates no term other than price and certain other conditions are met. Except in certain limited circumstances, we will be unable to invest in any issuer in which another account sponsored or managed by our Investment Adviser has previously invested. 

On July 8, 2014, we received an exemptive relief order from the SEC, which permits us to participate in negotiated investments with our affiliates, subject to certain conditions. The exemptive relief order to co-invest with affiliated funds provides stockholders with access to a broader range of investment opportunities. 

Our stockholders approved us to issue and sell our common stock during a 12-month period ending on August 3, 2016 at a price below then-current net asset value, or NAV, per share. We may issue and sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current NAV per share of our common stock if our board determines that such sale is in the best interests of us and our stockholders, and if our stockholders approve such sale within the preceding 12 months. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price that, in the determination of our board, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). Our rights offering completed on November 20, 2015 resulted in the issuance of 3,321,033 additional shares of common stock at a price below the then-current NAV per share. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 

&#149; pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; &#149; pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; &#149; pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. This report must be audited by our independent registered public accounting firm beginning with the earlier of our fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 and the year in which our revenues first exceed $1.0 billion; and &#149; pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated under it. We continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance with that act. 

JOBS Act We are an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; as defined in the JOBS Act signed into law in April 2012 until the earliest of: 

&#149; the last day of our fiscal year ending December 31, 2017; &#149; the last day of the fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues first exceed $1 billion; &#149; the date on which we have, during the prior three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or 

&#160;

&#160;

&#149; the last day of a fiscal year in which we (1) have an aggregate worldwide market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates of $700 million or more, computed at the end of each fiscal year as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter and (2) have been an Exchange Act reporting company for at least one year (and filed at least one annual report under the Exchange Act). Under the JOBS Act, we are currently exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which would require that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This may increase the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. 

Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. While we are an emerging growth company, we are taking advantage of the extended transition period available to emerging growth companies to comply with &#147;new or revised accounting standards&#148; until those standards are applicable to private companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies. 

The NASDAQ Global Select Market Corporate Governance Regulations The NASDAQ Global Select Market has adopted corporate governance regulations that listed companies must comply with. As of the date of this report, we were in compliance with such corporate governance listing standards applicable to business development companies. 

Election to Be Taxed as a RIC As a business development company, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and intend to continue to qualify annually for such treatment. As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, an amount at least equal to 90% of our &#147;investment company taxable income,&#148; which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, plus the excess of any gross income exempt from U.S. federal income tax under Section 103(a) of the Code over deductions related to such tax-exempt income. In this annual report on Form 10-K, we refer to this distribution requirement as the &#147;Annual Distribution Requirement.&#148; 

Taxation as a RIC If we: 

&#149; qualify as a RIC; and &#149; satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement; then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain, defined as net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses, we distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on any net income or net capital gain not distributed to our stockholders. 

We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on our undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and capital gain net income for preceding years that were not distributed during such years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by us that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed. We intend to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to satisfy the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. 

&#160;

&#160;

In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must: 

&#149; qualify to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; &#149; derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, and net income derived from interests in &#147;qualified publicly traded partnerships&#148; (partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive 90% of their income from interest, dividends and other permitted RIC income), or the &#147;90% Income Test&#148;; and &#149; diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: &#151; at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and &#151; no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships, or the &#147;Diversification Tests&#148;. We may invest in partnerships, including qualified publicly traded partnerships, which may result in our being subject to state, local or foreign income, franchise or withholding liabilities. 

We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, with increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each taxable year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the instruments, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the taxable year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. 

Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (1) treat dividends that would otherwise constitute qualified dividend income as non-qualified dividend income, (2) treat dividends that would otherwise be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction as ineligible for such treatment, (3) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (4) convert lower-taxed long-term capital gain into higher-taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (5) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (6) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (7) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (8) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (9) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We intend to monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections to mitigate the effect of these provisions and prevent our disqualification as a RIC. 

Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long term or short term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant. 

Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless 

&#160;

&#160;

certain &#147;asset coverage&#148; tests are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our qualification as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 

We generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Investments in these types of instruments may present special tax issues for us. U.S. federal income tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as when we may cease to accrue interest, original issue discount or market discount, when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless instruments, how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and income and whether exchanges of debt obligations in a bankruptcy or workout context are taxable. These and other issues will be addressed by us to the extent necessary in order to seek to ensure that we distribute sufficient income such that we do not become subject to U.S. federal income or excise tax. 

Some of the income and fees that we may recognize will not satisfy the 90% Income Test. In order to mitigate the risk that such income and fees do not disqualify us as a RIC for a failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, we may be required to recognize such income and fees indirectly through one or more entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such corporations will be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income and fees. 

Failure to Qualify as a RIC If we were unable to qualify for continued treatment as a RIC and are unable to cure the failure, for example, by disposing of certain investments quickly or raising additional capital to prevent the loss of RIC status, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The Code provides some relief from RIC disqualification due to failures of the source of income and asset diversification requirements, although there may be additional taxes due in such cases. We cannot assure you that we would qualify for any such relief should we fail the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests. 

Should failure occur, not only would all our taxable income be subject to tax at regular corporate rates, we would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions, including distributions of net long-term capital gain, would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate stockholders would be eligible to claim a dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, and non-corporate stockholders would generally be able to treat such dividends as &#147;qualified dividend income,&#148; which is subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder&#146;s tax basis in our shares, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets ( i.e. , the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five years.
