 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act. We will continue to be an emerging growth company until: (i) the last day of our fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in Section 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

&#160;

As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from: 

&#160;

Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Exchange Act, which requires companies to hold stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation; 

&#160;

The requirement to provide in any registration statement periodic report or other report to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, certain modified executive compensation disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K or selected financial data under Item 301 of Regulation S-K for any period before the earliest audited period presented in our initial registration statement; 

&#160;

Compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies; 

&#160;

The requirement under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to provide auditor attestation of our internal controls and procedures; and 

&#160;

Any Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") rules regarding mandatory audit firm rotation, or an expanded auditor report and any other PCAOB rules subsequently adopted, unless the Securities and Exchange Commission determines the new rules are necessary for protecting the public. 

&#160;

We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. 

&#160;

Crowd 4 Seeds was incorporated in Nevada on April 11, 2014. Most of the activity through December 31, 2015 involved incorporation efforts and preparation for an Offering. 

&#160;

We are a development stage company and have limited financial resources. We have not established a source of equity or debt financing. Our financial statements include a note emphasizing the uncertainty of our ability to remain a going concern. 

&#160;

Crowd 4 Seeds plans to become an online platform for investments in Israeli startup companies through equity-based crowdfunding. This online platform would present startup companies in various fields. Potential investors will be able to click on any startup company they would like to know more about and get access to its marketing information and legal and financial disclosures. 

&#160;

Crowd 4 Seeds plans to match up Israeli startups looking to raise funds with potential investors from all over the world seeking to make investments in such startups. The goal is to help many startup companies that could not or would not raise funds from Angels or Venture Capital funds get access to a large pool of retail investors looking for such investment opportunities. Such match up would open another important fundraising channel for startup companies and allow retail investors to diversify their investment portfolio. We will not allow U.S. persons access to the materials presented by the startups offering their securities on our website, unless we first register as a broker-dealer with the SEC under Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Anyone trying to gain access to the offering materials posted on our website will first need to fill out a short questionnaire which will include a question about the country of residence. Anyone answering U.S.A or any of its states will be prohibited from gaining access to the page showing the offering materials of the presenting companies.

&#160; &#160;

Should we register as a broker-dealer in the U.S., only Accredited Investors, as such term is defined under Rule 501 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, will be allowed to have access to offering materials posted on our website. The website will ask any U.S. Person trying to gain access to offering materials to confirm its/his/her Accredited Investor status and to indicate which of such status alternatives applicable to it/him/her. Non-Accredited Investors will not be able to gain access to the offering materials. Offers and sales to Accredited Investors will be made in reliance on the exemption provided by Rule 506(c) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. All securities, whether issued to U.S. Persons or not, will bear a legend indicating that the securities are "restricted securities" and may not be sold in the U.S. absent an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of such securities or an available exemption from such registration requirement. 

&#160;

Crowd 4 Seeds' business plan is dependent on the effectiveness of the equity-based crowdfunding regulation in Israel. There is no assurance when such regulation will be effective, if ever. 

&#160;

Crowd 4 Seeds will keep a complete audit trail of investments in the startups presenting on its website. Funds committed for an investment will be kept in an escrow account until the startup's funding goal is reached. Upon reaching such goal, funds will be transferred from the escrow account to the startup's bank account while simultaneously stock certificates will be delivered to the investors. Should the funding goal not be reached until the deadline of the offering, funds would immediately be returned to the investors. 

&#160;

Business Model 

&#160;

Crowd 4 Seeds has two planned revenue models: Transaction Success Fees and Advertising Fees. 

&#160;

Transaction Revenue Model 

&#160;

Crowd 4 Seeds will provide its clients a web platform allowing a meet up with potential interested investors. Our web platform will be offered for Israeli companies looking to raise funds via equity-based crowdfunding. Such companies interested in using our platform for such purpose will post their offering materials on our website so that potential investors having access to the website could review them and decide whether they are interested in participating in the offering by making an investment. We will receive a certain percentage ranging between 5% to 10% as a transaction success fee for each fundraising campaign that reaches its funding goal. This certain percentage will be applied to the total amount raised and will be paid out of the escrow account immediately upon completion of a transaction. We will be entitled to a transaction success fee only for fundraising campaigns that reach their funding goals as such goals are determined by the companies launching these campaigns. We will not employ tiered funding goals. 

&#160;

Advertising Revenue Model 

&#160;

Crowd 4 Seeds would also consider allowing advertising on its website. We expect that if we will manage to generate meaningful traffic to our website, various market participants will be interested in exploring advertising opportunities with us. 

&#160;

Marketing &#38; Growth Strategy 

&#160;

Crowd 4 Seeds will grow the pool of startup companies looking to utilize its platform for equity-based crowdfunding by talking directly with, and presenting the opportunity to, startup incubators in Israel. Crowd 4 Seeds will also present its equity-based crowdfunding platform to different groups dedicated to helping Israeli startups and Israeli entrepreneurs. We plan to focus solely on Israeli startups. Crowd 4 Seeds will grow its pool of potential investors looking to explore the investment opportunities presented on our website by advertising on economic portals which are widely followed by retail investors. Crowd 4 Seeds will look for other channels for exposure such as writing columns about equity-based crowdfunding on widely-spread economic newspapers and/or economic websites.

Market Overview 

&#160;

Equity-based crowdfunding refers to the pooling of small capital investments from a large number of investors to finance a new or expanding business venture. In return, those investors receive a small stake in the company and expect to earn a profit if the company succeeds. The concept of crowdfunding is not new. Charities, social groups, churches and non-profit organizations have raised funds using similar methods for many years. Websites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo brought crowdfunding to the internet by allowing startup companies and entrepreneurs to accept monetary "donations" from project "backers." The difference between these crowdfunding campaigns and those contemplated under the Israeli Securities Law, however, is that investors under the Israeli Securities Law will be able to purchase a security interest in the company in which they are investing. 

&#160;

Currently, only investors who meet the definition of "Accredited Investor" under the Israeli Securities Law may participate in equity-based online crowdfunding campaigns. The formation of the equity-based crowdfunding regulation in Israel is currently at an advanced stage. There is no assurance, however, that such regulation will be completed and allow the general public to participate in equity-based crowdfunding campaigns. In September 2012, the Israeli Securities Authority ("ISA") established a committee with the aim to examine how the Israeli High-Tech industry may be better supported financially. One of the issues the committee had examined is the feasibility of fund-raising for young R&#38;D companies through what has known to be called "crowdfunding". The committee presented its interim conclusions to the ISA on June 4, 2013. The committee's final conclusions were submitted to the ISA on January 21, 2014. On June 5, 2014, a memorandum for a proposed set of rules, based on the findings of that committee, was released and on October 27, 2014 the formal proposal was submitted to the Israeli Parliament for a vote. The first round of votes, out of three rounds required for adoption of a proposed law, was approved on November 3, 2014. In December of 2015 the proposal was also approved by the second and third round of votes.The proposal should be finalized before it is adopted and signed into law. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Since legislation regulating online equity-based crowdfunding in Israel has yet to become effective, for the time being equity-based crowdfunding by the general public in Israel is not allowed and there are no websites that allow this kind of investment. There are, however, numerous websites that allow investors who meet the Israeli definition of "Accredited Investor" to invest in Israeli startups via the crowdfunding route. Among them are Ourcrowd and iAngels . It is possible that once legislation regulating equity-based crowdfunding investments in Israel becomes effective, these websites would adjust their platforms so they would support crowdfunding investments by the general public as well . 

&#160;

There are also donation-based crowdfunding websites in Israel. Among them are Headstart and Mimoona . Currently, these websites are solely focused on donation-based campaigns, but it is possible that these websites will support in the future equity-based crowdfunding campaigns as well. It is also possible that international "players" in the crowdfunding field, such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo, may decide to offer their platforms for crowdfunding campaigns once equity-based crowdfunding regulation in Israel becomes effective. 

&#160;

Regulatory Environment 

&#160;

Should the equity-based crowdfunding regulation in Israel be finally approved, equity-based crowdfunding portals will be subject to regulation by the ISA. Although the scope and specifications of that regulation have yet to be determined, it is expected that such regulation will include limitations on the amount a company could raise, the amount each investor could invest, the type of information that would need to be disclosed by the offering companies, as well as certain qualifications and obligations with respect to those involved in the equity-based crowdfunding process, and possibly a registration with the ISA.

Employees 

&#160;

As of March 18, 2016, we had one employee which serves as our president, and chief executive officer, Mr. Ostashinsky. During calendar year ending December 31, 2016 (dependent on financing and available working capital), Mr. Ostashinsky will devote at least twenty (20) hours a week to us and may increase the number of hours as necessary. Mr. Ostashinsky is under no contractual agreement with the Company. However, our president, and chief executive officer's current plan is to provide all administrative and planning work as well as initial marketing efforts on his own without any cash compensation while he seeks other sources of funding for the Company and its business plan. 

&#160;

Property 

&#160;

Our office and mailing address is 24 Tcharnihovsky St., Kfar Saba, Israel 44150. The space is provided to us by Mr. Ostashinsky. Mr. Ostashinsky incurs no incremental costs as a result of our using the space. Therefore, he does not charge us for its use. There is no written lease agreement. The current use of the space property is minimal.
