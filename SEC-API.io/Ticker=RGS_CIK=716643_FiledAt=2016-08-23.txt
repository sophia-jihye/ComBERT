 Item 1. Business 

General: 

Regis Corporation owns, franchises and operates beauty salons. The Company is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "RGS." Unless the context otherwise provides, when we refer to the "Company," "we," "our," or "us," we are referring to Regis Corporation, the Registrant, together with its subsidiaries. 

As of June 30, 2016 , the Company owned, franchised or held ownership interests in 9,483 &#32;locations worldwide. The Company's locations consist of 9,288 &#32;company-owned and franchised salons and 195 locations in which we maintain a non-controlling ownership interest of less than 100%. Each of the Company's salon concepts generally offer similar salon products and services and serve the mass marketplace. 

Service revenues comprise approximately 79% &#32;of total company-owned revenues. The major services supplied by the Company's salons are haircutting and styling (including shampooing and conditioning), hair coloring and other services. The percentage of company-owned service revenues in each fiscal year 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 &#32;attributable to haircutting and styling, hair coloring and other services were 72% , 19% &#32;and 9% , respectively. 

The Company reports its operations in three operating segments: North American Value, North American Premium and International. The Company's North American Value salon operations are comprised of 5,784 &#32;company-owned salons and 2,496 franchised salons operating in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico.

The Company's salons operate primarily under the trade names of SmartStyle, Supercuts, MasterCuts, Regis Salons, and Cost Cutters, and they generally serve two categories within the industry, value and premium. SmartStyle, Supercuts, MasterCuts, Cost Cutters, and other regional trade names are generally within the value category, offering high quality, convenience, and affordably priced hair care and beauty services and retail products. Regis Salons, among other trade names, are in the premium category, offering upscale hair care and beauty services and retail products. The Company's North American Value business is located mainly in strip center locations and Walmart Supercenters and the North American Premium business is primarily in mall-based locations. During fiscal years 2016 &#32;and 2015 , the number of guest visits at the Company's company-owned salons approximated 72 &#32;and 76 million , respectively. 

Financial information about our segments and geographic areas for fiscal years 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 &#32;are included in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. 

Industry Overview: 

The hair salon market is highly fragmented, with the vast majority of locations independently owned and operated. However, the influence of salon chains, both franchised and company-owned, continues to grow within this market. Management believes salon chains will continue to have significant influence on this market and will continue to increase their presence. 

In every area in which the Company has a salon, there are competitors offering similar hair care services and products at similar prices. The Company faces competition from smaller chains of salons such as Great Clips, Fantastic Sams, and Sport Clips, independently owned salons, department store salons located within malls, booth rentals and blow dry bars. 

At the individual salon level, barriers to entry are low; however, barriers exist for chains to expand nationally due to the need to establish systems and infrastructure, to recruit experienced field and salon management and stylists, and to lease quality sites. The principal factors of competition in the hair care category are quality, consistency and convenience. The Company continually strives to improve its performance in each of these areas and to create additional points of differentiation versus the competition. 

Mission and Strategies: 

The Company's long-term mission is to create guests for life. To successfully achieve our mission and build a winning organization, we must be the place where stylists can have successful and satisfying careers, which will drive great guest experiences and in turn, guests for life. Our key strategies and priorities are well aligned, focusing on people, processes and metrics to drive execution and performance. Our key strategies follow: 

1. 

Earn the Hearts and Minds of Our Team 

2. 

Develop High Performing Leaders 

3. 

Attain Operational Excellence through Simplicity 

4. 

Achieve Each Salon's Potential 

5. 

Deliver Exceptional Guest Experiences 

Our stylists' ability to serve our guests in a professional, courteous, and friendly manner is the most critical element of our service model in cultivating strong guest relationships. Great stylists, coupled with high quality service, convenience, affordability, an inviting salon appearance and atmosphere, and comprehensive retail assortments create guests for life. We are committed to providing an outstanding guest experience that drives guest loyalty and repeat business. To that end, we are investing in a number of areas focused on delivering that promise and helping our stylists have successful careers, including investments in organization, training and technology. 

Stylists 

Creating an organization where stylists can have successful and satisfying careers leads to improved execution, and in turn, great guest experiences. 

Field Leadership. Our field leadership is organized to enable localized mentoring and decision making, improve geographic proximity and increase local market efficiency. Development of our field leaders is a high priority because stylists depend on their salons and field leaders for coaching, mentoring and motivation. Our training curriculum serves as the foundation for ongoing leadership development. Role clarity and talent assessments help us identify ways to develop and upgrade field leadership. Execution disciplines are used to drive accountability, execution and business performance. Incentives are designed to align field interests with those of the Company's shareholders by rewarding behaviors focused on profitable revenue growth. This organization structure also provides a clear career path for our people who desire to ascend within the Company. 

Technical Education. Our technical education program is becoming a key point of difference in attracting and retaining stylists. Stylists place a tremendous amount of importance in ongoing development of their craft. They deliver a superior experience for our guests when they are well trained technically and experientially. We employ technical trainers who provide new hire training for stylists joining the Company from beauty schools and training for all stylists in current beauty care and styling trends. We supplement internal training with targeted vendor training and external trainers who bring specialized expertise to our stylists. We utilize training materials to help all levels of field employees navigate the running of a salon and essential elements of guest service training within the context of brand positions. 

&#160; Recruiting. &#160; Ensuring we keep our salons fully staffed with great stylists is critical to our success. To that end, we continue to enhance our recruiting efforts across all levels within our organization. We cultivate a pipeline of field leaders through succession planning and recruitment venues from within and outside the salon industry. We also leverage beauty school relationships and participate in job fairs and industry events. 

Technology. Our point-of-sale (POS) systems and salon workstations throughout North America enable communication with salons and stylists, delivery of online and digital training to stylists, real-time salon level analytics on guest retention, wait times, stylist productivity, and salon performance. We also use technology to provide asset protection dashboards and analytics to help prioritize efforts against our most compelling opportunities to reduce loss in our salons. 

Guests 

Great stylists, coupled with high quality service, convenience, affordability, an inviting salon appearance and atmosphere, and comprehensive retail assortments, create guests for life. 

Convenience. Our different salon concepts enable our guests to select different service scheduling options based upon their preference. In the value category, the ability to serve walk-in appointments and minimize guest wait times is an essential element in delivering upon convenience. We continue to focus on staffing and retention, optimizing schedules and leveraging our POS systems to help us balance stylist hours with guest traffic and manage guest wait times. In the premium category, our salons generally schedule appointments in advance of service. Our salons are located in high-traffic strip centers, Walmart Supercenters and shopping malls, with guest parking and easy access, and are generally open seven days per week, offering guests a variety of convenient ways to fulfill their beauty needs. 

Affordability. The Company strives to offer an exceptional value for its services. In the value category, our guests expect outstanding service at affordable prices. These expectations are met with average service transactions ranging from $17 to $22. In the premium category, our guests expect upscale, full service beauty services at reasonable prices. Average service 

transactions approximate $47 in this category. Pricing decisions are considered on a salon level basis and established based on local conditions. 

Salon Appearance and Atmosphere. The Company's salons range from 500 to 5,000 square feet, with the typical salon approximating 1,200 square feet. Our salon repairs and maintenance program is designed to ensure we invest annually in salon cleanliness and safety, as well as in maintaining the normal operation of our salons. Our annual capital expenditures include funds to refresh the appeal and comfort of our salons. 

Retail Assortments. The Company's salons sell nationally recognized hair care and beauty products, as well as a complete assortment of own-brand products. Retail products offered by the Company are intended to be sold only through professional salons, and complement its salon services business. The Company's stylists are compensated and regularly trained to sell hair care and beauty products to their guests. Additionally, guests are encouraged to purchase products after stylists demonstrate their efficacy by using them in the styling of our guests' hair. The top selling brands within the Company's retail assortment include Paul Mitchell, Biolage, Regis designLINE, Redken, Nioxin, Sexy Hair Concepts, It's a 10, Kenra, Tigi, and Moroccanoil. 

Technology. Our POS systems have the ability to collect guest and transactional data and enable the Company to invest in guest relationship management, gaining insights into guest behavior, communicating with guests and incenting return visits. Leveraging this technology allows us to monitor guest retention and to survey our guests for feedback on improving the guest experience, and allows guests to use mobile apps to schedule appointments, view wait times and interact in other ways with salons. 

Marketing. We are focused on driving local traffic at the most efficient cost. This includes leveraging media, guest relationship management programs, digital channels, and local tactical efforts (e.g., couponing), among other programs. Traffic driving efforts are targeted vs. a one-size-fits all approach. Annual marketing plans are based on seasonality, consumer mindset, competitive positioning and return on investment. We continually reallocate marketing investments into vehicles with known, strong returns. 

Salon Support 

Our corporate headquarters is referred to as Salon Support. This acknowledges that creating guests for life mandates a service-oriented, stylist and guest-focused mentality in supporting our field organization to grow our business profitably. 

Organization. Salon Support and our associated priorities are aligned to our field structure to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the service provided to our field organization. During fiscal year 2014, we created a human resources organization to help transform the Company into the place where stylists can have successful and satisfying careers and enhanced our asset protection capabilities by building a strong asset protection team and establishing standard operating procedures to support field and salon leaders. 

Simplification. Our ongoing simplification efforts focus on improving the way we plan and execute across our many brands. Standardizing processes and procedures around scheduling, inventory management, day-to-day salon execution and reporting makes it easier to lead and execute in a multi-unit organization. Our organization also remains focused on identifying and driving cost saving and profit enhancing initiatives.

Salon Franchising Program: 

General. We have various franchising programs supporting our 2,496 &#32;franchised salons as of June 30, 2016 , consisting mainly of Supercuts, Cost Cutters, First Choice Haircutters, and Magicuts. These salons have been included in the discussions regarding salon counts and concepts. 

We provide our franchisees with a comprehensive system of business training, stylist education, site approval and lease negotiation, construction management services, professional marketing, promotion, and advertising programs, and other forms of support designed to help franchisees build successful businesses. 

Standards of Operations. The Company does not control the day-to-day operations of its franchisees, including employment, benefits and wage determination, establishing prices to charge for products and services, business hours, personnel management, and capital expenditure decisions. However, the franchise agreements afford certain rights to the Company, such as the right to approve locations, suppliers and the sale of a franchise. Additionally, franchisees are required to conform to the Company's established operational policies and procedures relating to quality of service, training, salon design and decor, and trademark usage. The Company's field personnel make periodic visits to franchised salons to ensure they are operating in conformity with the standards for each franchising program. All of the rights afforded to the Company with regard to franchised operations allow the Company to protect its brands, but do not allow the Company to control the franchise operations or make decisions that have a significant impact on the success of the franchised salons. The Company&#8217;s franchise agreements do not give the Company any right, ability or potential to determine or otherwise influence any terms and/or conditions of employment of franchisees&#8217; employees (except for those, if any, that are specifically related to quality of service, training, salon design, decor, and trademark usage), including, but not limited to, franchisees&#8217; employees&#8217; wages and benefits, 

hours of work, scheduling, leave programs, seniority rights, promotional or transfer opportunities, layoff/recall arrangements, grievance and dispute resolution procedures, uniforms, and/or discipline and discharge. 

Franchise Terms. Pursuant to a franchise agreement with the Company, each franchisee pays an initial fee for each store and ongoing royalties to the Company. In addition, for most franchise concepts, the Company collects advertising funds from franchisees and administers the funds on behalf of the concepts. Franchisees are responsible for the costs of leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, equipment, supplies, inventory, payroll costs and certain other items, including initial working capital. The majority of franchise agreements provide the Company a right of first refusal if the store is to be sold and the franchisee must obtain the Company's approval in all instances where there is a sale of a franchise location. 

Additional information regarding each of the major franchised brands is listed below: 

Supercuts 

Supercuts franchise agreements have a perpetual term, subject to termination of the underlying lease agreement or termination of the franchise agreement by either the Company or the franchisee. All new franchisees enter into development agreements, which give them the right to enter into a defined number of franchise agreements. These franchise agreements are site specific. The development agreement provides limited territorial protection for the stores developed under those franchise agreements. Older franchisees have grandfathered expansion rights which allow them to develop stores outside of development agreements and provide them with greater territorial protections in their markets. The Company has a comprehensive impact policy that resolves potential conflicts among Supercuts franchisees and/or the Company's Supercuts locations regarding proposed store sites. 

Cost Cutters, First Choice Haircutters, and Magicuts 

The majority of existing Cost Cutters franchise agreements have a 15 year term with a 15 year option to renew (at the option of the franchisee), while the majority of First Choice Haircutters franchise agreements have a ten year term with a five year option to renew. The majority of Magicuts franchise agreements have a term equal to the greater of five years or the current initial term of the lease agreement with an option to renew for two additional five year periods. The current franchise agreement is site specific. Franchisees may enter into development agreements with the Company which provide limited territorial protection. 

Franchisee Training. The Company provides new franchisees with training, focusing on the various aspects of salon management, including operations, personnel management, marketing fundamentals, and financial controls. Existing franchisees receive training, counseling and information from the Company on a continuous basis.

Salon Markets and Marketing: 

Company-Owned Salons 

The Company utilizes various marketing vehicles for its salons, including traditional advertising, guest relationship management, digital channels and promotional/pricing based programs. A predetermined allocation of revenue is used for such programs. Most marketing vehicles including radio, print, online, digital and television advertising are developed and supervised at the Company's Salon Support headquarters; however, the majority of advertising is created for our local markets. The Company reviews its brand strategy with the intent to create more clear communication platforms, identities and differentiation points for our brands to drive consumer preference. 

Franchised Salons 

Most franchise concepts maintain separate advertising funds that provide comprehensive marketing and sales support for each system. The Supercuts advertising fund is the Company's largest advertising fund and is administered by a council consisting of primarily franchisee representatives. The council has overall control of the advertising fund's expenditures and operates in accordance with terms of the franchise operating and other agreements. All stores, company-owned and franchised, contribute to the advertising funds, the majority of which are allocated to the contributing market for media placement and local marketing activities. The remainder is allocated for the creation of national advertising and system-wide activities. 

Affiliated Ownership Interests: 

The Company maintains ownership interests in beauty schools and salons. The primary ownership interest is a 54.6% interest in Empire Education Group, Inc. (EEG), which is accounted for as an equity method investment. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. EEG operates accredited cosmetology schools. Contributing the Company's beauty schools in fiscal 2008 to EEG leveraged EEG's management expertise, while enabling the Company to maintain a vested 

interest in the beauty school industry. Additionally, we utilize our EEG relationship to recruit stylists straight from beauty school. 

In addition, the Company has a 27.1% ownership interest in MY Style, which is accounted for as a cost method investment. MY Style operates salons in Japan. 

Corporate Trademarks: 

The Company holds numerous trademarks, both in the United States and in many foreign countries. The most recognized trademarks are "SmartStyle," "Supercuts," "MasterCuts," "Regis Salons," "Cost Cutters," "Hair Masters," "First Choice Haircutters," and "Magicuts." 

"Sassoon" is a registered trademark of Procter &#38; Gamble. The Company has a license agreement to use the Sassoon name for existing salons and academies and new salon development. 

Corporate Employees: 

During fiscal year 2016 , the Company had approximately 45,000 &#32;full and part-time employees worldwide, of which approximately 39,000 employees were located in the United States. None of the Company's employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and the Company believes its employee relations are amicable.

Governmental Regulations: 

The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and provincial laws affecting its business as well as a variety of regulatory provisions relating to the conduct of its beauty related business, including health and safety. 

In the United States, the Company's franchise operations are subject to the Federal Trade Commission's Trade Regulation Rule on Franchising (the FTC Rule) and by state laws and administrative regulations that regulate various aspects of franchise operations and sales. The Company's franchises are offered to franchisees by means of an offering circular/disclosure document containing specified disclosures in accordance with the FTC Rule and the laws and regulations of certain states. The Company has registered its offering of franchises with the regulatory authorities of those states in which it offers franchises and in which such registration is required. State laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and, in certain cases, apply substantive standards to this relationship. Such laws may, for example, require that the franchisor deal with the franchisee in good faith, may prohibit interference with the right of free association among franchisees and may limit termination of franchisees without payment of reasonable compensation. The Company believes that the current trend is for government regulation of franchising to increase over time. However, such laws have not had, and the Company does not expect such laws to have, a significant effect on the Company's operations. 

In Canada, the Company's franchise operations are subject to franchise laws and regulations in the provinces of Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. The offering of franchises in Canada occurs by way of a disclosure document, which contains certain disclosures required by the applicable provincial laws. The provincial franchise laws and regulations primarily focus on disclosure requirements, although each requires certain relationship requirements such as a duty of fair dealing and the right of franchisees to associate and organize with other franchisees. 

The Company believes it is operating in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing all of its operations. 

The Company maintains an ownership interest in EEG. Beauty schools derive a significant portion of their revenue from student financial assistance originating from the U.S. Department of Education's Title IV Higher Education Act of 1965. For the students to receive financial assistance at the school, the beauty schools must maintain eligibility requirements established by the U.S. Department of Education.
