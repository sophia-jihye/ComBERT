 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Radio One, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively, &#8220;Radio One,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and/or &#8220;us&#8221;) is an urban-oriented, multi-media company that primarily targets African-American and urban consumers. Our core business is our radio broadcasting franchise that is the largest radio broadcasting operation that primarily targets African-American and urban listeners. As of December 31, 2015, we owned and/or operated 56 broadcast stations located in 16 of the top 33 urban markets in the United States. While our primary source of revenue is the sale of local and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations, our strategy is to operate the premier multi-media entertainment and information content provider targeting African-American and urban consumers. Thus, we have diversified our revenue streams by making acquisitions and investments in other complementary media properties. Our other media interests include our approximately 99.6% controlling ownership interest in TV One, LLC (&#8220;TV One&#8221;), an African-American targeted cable television network; our 80.0% ownership interest in Reach Media, Inc. (&#8220;Reach Media&#8221;) which operates the Tom Joyner Morning Show and our other syndicated programming assets, including the Rickey Smiley Morning Show, the Yolanda Adams Morning Show, the Russ Parr Morning Show and the DL Hughley Show; and our ownership of Interactive One, LLC (&#8220;Interactive One&#8221;), our wholly owned online platform serving the African-American community through social content, news, information, and entertainment websites, including Global Grind (as defined in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Note 2 &#8211; Acquisitions and Dispositions ), News One, TheUrbanDaily and HelloBeautiful, and online social networking websites, including BlackPlanet and MiGente. In May 2014, the Company agreed to invest a minimum of $5 million up to a maximum of $40 million in MGM&#8217;s development of a world-class casino property, MGM National Harbor, located in Prince George&#8217;s County, Maryland. Upon completion of the project, currently anticipated to be in late 2016, this investment will further diversify our platform in the entertainment industry while still focusing on our core demographic. Through our national multi-media presence, we provide advertisers with a unique and powerful delivery mechanism to the African-American and urban audiences.

&#160;

Beginning November 1, 2012, our Columbus, Ohio radio station, WJKR-FM (The Jack, 98.9 FM) was made the subject of an LMA, and, on February 15, 2013, the Company sold that station&#8217;s assets. The results from operations of this station for the year ended December 31, 2013, has been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

&#160;

As of June 2011, our remaining Boston radio station was made the subject of a TBA whereby, similar in operation to an LMA, we have made available, for a fee, air time on this station to another party. In December 2013, we renegotiated the terms of the TBA, which now expires December 1, 2016, at which time the station will be conveyed. As a result, that station&#8217;s radio broadcasting license was classified as an other current asset as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and is being amortized through the anticipated conveyance date.

&#160;

As part of our consolidated financial statements, consistent with our financial reporting structure and how the Company currently manages its businesses, we have provided selected financial information on the Company&#8217;s four reportable segments: (i) radio broadcasting; (ii) Reach Media; (iii) internet; and (iv) cable television.

&#160;(1) WDNI-CD (formerly WDNI-LP), the low power television station that we operate in Indianapolis is not included in this table and constitutes the 56 th broadcast station. &#160;(2) Audience share data are for the 12+ demographic and derived from the Nielsen Survey ending with the Fall 2015 Nielsen Survey. &#160;(3) Population estimates are from the Nielsen Radio Market Survey Population, Rankings and Information, Fall 2015. &#160;(4) Richmond is the only market in which we operate using the diary methodology of audience measurement. &#160;(5) We retain ownership of a station in Boston; however, that station is the subject of a TBA and is not operated by us. Therefore, we do not subscribe to Nielsen for our Boston market.

The African-American Market Opportunity 

&#160;

We believe that urban-oriented media primarily targeting African-Americans continues as an attractive opportunity for the following reasons:

&#160;

African Americans Remain Heavy Consumers of Media . While radio is a maturing industry, radio consumption among African-Americans remains high. A recent survey indicates that 91% of all African-Americans &#8212; 31 million people &#8212;- tune into radio each week. On average, African-Americans listen to more radio relative to the total population at all age levels but particularly in the youngest and Baby Boomer age ranges. African-Americans aged 12-17 listen to an average of over 11% more hours of radio per month than does the total 12-17 population. Further, African-Americans aged 50-64 listen to an average of over 9% more hours of radio per month than the total 50-64 population. Indeed, African-Americans listen to the radio on average more than any other ethnic group, with African-Americans on average having more than 60 hours of radio listening time per month. Critical to advertisers, in the top 50 designated market areas, radio reaches on average each month 94% of African-Americans with a household income of $75,000 or more and 93% of African-Americans who are college graduates. (Source: &#8220;African-American Consumers: The Untold Story&#8221;, The Nielsen Company 2015.) African-Americans are also heavily engaged viewers of television - watching an average of nearly 52 hours per week. (Source: &#8220;Nielsen Total Audience Report, Quarter 1, 2015). Indeed, networks focused specifically on reaching the African-American audience, such as TV One, produce programming that accounts for 76% of the top 25 indexing programs for African-American adults. (Source: &#8220;Powerful, Growing, Influential. The African-American Consumer, 2014 Report,&#8221; Nielsen and Essence, 2014.)

&#160;

Steady African-American Population Growth. From 2000 to 2014, the nation&#8217;s African-American population grew at a 35% greater rate than the total population, and at more than double the 8.2% growth rate of the white population. By 2019, the nation&#8217;s African-American population is expected to increase 6%, exceeding the 4.4% growth expected of the general U.S. population by that year. By 2060, the African-American population will increase from 45.7 million to 74.5 million, and by that year African-Americans are expected to comprise almost 18% of the total U.S. population. (Source: &#8220;African-American Consumers: The Untold Story&#8221;, The Nielsen Company 2015.)

&#160;

High African-American Geographic Concentration. An analysis of the African-American population shows a high degree of geographic concentration. Indeed, according to recent census data, a bout 60% of African-Americans live in 10 states. The 10 states with the largest African-American populations in 2014 were New York (3.8 million), Texas (3.6 million), Florida (3.6 million), Georgia (3.3 million), California (3.0 million), North Carolina (2.3 million), Illinois (2.0 million), Maryland (1.9 million), Virginia (1.8 million) and Ohio (1.6 million). (Source: &#160; U.S. Census Bureau 2014 Estimate ). The practical implication of these findings is that a multi-media strategy within these pockets of geographic concentration can have a proportionately much more meaningful reach towards the African-American population than towards non-African-American U.S. populations. Indeed, the markets in which we operate radio stations are home in aggregate to 27% of the total African-American population. (Source: U.S. Census Bureau 2014 Estimate).

&#160;

Higher African-American Income Growth. The economic status of African-Americans has improved at an above-average rate over the past two decades. African-American buying power is expected to increase to over $1.3 trillion by 2017. In 2013, the nation&#8217;s share of total buying power that was African-American was 8.6%, up from 8.2% in 2000 and from 7.5% in 1990. African-American consumers&#8217; share of the nation&#8217;s total buying power will rise to 8.8% in 2018, accounting for almost nine cents out of every dollar that is spent. (Source: &#8220;The Multicultural Economy 2013,&#8221; Selig Center for Economic Growth, Terry College of Business, The University of Georgia, August 2013.) For the most recent available year (2013), African-American median household income increased 2.3% over the prior year compared to a 0.3% increase across total households. The percentage of African-American households that earned more than $50,000 per year increased from 30% in 2005 to 36% in 2013 and the percentage of African-American households that earned more than $75,000 per year increased from 15% in 2005 to 20% in 2013. But perhaps most impressive, between the years 2005 and 2013, the income bracket with the largest percentage increase for African-Americans occurred in households earning over $200,000 per year. The number of African-American households earning over $200,000 per year increased 138% in that timeframe compared with an increase of 74% for all households. (Source: U.S. Census, American Community Survey, 2014 Report.) Growth in African-American household income is anticipated to continue to increase at an outsize rate as a relatively larger portions of African-American join the workforce for the first time or move up from entry level jobs. This is particularly likely given the significantly younger median age of African-Americans, since this suggests that proportionately fewer African-Americans have reached their peak earning years. Further, African-Americans are increasingly educated. Indeed, the percentage of African-American high school graduates who enroll in college jumped to 70.9% for 2014 graduates from 59.3% in 2013, a rate that exceeded the 2014 67.3% college enrollment rate for non-Hispanic white high school graduates and the 68.4% enrollment rate for the total population. (Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2013-2014.)

&#160; 

Growing Influence of African-American Culture. The African-American population, on average, is younger than the average for the total U.S. population, with an average age of 31.4 years, compared to 39 years for the non-Hispanic White population and 37.7 years for the total population. Almost 30% of the African-American population is under the age of 18. Because of their relative youth and role as avid consumers African-Americans are also key influencers and creators of pop culture. (Source: &#8220;African-American Consumers: The Untold Story&#8221;, The Nielsen Company 2015.) Other demographic segments perceive Blacks as a driving force for popular culture: 73% of whites and 67% of Hispanics believe African-Americans influence mainstream American culture. (Source: &#8220;Resilient, Receptive and Relevant: The African-American Consumer,&#8221; Nielsen, 2013.) Further, we believe that there continues to be an ongoing &#8220;urbanization&#8221; of many facets of American society as evidenced by the influence of African-American culture in the areas of politics, music, film, fashion, sports and urban-oriented television shows and networks. We believe that many companies from a broad range of industries have embraced this urbanization trend in their products as well as in their advertising messages. Indeed, African-American celebrities are among the most well-known, influential personalities and trendsetter across the entertainment landscape. In music, Beyonce is one of the top three trendsetting artists in the pop genre, Will Smith is the third most widely recognized actor in film, Oprah Winfrey is viewed as the most influential media personality in television and Michael Jordan is the highest marketable celebrity in all of sports. (Source: Nielsen Entertainment, N-Score 2015.)

&#160;

Growth in Advertising Targeting the African-American Market. We continue to believe that large corporate advertisers are becoming more focused on reaching minority consumers in the United States. The African-American community is considered an emerging growth market within a mature domestic market. African-American consumers have behavior patterns distinguishable from those of the general market population. For example, African-Americans as a group are, relative to the total population, heavier consumers of media and shop more frequently. (Source: &#8220;Resilient, Receptive and Relevant: The African-American Consumer,&#8221; Nielsen, 2013.) We believe many large corporations are expanding their commitment to ethnic advertising. The companies that successfully market to the African-American audience have focused on building brand relationships. Advertisers are making an effort to fully understand African-American consumers, and to relate to them with messages that are relevant to their community. These advertisers are accomplishing this by visibly and consistently engaging the African-American consumer, involving themselves with the interests of the African-American consumer and increasing African-American brand loyalty. Using multiple platforms to reach African-American consumers is an effective marketing strategy as 62% of Blacks are likely to feel advertising content accessed via mobile phones and devices is useful. Fifty-three percent agreed that TV ads provided useful information about new products and services, while the respective percentages of Blacks that felt advertising accessed via other media was useful (newspapers (47%), magazines (46%), radio (39%), and internet (38%)) was similar to the percentages for the general population. (Source: &#8220;Powerful, Growing, Influential. The African-American Consumer, 2014 Report,&#8221; Nielsen and Essence, 2014.) In 2013, $2.6 billion was spent with media focused on African-American audiences, on cable television, national magazines, network television, spot radio, and syndicated television. This represented a 7 percent growth over 2012, compared to a 2% increase in overall advertising spending. While this growth in spending was a positive sign, it should be noted that this amount was only 2.6% of the total $69.3 billion companies spent advertising on these media platforms in 2013. (Source: &#8220;Powerful, Growing, Influential. The African-American Consumer, 2014 Report,&#8221; Nielsen and Essence, 2014.)

&#160;

Significant and Growing Internet Usage among African-Americans with Limited Targeted Online Content Offerings. African-American households outnumber each other ethnic (non-white) category of households as far as the number of households that reported using the internet. (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, May 2013, &#8220;Computer and Internet Use in the United States.&#8221;) The same factors driving increases in African-American buying power, such as improvements in education, incomes, and employment, are also increasing African-American internet usage. Further, African-Americans are heavy smartphone owners and users. Smartphone penetration is 83% among Black consumers compared to 75% for non-Hispanic Whites. African-American use the internet for many purposes, including entertainment, sports, dating, personal advancement and commerce. (Source: &#8220;African-American Consumers: The Untold Story&#8221;, The Nielsen Company 2015.)

Business Strategy 

&#160;

Radio Station Portfolio Optimization . Within our core radio business, our portfolio management strategy is to make select acquisitions of radio stations, primarily in markets where we already have a presence, and to divest stations which are no longer strategic in nature. Depending on market conditions, we may divest stations that do not have an urban format or stations located in smaller markets or markets where the African-American population is smaller, on a relative basis, than other markets in which we operate. Further, given market conditions, changes in ratings methodologies and economic and demographic shifts, from time to time, we may reprogram some of our stations in underperforming segments of certain markets. However, our core franchise remains targeted toward the African-American and/or urban listener and consumer. Through our portfolio management strategy, we are continually looking for opportunities to upgrade the performance of existing radio stations through reprogramming or by strengthening their signals to reach a larger number of potential listeners.

&#160;

Investment in Complementary Businesses . We continue to invest in complementary businesses in the media and entertainment industry. The primary focus of these investments will be on businesses that provide entertainment and information content to African-American and urban consumers. In April 2015, we increased our ownership interest in TV One, a cable television network targeting African-Americans, to 99.6% by buying the stake of our former partner Comcast Corporation (the remaining 0.4% being held by employees). In December 2014, we acquired certain assets of GG Digital, Inc., including the website and brand Global Grind. The Global Grind website and brand have been integrated into our online operations, as part of Interactive One, which includes the largest social networking site by members primarily targeted at African-Americans. Further, in May 2014, the Company agreed to invest in MGM&#8217;s development of a world-class casino property, MGM National Harbor, located in Prince George&#8217;s County, Maryland. Upon completion of the project, currently anticipated to be in late 2016, this investment will further diversify our platform in the entertainment industry while still focusing on our core demographic. The consolidation of Reach Media, TV One and Global Grind into our operations and our investment in MGM National Harbor are consistent with our operating strategy of becoming a multi-media entertainment and information content provider to African-American consumers. We believe that our unique position as a diversified media company focused on the African-American consumer provides us with a competitive advantage in these new businesses.

Multi-Media Operating Strategy 

&#160; 

To maximize net revenue and station operating income at our radio stations, we strive to achieve the largest audience share of African-American listeners in each market, convert these audience share ratings to advertising revenue, and control operating expenses. Complementing our core broadcast radio franchise are our syndicated radio, cable television, and online media interests. Through our national presence across our various media, we provide our customers with a multi-media advertising platform that is a unique and powerful delivery mechanism toward African-Americans and other urban consumers. We believe that as we continue to diversify into other media, the strength and effectiveness of this unique platform will become even more compelling. The success of our strategy relies on the following:

&#160;

&#183; market research and targeted programming and marketing; &#160;

&#183; ownership and syndication of programming content; &#160;

&#183; clustering, programming segmentation and sales bundling; &#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; strategic and coordinated sales, marketing and special event efforts; &#160;

&#183; strong management and performance-based incentives; and &#160;

&#183; significant community involvement. &#160; 

Market Research and Targeted Programming and Marketing 

&#160;

We use market research to tailor the programming, marketing and promotion of our radio stations and the content of our complementary media to maximize audience share. We also use our research to reinforce and refine our current programming and content, to identify unserved or underserved markets or segments within the African-American population and to determine whether to acquire new media properties or reprogram one of our existing media properties.

&#160;

We also seek to reinforce our targeted programming and content by creating a distinct and marketable identity for each of our media properties. To achieve this objective, in addition to our significant community involvement (discussed below), we employ and promote distinct, high-profile personalities across our media properties, many of whom have strong ties to the African-American community and the local communities in which a broadcasting property is located.

&#160;

Ownership and Syndication of Programming Content 

&#160;

To diversify our revenue base beyond the markets in which we physically operate, we seek to develop or acquire proprietary African-American targeted content. We distribute this content in a variety of ways, utilizing our own network of multi-media distribution assets or through distribution assets owned by others. If we distribute content through others, we are paid for providing this content or we receive advertising inventory which we monetize through our adverting sales. Our programming content efforts have included our investment in TV One and its related programming and the acquisition and development of our interactive brands including Global Grind, BlackPlanet, NewsOne, TheUrbanDaily and HelloBeautiful. Our efforts also include the development and distribution of several syndicated radio shows, including the Tom Joyner Morning Show, the Rickey Smiley Morning Show, the Yolanda Adams Morning Show, the Russ Parr Morning Show, and the DL Hughley Show. In addition to being broadcast on Radio One stations, our syndicated radio programming also was available on over 220 non-Radio One stations throughout the United States as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

Clustering, Programming Segmentation and Sales Bundling 

&#160;

We strive to build clusters of radio stations in our markets, with each radio station targeting different demographic segments of the African-American population. This clustering and programming segmentation strategy allows us to achieve greater penetration within the distinct segments of our overall target market. In a similar fashion, we have multiple online brands including Global Grind, BlackPlanet, NewsOne, TheUrbanDaily, and HelloBeautiful. Each of these brands focuses upon a different segment of African-American online users. With our radio station clusters and multiple online brands, we are able to direct advertisers to specific audiences within the urban communities in which we are located or to bundle the radio stations and brands for advertising sales purposes when advantageous.

&#160;

We believe there are several potential benefits that result from operating multiple radio stations within the same market as well as operating multiple online brands. First, each additional radio station in a market and online brand provides us with a larger percentage of the prime advertising time available for sale within that market and among online users. Second, the more stations we program and brands that we operate, the greater the market share we can achieve in our target demographic groups through the use of segmented programming and content delivery. Third, we are often able to consolidate sales, promotional, technical support and business functions across stations and brands to produce substantial cost savings. Finally, the purchase of additional radio stations in an existing market and the development of additional online brands allow us to take advantage of our market expertise and leverage our existing relationships with advertisers.

&#160;

Strategic and Coordinated Sales, Marketing and Special Event Efforts 

&#160;

We have assembled an effective, highly trained sales staff responsible for converting our broadcast and online audience shares into revenue. We operate with a focused, sales-oriented culture, which rewards aggressive selling efforts through a commission and bonus compensation structure. We hire and deploy large teams of sales professionals for each of our media properties or media clusters, and we provide these teams with the resources necessary to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate. We utilize various sales strategies to sell and market our properties on a stand-alone basis, in combination with other properties within a given market, and across our various media properties, where appropriate.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We have created a national platform of radio stations and syndicated programming in some of the largest African-American consumer markets. Our radio platform together with our syndicated programming platform has the ability to reach approximately 20 million listeners weekly, more than that of any other radio broadcaster primarily targeting African-Americans. Given the high degree of geographic concentration among the African-American population, national advertisers find advertising on our radio stations an efficient and cost-effective way to reach this target audience. Through integrated sales efforts, we bundle and sell our platform of radio stations to national advertisers, thereby enhancing our revenue generating opportunities, expanding our base of advertisers, creating greater demand for our advertising inventory, and increasing the capacity utilization of our inventory and making our sales efforts more efficient. We have also created a dedicated online sales force as part of our internet segment. Our leading advertising products, custom marketing solutions, and integrated inventory opportunities provide our advertising customers a unique vehicle to reach online African-American consumers at scale. To allow marketers to reach our audience across all of our platforms (radio, television, and online) in an efficient way, we offer &#8220;One Solution&#8221;, a cross-platform/brand sales and marketing effort which allows top tier advertisers to take full advantage of our complete suite of offerings through a one-stop shop approach that has the potential to reach approximately 80 percent of African-Americans in the United States.

&#160;

In order to create advertising loyalty, we strive to be the recognized expert in marketing to the African-American consumer in the markets in which we operate. We believe that we have achieved this recognition by focusing on serving the African-American consumer and by creating innovative advertising campaigns and promotional tie-ins with our advertising clients and sponsoring numerous entertainment events each year. In these events, advertisers buy sponsorships, signage, booth space, and/or broadcast promotions to sell a variety of goods and services to African-American consumers. As we expand our presence in our existing markets and into new markets, we may increase the number of events and the number of markets in which we host events based upon our evaluation of the financial viability and economic benefits of the events.

&#160;

Strong Management and Performance-Based Incentives 

&#160;

We focus on hiring and retaining highly motivated and talented individuals in each functional area of our organization who can effectively help us implement our growth and operating strategies. Our management team is comprised of a diverse group of individuals who bring significant expertise to their functional areas. To enhance the quality of our management in the areas of sales and programming, general managers, sales managers and program directors have significant portions of their compensation tied to the achievement of certain performance goals. General Managers&#8217; compensation is based partially on increasing market share and achieving station operating income benchmarks, which creates an incentive for management to focus on both sales growth and profitability. Additionally, sales managers and sales personnel have incentive packages based on sales goals, and program directors and on-air talent have incentive packages focused on maximizing ratings in specific target segments. Our One Solution sales approach seeks to drive incremental revenue and value across all of our media properties and includes performance based incentives for our sales team.

&#160;

Significant Community Involvement 

&#160;

We believe our active involvement and significant relationships in the African-American community across each of our brands and in each of our markets provide a competitive advantage in targeting African-American audiences and significantly improve the marketability of our advertising to businesses that are targeting such communities. We believe that a media property&#8217;s image should reflect the lifestyle and viewpoints of the target demographic group it serves. Due to our fundamental understanding of the African-American community, we are well positioned to identify music and musical styles, as well as political and social trends and issues, early in their evolution. This understanding is integrated into significant aspects of our operations across all of our media properties and enables us to create enhanced awareness and name recognition in the marketplace. In addition, we believe our approach to community involvement leads to increased effectiveness in developing and updating our programming formats and online brands and content which in turn leads to greater listenership and users of our online properties, driving higher ratings and online traffic over the long-term.

(1) Station was operating under a TBA as of December 31, 2014. The TBA expires December 31, 2019. &#160; &#160; (2) Richmond is the only market in which we operate using the diary methodology of audience measurement. &#160; &#160; (3) WXMG-FM and WJYD-FM began broadcasting under an LMA November 19, 2015: thus, ratings are not available. On February 3, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of these stations. &#160; &#160; (4) WDNI-CD (formerly WDNI-LP), the low power television station that we acquired in Indianapolis in June 2000, is not included in this table.

&#160;

Radio Advertising Revenue 

&#160;

For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 44.3% of our net revenue was generated from the sale of advertising in our core radio business, excluding Reach Media. Substantially all net revenue generated from our radio franchise is generated from the sale of local, national and network advertising. Local sales are made by the sales staff located in our markets. National sales are made primarily by Katz Communications, Inc. (&#8220;Katz&#8221;), a firm specializing in radio advertising sales on the national level. Katz is paid agency commissions on the advertising sold. Approximately 61.8% of our net revenue from our core radio business for the year ended December 31, 2015, was generated from the sale of local advertising and 33.3% from sales to national advertisers, including network advertising. Effective, January 1, 2013, we consolidated our syndication network programming within Reach Media to leverage that platform to create the leading syndicated radio network targeted to the African-American audience. The balance of net revenue from our radio segment is primarily derived from tower rental income, ticket sales, and revenue related to sponsored events, management fees and other revenue.

&#160;

Advertising rates charged by radio stations are based primarily on:

&#160;

&#183; a radio station&#8217;s audience share within the demographic groups targeted by the advertisers; &#160;

&#183; the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups; and &#160;

&#183; the supply and demand for radio advertising time. &#160;

A radio station&#8217;s listenership is measured by the Portable People Meter TM (the &#8220;PPM TM &#8221;) system or diary ratings surveys, both of which estimate the number of listeners tuned to a radio station and the time they spend listening to that radio station. Ratings are used by advertisers to evaluate whether to advertise on our radio stations, and are used by us to chart audience growth, set advertising rates and adjust programming. Advertising rates are generally highest during the morning and afternoon commuting hours.

&#160;

Strategic Diversification and Other Sources of Revenue 

&#160;

We have expanded our operations to include other media forms that are complementary to our core radio business. In December 2014, we acquired certain assets of GG Digital, Inc., including the website and brand Global Grind. The Global Grind website and brand have been integrated into our online operations as part of Interactive One, which includes the largest social networking site by members primarily targeted at African-Americans. Interactive One derives revenue from advertising services on non-radio station branded websites, and studio services where Interactive One provides services to other publishers. Advertising services include the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements. Advertising revenue is recognized either as impressions (the number of times advertisements appear in viewed pages) are delivered, when &#8220;click through&#8221; purchases are made, or ratably over the contract period, where applicable. In addition, Interactive One derives revenue from its studio operations which provide top-tier third-party clients with digital platforms and expertise. In the case of the studio operations, revenue is recognized primarily through fixed contractual monthly fees and/or as a share of the third party&#8217;s reported revenue. 

&#160; 

Reach Media primarily derives its revenue from the sale of advertising inventory in connection with its syndicated radio shows, including the Tom Joyner Morning Show and our other syndicated programming assets, including the Rickey Smiley Morning Show, the Yolanda Adams Morning Show, the Russ Parr Morning Show and the DL Hughley Show. Mr. Joyner is a leading nationally syndicated radio personality. As of December 31, 2015, the Tom Joyner Morning Show was broadcast on 94 affiliate stations across the United States and is a top-rated morning show in many of the markets in which it is broadcast. Reach Media operates www.BlackAmericaWeb.com, an African-American targeted website and also operates the Tom Joyner Family Reunion and various other special event-related activities. 

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In January 2004, the Company, together with an affiliate of Comcast Corporation and other investors, launched TV One, a cable television network featuring lifestyle, entertainment and news-related programming targeted primarily towards African-American viewers. In April 2011, we increased our ownership interest in TV One to 50.9% giving us a controlling interest in the network. Since April 2011, our ownership in TV One has increased to approximately 99.6% after redemptions of certain management interests and, most recently, through our acquisition of Comcast&#8217;s interest in April 2015.

&#160;

We have launched websites that simultaneously stream radio station content for each of our radio stations, and we derive revenue from the sale of advertisements on those websites. We generally encourage our web advertisers to run simultaneous radio campaigns and use mentions in our radio airtime to promote our websites. By providing streaming, we have been able to broaden our listener reach, particularly to &#8220;office hour&#8221; listeners. We believe streaming has had a positive impact on our radio stations&#8217; reach to listeners. In addition, our station websites link to our other online properties operated by Interactive One acting as traffic sources for these online brands.

&#160;

Future opportunities could include investments in, or acquisitions of, companies in diverse media businesses, gaming and entertainment, music production and distribution, movie distribution, internet-based services, and distribution of our content through emerging distribution systems such as the Internet, smartphones, cellular phones, tablets, and the home entertainment market.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

The media industry is highly competitive and we face intense competition across core radio franchise and all of our complementary media properties, including our internet segment. Our media properties compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other radio stations and with other media such as broadcast and cable television, the Internet, satellite radio, newspapers, magazines, direct mail and, outdoor advertising, some of which may be controlled by horizontally-integrated companies. Audience ratings and advertising revenue are subject to change and any adverse change in a market could adversely affect our net revenue in that market. If a competing station converts to a format similar to that of one of our stations, or if one of our competitors strengthens its signal or operations, our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and advertising revenue. Other media companies which are larger and have more resources may also enter or increase their presence in markets or segments in which we operate. Although we believe our media properties are well positioned to compete, we cannot assure that our properties will maintain or increase their current ratings, market share or advertising revenue.

&#160; 

The radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies, which may impact our business. We cannot assure that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies. Several new media technologies are being, or have been, developed including the following:

&#160; 

&#183; satellite delivered digital audio radio service with expansive choice, high sound quality, and availability on portable devices and in automobiles; &#160;

&#183; audio programming by internet companies, cable television systems, and direct broadcast satellite systems; and &#160;

&#183; digital audio and video content available for listening and/or viewing on the Internet and/or available for downloading to portable devices. &#160; 

Along with most other public radio companies, we have invested in iBiquity, a developer of digital audio broadcast technology. In connection with the investment we committed to convert most of our analog broadcast radio stations to in-band, on-channel digital radio broadcasts, which could provide multi-channel, multi-format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional AM and FM radio services. However, we cannot assure that these arrangements will be successful or enable us to adapt effectively to these new media technologies.

&#160;

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our internet segment competes for the time and attention of internet users and, thus, advertisers and advertising revenues with a wide range of internet companies such as Yahoo! TM , Google TM , and Microsoft TM and social networking sites such as Facebook TM and traditional media companies, which are increasingly offering their own internet products and services. The Internet is dynamic and rapidly evolving, and new and popular competitors, such as social networking sites, frequently emerge and/or are fragmented by new and evolving technologies.

&#160; 

Antitrust Regulation 

&#160;

The agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws, the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) and the Department of Justice (&#8220;DOJ&#8221;), may investigate acquisitions. The DOJ has challenged a number of media property transactions. Some of those challenges ultimately resulted in consent decrees requiring, among other things, divestitures of certain media properties. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific DOJ or FTC review of a particular acquisition.

&#160; 

For acquisitions meeting certain size thresholds, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act requires the parties to file Notification and Report Forms concerning antitrust issues with the DOJ and the FTC and to observe specified waiting period requirements before completing the acquisition. If the investigating agency raises substantive issues in connection with a proposed transaction, the parties involved frequently engage in lengthy discussions and/or negotiations with the investigating agency to address those issues, including restructuring the proposed acquisition or divesting assets. In addition, the investigating agency could file suit in federal court to enjoin the acquisition or to require the divestiture of assets, among other remedies. All acquisitions, regardless of whether they are required to be reported under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, may be investigated by the DOJ or the FTC under the antitrust laws before or after completion. In addition, private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws. The DOJ has stated publicly that it believes that local marketing agreements, joint sales agreements, time brokerage agreements and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station transfers could violate the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act if such agreements take effect prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

&#160; 

Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting 

&#160;

The radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing regulation by the FCC and other federal agencies of ownership, programming, technical operations, employment and other business practices. The FCC regulates radio broadcast stations pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Communications Act&#8221;). The Communications Act permits the operation of radio broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of a license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. Among other things, the FCC:

&#160; 

&#183; assigns frequency bands for radio broadcasting; &#160;

&#183; determines the particular frequencies, locations, operating power, interference standards, and other technical parameters for radio broadcast stations; &#160;

&#183; issues, renews, revokes and modifies radio broadcast station licenses; &#160;

&#183; imposes annual regulatory fees and application processing fees to recover its administrative costs; &#160;

&#183; establishes technical requirements for certain transmitting equipment to restrict harmful emissions; &#160;

&#183; adopts and implements regulations and policies that affect the ownership, operation, program content, employment, and business practices of radio broadcast stations; and &#160;

&#183; has the power to impose penalties, including monetary forfeitures, for violations of its rules and the Communications Act. &#160;

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of an FCC license, or transfer of control of an FCC licensee, without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to grant or renew a radio broadcast license or consent to assignment or transfer of a license, the FCC considers a number of factors, including restrictions on foreign ownership, compliance with FCC media ownership limits and other FCC rules, the character and other qualifications of the licensee (or proposed licensee) and compliance with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. A licensee&#8217;s failure to comply with the requirements of the Communications Act or FCC rules and policies may result in the imposition of sanctions, including admonishment, fines, the grant of a license renewal for less than a full eight-year term or with conditions, denial of a license renewal application, the revocation of an FCC license, and/or the denial of FCC consent to acquire additional broadcast properties.

&#160; 

Congress, the FCC and, in some cases, local jurisdictions, are considering or may in the future consider and adopt new laws, regulations and policies that could affect the operation, ownership and profitability of our radio stations, result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenue for our radio broadcast stations or affect our ability to acquire additional radio broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions. Such matters include or may include:

&#160; 

&#183; changes to the license authorization and renewal process; &#160;

&#183; proposals to increase record keeping, including enhanced disclosure of stations&#8217; efforts to serve the public interest; &#160;

&#183; proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on FCC licensees; &#160;

&#183; changes to rules relating to political broadcasting, including proposals to grant free air time to candidates, and other changes regarding political and non-political program content, political advertising rates and sponsorship disclosures; &#160;

&#183; proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of beer, wine, and other alcoholic beverages; &#160;

&#183; revised rules and policies regarding the regulation of the broadcast of indecent content; &#160;

&#183; proposals to increase the actions stations must take to demonstrate service to their local communities; &#160;

&#183; technical and frequency allocation matters; &#160;

&#183; changes in broadcast multiple ownership, foreign ownership, cross-ownership and ownership attribution policies; &#160;

&#183; changes to allow satellite radio operators to insert local content into their programming service; &#160;

&#183; service and technical rules for digital radio, including possible additional public interest requirements for terrestrial digital audio broadcasters; &#160;

&#183; legislation that would provide for the payment of sound recording royalties to artists, musicians or record companies whose music is played on terrestrial radio stations; and &#160;

&#183; proposals to alter provisions of the tax laws affecting broadcast operations and acquisitions. &#160;

The FCC also has adopted procedures for the auction of broadcast spectrum in circumstances where two or more parties have filed mutually exclusive applications for authority to construct new stations or certain major changes in existing stations. Such procedures may limit our efforts to modify or expand the broadcast signals of our stations.

&#160;

We cannot predict what changes, if any, might be adopted or considered in the future, or what impact, if any, the implementation of any particular proposals or changes might have on our business.

&#160; 

FCC License Grants and Renewals. In making licensing determinations, the FCC considers an applicant&#8217;s legal, technical, financial and other qualifications. The FCC grants radio broadcast station licenses for specific periods of time and, upon application, may renew them for additional terms. A station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a timely filed license renewal application is pending. Under the Communications Act, radio broadcast station licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years.

&#160; 

&#160; 18 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Generally, the FCC renews radio broadcast licenses without a hearing upon a finding that:

&#160; 

&#183; the radio station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; &#160;

&#183; there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations; and &#160;

&#183; there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse. &#160;

After considering these factors and any petitions to deny a license renewal application (which may lead to a hearing), the FCC may grant the license renewal application with or without conditions, including renewal for a term less than the maximum otherwise permitted. Historically, our licenses have been renewed for full eight-year terms without any conditions or sanctions imposed; however, there can be no assurance that the licenses of each of our stations will be renewed for a full term without conditions or sanctions.

&#160; 

&#160; Types of FCC Broadcast Licenses. The FCC classifies each AM and FM radio station. An AM radio station operates on either a clear channel, regional channel or local channel. A clear channel serves wide areas, particularly at night. A regional channel serves primarily a principal population center and the contiguous rural areas. A local channel serves primarily a community and the suburban and rural areas immediately contiguous to it. Class A, B and C radio stations each operate unlimited time. Class A radio stations render primary and secondary service over an extended area. Class B radio stations render service only over a primary service area. Class C radio stations render service only over a primary service area that may be reduced as a consequence of interference. Class D radio stations operate either during daytime hours only, during limited times only, or unlimited time with low nighttime power.

&#160; 

FM class designations depend upon the geographic zone in which the transmitter of the FM radio station is located. The minimum and maximum facilities requirements for an FM radio station are determined by its class. In general, commercial FM radio stations are classified as follows, in order of increasing power and antenna height: Class A, B1, C3, B, C2, C1, C0 and C. The FCC has adopted a rule subjecting Class C FM stations that do not satisfy a certain antenna height requirement to an involuntary downgrade in class to Class C0 under certain circumstances.

&#160; &#160; 

Radio One&#8217;s Licenses. The following table sets forth information with respect to each of our radio stations for which we own the license as of December 31, 2015. Stations which we do not own as of December 31, 2015, but operate under an LMA, are not reflected on this table. A broadcast station&#8217;s market may be different from its community of license. The coverage of an AM radio station is chiefly a function of the power of the radio station&#8217;s transmitter, less dissipative power losses and any directional antenna adjustments. For FM radio stations, signal coverage area is chiefly a function of the ERP of the radio station&#8217;s antenna and the HAAT of the radio station&#8217;s antenna. &#8220;ERP&#8221; refers to the effective radiated power of an FM radio station. &#8220;HAAT&#8221; refers to the antenna height above average terrain of an FM radio station.

To obtain the FCC&#8217;s prior consent to assign or transfer control of a broadcast license, an appropriate application must be filed with the FCC. If the assignment or transfer involves a substantial change in ownership or control of the licensee, for example, the transfer or acquisition of more than 50% of the voting stock, the applicant must give public notice and the application is subject to a 30-day period for public comment. During this time, interested parties may file petitions with the FCC to deny the application. Informal objections may be filed at any time until the FCC acts upon the application. If the FCC grants an assignment or transfer application, administrative procedures provide for petitions seeking reconsideration or full FCC review of the grant. The Communications Act also permits the appeal of a contested grant to a federal court.

&#160;

Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by any persons who are not U.S. citizens or by any entity that has more than 20% of its capital stock owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. entities. The Communications Act prohibits indirect foreign ownership or control through a parent company of the licensee of more than 25% if the FCC determines the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of such license. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before this 25% limit may be exceeded, and the FCC has made such an affirmative finding only in limited circumstances. Since we serve as a holding company for subsidiaries that serve as licensees for our stations, we are effectively restricted from having more than one-fourth of our stock owned or voted directly or indirectly by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, foreign governments, representatives of foreign governments, or foreign business entities. In November 2013, the FCC clarified that it would entertain and authorize, on a case-by-case basis and upon a sufficient public interest showing, proposals to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcast licensees. In October 2015, the FCC proposed rules to simplify and streamline the process for requesting authority to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit and solicited public comment on related matters, such as revising the methodology that broadcasters may use to assess their compliance with the 25% limit.

&#160;

The FCC generally applies its media ownership limits to &#8220;attributable&#8221; interests. The interests of officers, directors and those who directly or indirectly hold five percent or more of the total outstanding voting stock of a corporation that holds a broadcast license (or a corporate parent) are generally deemed attributable interests, as are any limited partnership or limited liability company interests that are not properly &#8220;insulated&#8221; from management activities. Certain passive investors that hold stock for investment purposes only may hold attributable interests with the ownership of 20% or more of the voting stock of a licensee or parent corporation. An entity with one or more radio stations in a market that enters into a local marketing agreement or a time brokerage agreement with another radio station in the same market obtains an attributable interest in the brokered radio station, if the brokering station supplies more than 15% of the brokered radio station&#8217;s weekly broadcast hours. Similarly, a radio station licensee&#8217;s right under a joint sales agreement (&#8220;JSA&#8221;) to sell more than 15% per week of the advertising time on another radio station in the same market constitutes an attributable ownership interest in such station for purposes of the FCC&#8217;s ownership rules. Debt instruments, non-voting stock, unexercised options and warrants, minority voting interests in corporations having a single majority shareholder, and limited partnership or limited liability company membership interests where the interest holder is not &#8220;materially involved&#8221; in the media-related activities of the partnership or limited liability company pursuant to FCC-prescribed &#8220;insulation&#8221; provisions, generally do not subject their holders to attribution unless such interests implicate the FCC&#8217;s equity-debt-plus (or &#8220;EDP&#8221;) rule. Under the EDP rule, a major programming supplier or a same-market media entity will have an attributable interest in a station if the supplier or same-market media entity also holds debt or equity, or both, in the station that is greater than 33% of the value of the station&#8217;s total debt plus equity. For purposes of the EDP rule, equity includes all stock, whether voting or nonvoting, and interests held by limited partners or limited liability company members that are &#8220;insulated&#8221; from material involvement in the company&#8217;s media activities. A major programming supplier is any supplier that provides more than 15% of the station&#8217;s weekly programming hours.

&#160; 

The Communications Act and FCC rules generally restrict ownership, operation or control of, or the common holding of attributable interests in:

&#160; 

&#183; radio broadcast stations above certain numerical limits serving the same local market; &#160;

&#183; radio broadcast stations combined with television broadcast stations above certain numerical limits serving the same local market (radio/television cross ownership); and &#160;

&#183; a radio broadcast station and an English-language daily newspaper serving the same local market (newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership). &#160; 

The media ownership rules are subject to periodic review by the FCC. In 2003, the FCC, among other actions, adopted new rules to change the way a local radio market is defined and to make JSAs involving more than 15% of a same-market radio station&#8217;s weekly advertising time &#8220;attributable&#8221; under the ownership limits. The FCC grandfathered existing combinations of radio stations that would not comply with the modified rules. However, the FCC ruled that such noncompliant combinations could not be sold intact except to certain &#8220;eligible entities,&#8221; which the agency defined as entities qualifying as a small business consistent with Small Business Administration standards. The 2003 rules were challenged in court and the Third Circuit stayed their implementation, among other things, on the basis that the FCC did not adequately justify its radio ownership limits. Subsequently, the Third Circuit partially lifted its stay to allow the new local market definition, JSA attribution and grandfathering rules to go into effect. The FCC currently is applying such revisions (except for the &#8220;eligible entity&#8221; exception to the prohibition on the sale of noncompliant grandfathered combinations, which the Third Circuit remanded to the FCC for further consideration) to pending and new applications.

&#160;

The numerical limits on radio stations that one entity may own in a local market are as follows:

&#160; 

&#183; in a radio market with 45 or more commercial radio stations, a party may hold an attributable interest in up to eight commercial radio stations, not more than five of which are in the same service (AM or FM); &#183; in a radio market with 30 to 44 commercial radio stations, a party may hold an attributable interest in up to seven commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service (AM or FM); &#183; in a radio market with 15 to 29 commercial radio stations, a party may hold an attributable interest in up to six commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service (AM or FM); and &#183; in a radio market with 14 or fewer commercial radio stations, a party may hold an attributable interest in up to five commercial radio stations, not more than three of which are in the same service (AM or FM), except that a party may not hold an attributable interest in more than 50% of the radio stations in such market. &#160; 

To apply these tiers, the FCC currently relies on Nielsen Metro Survey Areas, where they exist. In other areas, the FCC relies on a contour-overlap methodology. The FCC has initiated a rulemaking to determine how to define local radio markets in areas located outside Nielsen Metro Survey Areas. The market definition used by the FCC in applying its ownership rules may not be the same as that used for purposes of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

&#160; 

In its 2003 media ownership decision, the FCC adopted new cross-media limits to replace the newspaper-broadcast and radio-television cross-ownership rules. These provisions were stayed by the Third Circuit and remanded by the court for further FCC consideration. In 2006, the FCC began its next periodic review, which addressed issues on remand from the Third Circuit. That review culminated in a 2007 decision in which the FCC revised the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule to allow a degree of same-market newspaper/broadcast ownership based on certain presumptions, criteria and limitations, but made no changes to the currently effective local radio ownership rules (as modified in 2003) or the radio/television cross-ownership rule (as modified in 1999). In July 2011, ruling on various appeals of the FCC&#8217;s 2007 decision, the Third Circuit vacated the FCC&#8217;s revisions to the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule, vacated the FCC&#8217;s definition of &#8220;eligible entity&#8221; in connection with various rules designed to increase diversity of broadcast ownership, and otherwise upheld the FCC&#8217;s decision to retain the current radio ownership and radio-television cross-ownership rules. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the Third Circuit&#8217;s decision.

&#160; 

The FCC began its most recent review of its media ownership rules in March 2014, adopting a further notice of proposed rulemaking that incorporates the record of its uncompleted 2010 review. The FCC proposes once again to permit newspaper-television cross-ownership in certain circumstances, and additionally proposes to eliminate the radio-television cross-ownership rule and the prohibition on newspaper-radio cross-ownership, but proposes no significant changes to the existing rules governing local radio ownership.

&#160;

The attribution and media ownership rules limit the number of radio stations we may acquire or own in any particular market and may limit the prospective buyers of any stations we want to sell. The FCC&#8217;s rules could affect our business in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, the following:

&#160; 

&#183; enforcement of a more narrow market definition based upon Nielsen markets could have an adverse effect on our ability to accumulate stations in a given area or to sell a group of stations in a local market to a single entity; &#183; restricting the assignment and transfer of control of radio combinations that exceed the new ownership limits as a result of the revised local market definitions could adversely affect our ability to buy or sell a group of stations in a local market from or to a single entity; and &#183; in general terms, future changes in the way the FCC defines radio markets or in the numerical station caps could limit our ability to acquire new stations in certain markets, our ability to operate stations pursuant to certain agreements, and our ability to improve the coverage contours of our existing stations. &#160;

Programming and Operations. The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the &#8220;public interest&#8221; by presenting programming that responds to community problems, needs and interests and by maintaining records demonstrating its responsiveness. The FCC considers complaints from viewers or listeners about a broadcast station&#8217;s programming, and the station is required to maintain letters and emails it receives from the public regarding station operation on public file for three years. In January 2016, the FCC adopted rules requiring that radio stations post and maintain their public inspection files online. The rules require that stations upload their files into an FCC-maintained database that will display the contents of each station&#8217;s file to the public. Moreover, the FCC has proposed rules designed to increase local programming content and diversity, including renewal application processing guidelines for locally-oriented programming and a requirement that broadcasters establish advisory boards in the communities where they own stations. Stations also must follow FCC rules and policies regulating political advertising, obscene or indecent programming, sponsorship identification, contests and lotteries and technical operation, including limits on human exposure to radio frequency radiation. 

&#160;

The FCC&#8217;s rules prohibit a broadcast licensee, in certain circumstances, from simulcasting more than 25% of its programming on another radio station in the same broadcast service (that is, AM/AM or FM/FM). The simulcasting restriction applies if the licensee owns both radio broadcast stations or owns one and programs the other through a local marketing agreement, and only if the contours of the radio stations overlap in a certain manner.

&#160; 

The FCC requires that licensees not discriminate in hiring practices on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin or gender. It also requires stations with at least five full-time employees to broadly disseminate information about all full-time job openings and undertake outreach initiatives from an FCC list of activities such as participation in job fairs, internships, or scholarship programs. The FCC is considering whether to apply these recruitment requirements to part-time employment positions. Stations must retain records of their outreach efforts and keep an annual Equal Employment Opportunity (&#8220;EEO&#8221;) report in their public inspection files and post an electronic version on their websites. Radio stations with more than 10 full-time employees must file certain EEO reports with the FCC midway through their license term.

&#160; 

From time to time, complaints may be filed against any of our radio stations alleging violations of these or other rules. In addition, the FCC may conduct audits or inspections to ensure and verify licensee compliance with FCC rules and regulations. Failure to observe these or other rules and regulations can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including fines or conditions, the grant of &#8220;short&#8221; (less than the maximum eight year) renewal terms or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application or the revocation of a license.
