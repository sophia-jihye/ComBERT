Competition 

We are subject to competition in substantially all product and service areas. Some of our key competitors are: 

&#160; &#149; 

&#160; Aerospace: Borg-Warner (automotive), Garmin, General Electric, Rockwell Collins, Thales and United Technologies 

&#160; &#149; 

&#160; ACS: 3M, Johnson Controls, Schneider, Siemens and Zebra-Motorola 

&#160; &#149; 

&#160; PMT: Albemarle, BASF, Dow, Dupont, Emerson and Sinopec 

Our businesses compete on a variety of factors, such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of OEMs. 

Aerospace Sales 

Our sales to aerospace customers were 39%, 39%, and 40% of our total sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Our sales to commercial aerospace OEMs were 8%, 6%, and 7% of our total sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013. In addition, our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 12%, 11%, and 11% of our total sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

U.S. Government Sales 

Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by Aerospace), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $3,743 million, $3,693 million and $3,856 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a prime contractor and subcontractor, of $2,680 million, $2,792 million and $3,066 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. U.S. defense spending decreased in 2015 compared to 2014. We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2016 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEMs&#146; production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs), increases in direct foreign defense and space market sales, as well as our diversified commercial businesses. 

&#160;

Backlog 

Our total backlog at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $18,183 million and $18,313 million. We anticipate that approximately $11,601 million of the 2015 backlog will be filled in 2016. We believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer&#146;s option. 

International Operations 

We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development globally. U.S. exports and non-U.S. manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 14% of our total sales in each of 2015, 2014 and 2013. Non-U.S. manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 39% of our total sales in 2015, and 41% in 2014 and 2013.

Raw Materials 

The principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available. Although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply, we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2015. We are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials, except related to R240 (a key component in foam blowing agents), a raw material used in PMT. 

The costs of certain key raw materials, including cumene, natural gas, R240, sulfur, fluorspar, ethylene and perchloroethylene in PMT and nickel, steel, titanium and other metals in Aerospace, are expected to continue to fluctuate. We will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2016. 

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights 

Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business. 

Research and Development 

The Company&#146;s principal research and development activities are in the U.S., India, Europe and China. Research and development (R&#38;D) expense totaled $1,856 million, $1,892 million and $1,804 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. R&#38;D expense was 5% of sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Customer-sponsored (principally by the U.S. Government) R&#38;D activities amounted to an additional $998 million, $1,034 million and $969 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

Environment 

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental 

&#160;

damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. 

We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is also possible that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. 

Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#146;s National Priority List. Although there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, to date we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole. 

We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Company&#146;s business or markets that it serves, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. 

Employees 

We have approximately 129,000 employees at December 31, 2015, of whom approximately 49,000 are located in the United States.
