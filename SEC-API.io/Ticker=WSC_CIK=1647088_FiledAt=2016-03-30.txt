 Item 1. Business. 

&#160;

Introduction 

&#160;

We are a blank check company incorporated on June 26, 2015 as a Cayman Islands exempted company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have reviewed, and continue to review, a number of opportunities to enter into a business combination, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete a business combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or with any other target business. We also have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a &#8220;shell company&#8221; as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.

&#160;

On September 16, 2015, we consummated our initial public offering (the &#8220;Public Offering&#8221;) of 50,000,000 units, including the issuance of 2,000,000 units as a result of the underwriters&#8217; partial exercise of their over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one warrant. Each warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one Class A ordinary share at a price of $5.75 per one-half share ($11.50 per whole share). The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds, before expenses, of $500,000,000. Prior to the consummation of the Public Offering, on July 1, 2015, the Sponsor purchased 12,218,750 Class B ordinary shares (the &#8220;founder shares&#8221;) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.002 per share. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that the Public Offering would be 42,500,000 units and therefore that such founder shares would represent, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the outstanding Class A ordinary shares under the Public Offering. On July 29, 2015, the Sponsor transferred 6,109,375 founder shares to Harry E. Sloan for a purchase price of $12,500 (the same per share purchase price initially paid by the Sponsor). On August 27, 2015, the Sponsor and Mr. Sloan transferred an aggregate of 25,000 founder shares on a pro rata basis to each of our independent directors at their original purchase price. On August 27, 2015, Mr. Sloan transferred 665,500 founder shares to the Sponsor. On September 10, 2015, we effected a share capitalization of approximately .129 shares for each outstanding Class B ordinary share, resulting in our initial shareholders holding an aggregate of 13,800,000 founder shares. Following the Public Offering, an aggregate of 1,300,000 of the founder shares (consisting of 1,271,771 shares held by the Sponsor, an aggregate of 9,705 shares held by our independent directors and 18,524 shares held by Mr. Sloan) were surrendered to us for no consideration due to the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option.

&#160;

Simultaneously with the consummation of the Public Offering, we consummated the private sale of an aggregate of 19,500,000 warrants, each exercisable to purchase one-half of one Class A ordinary share at $5.75 per one-half share ($11.50 per whole share), to the Sponsor, Harry E. Sloan and the Company&#8217;s independent directors (and/or one or more of their estate planning vehicles) at a price of $0.50 per warrant, generating gross proceeds, before expenses, of $9,750,000 (the &#8220;Private Placement&#8221;). The warrants sold in the Private Placement, or the private placement warrants, are identical to the warrants included in the units sold in the Public Offering, except that, so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, (i) they will not be redeemable by the Company, (ii) they (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the Company completes its initial business combination and (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis.

&#160;

Upon the closing of the Public Offering and the Private Placement, $500,000,000 was placed in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer &#38; Trust Company acting as trustee (the &#8220;Trust Account&#8221;). Except for the withdrawal of interest to pay income taxes, if any, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that none of the funds held in trust will be released from the Trust Account until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial business combination or (ii) the redemption of the Company&#8217;s public shares if the Company is unable to complete a business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Public Offering, subject to applicable law. The proceeds held in the Trust Account may only be invested in United States &#8220;government securities&#8221; within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;), having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.

&#160;

After the payment of underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the deferred portion of $19,500,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions, which amount will be payable upon consummation of our initial business combination if consummated) and approximately $790,000 in expenses relating to the Public Offering, approximately $1,000,000 of the net proceeds of the Public Offering and Private Placement was not deposited into the Trust Account and was retained by us for working capital purposes. The net proceeds deposited into the Trust Account remain on deposit in the Trust Account earning interest. As of December 31, 2015, there was $500,089,682 in investments and cash held in the Trust Account and $1,007,861 of cash held outside the Trust Account available for working capital purposes. As of December 31, 2015, no funds had been withdrawn from the Trust Account for taxes.

&#160;

Effecting our initial business combination 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash held in the Trust Account, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.

&#160;

If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

&#160;

Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination 

&#160;

While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business industry or sector, we intend to focus on identifying a business combination opportunity in industries or sectors that complement our management team&#8217;s background, and to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire and operate a business, focusing on the media and entertainment sectors in the United States or globally. We believe our management team is well positioned to take advantage of the growing set of investment opportunities focused in the media and entertainment sectors, to create value for our shareholders, and that our contacts and sources, ranging from owners of private and public companies, private equity funds, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and business brokers in these sectors will allow us to generate attractive acquisition opportunities. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association prohibit us from effectuating a business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations.

&#160;

Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses even if the acquisitions of the target businesses are not closed simultaneously.

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.

&#160;

The time required to evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. Prior to our initial business combination, we will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our business combination.

&#160;

Redemption rights for holders of public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination 

&#160;

We will provide our shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares sold as part of the units sold in the Public Offering (the &#8220;public shares&#8221;) upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest, less income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may acquire during or after the Public Offering in connection with the completion of our business combination.

&#160;

Conduct of redemptions pursuant to tender offer rules 

&#160;

If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;), we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.

&#160;

Submission of our initial business combination to a stockholder vote 

&#160;

In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.

&#160;

If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after the Public Offering in favor of our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.

&#160;

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, other than as expressly stated herein, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public &#8220;float&#8221; of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.

&#160;

Limitation on redemption rights upon completion of our initial business combination if we seek stockholder approval 

&#160;

Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a &#8220;group&#8221; (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the Public Offering. We believe the restriction described above will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder&#8217;s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders&#8217; ability to redeem to no more than 20% of the shares sold in the Public Offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders&#8217; ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those shareholders that hold more than 20% of the shares sold in the Public Offering) for or against our business combination.

&#160;

Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination 

&#160;

The Sponsor, our executive officers and directors have agreed that we will have only 24 months from the closing of the Public Offering to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such 24-month period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), less income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders&#8217; rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 24-month time period.

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.

&#160;

Available Information 

&#160;

We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control, acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The public may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC&#8217;s Internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov .
