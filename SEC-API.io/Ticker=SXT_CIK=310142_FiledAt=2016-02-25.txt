&#160;

Asia Pacific Group

The Asia Pacific Group focuses on marketing the Company&#8217;s diverse product line in the Pacific Rim under the Sensient name. Through these operations, the Company offers a full range of products from its Flavors &#38; Fragrances Group and Color Group, as well as products developed by regional technical teams to appeal to local preferences.

Sales, marketing and technical functions are managed through the Asia Pacific Group&#8217;s headquarters in Australia. Manufacturing operations are located in Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand and the Philippines. The Asia Pacific Group maintains offices for local technical support, as well as sales, in China, India, Indonesia, Korea and Thailand, and is significantly expanding its research and development capabilities in Singapore.

Research and Development/Quality Assurance

The development of specialized products and services is a complex technical process calling upon the combined knowledge and talents of the Company&#8217;s research, development and quality assurance personnel. The Company believes that its competitive advantage lies in its ability to work with its customers to develop and deliver high-performance products that address the distinct needs of those customers.

The Company&#8217;s research, development and quality assurance personnel support the Company&#8217;s efforts to improve existing products and develop new products tailored to customer needs, while providing on-going technical support and know-how to the Company&#8217;s manufacturing activities. The Company employed 726 people in research and development, quality assurance, quality control and lab technician positions as of December 31, 2015.

Expenditures for research and development related to continuing operations in calendar year 2015 were $35.1 million, compared with $35.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, and $34.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. As part of its commitment to quality as a competitive advantage, the Company&#8217;s production facilities hold various certifications, such as those under the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and those recognized by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI), including the Safe Quality Food Program (SQF), British Retail Consortium (BRC), Food Safety System Certification (FSSC 22000) and International Featured Standards (IFS), for certifying the safety and quality of its products and production processes.

&#160;

Products and Application Activities

The Company&#8217;s strategic focus is on the manufacture and marketing of high-performance components that bring life to products. Accordingly, the Company devotes considerable attention and resources to the development of product applications and processing improvements to support its customers&#8217; numerous new and reformulated products. The majority of the proprietary processes and formulae developed by the Company are maintained as trade secrets and under confidentiality agreements with customers.

Within the Flavors &#38; Fragrances Group, development activity is focused on ingredients, flavors, fragrances, and flavor and fragrance systems that are responsive to consumer trends and the processing needs of our food and beverage customers. These activities include the development of functional ingredient systems for foods and beverages, savory flavors, and ingredient systems for prepared foods and flavors and ingredients for dairy, confectionery and other applications. The Company believes that the development of yeast derivatives and other specialty ingredients also provides growth opportunities in bionutrients and biotechnology markets, such as pharmaceuticals, vitamins, vaccines and bioremediation.

Within the Color Group, development activity for food and beverage product lines is focused on value-added products derived from synthetic dyes and pigments and natural food and beverage colors and on color systems. The Company also produces a diverse line of colors and ingredients for cosmetics and pharmaceutical applications and technical colors for industrial applications.

Raw Materials

The Company uses a wide range of raw materials in producing its products. Chemicals used to produce certified colors are obtained from several domestic and foreign suppliers. Raw materials for natural colors, such as carmine, beta-carotene, annatto and turmeric, are purchased from overseas and U.S. sources. In the production of flavors and fragrances, the principal raw materials include essential oils, aroma chemicals, botanicals, fruits and juices, and are obtained from domestic and foreign suppliers. Flavor enhancers and secondary flavors are produced from brewers&#8217; yeast and vegetable materials such as corn and soybeans. Chili peppers, onion, garlic and other vegetables are acquired under annual contracts with numerous growers in the western United States and Europe. The Company has expanded its sources of vegetables to include growers in China.

The Company believes that its ability to reformulate its products and the general availability of alternate sources of materials would enable it to maintain its competitive position in the event of an interruption in the supply of raw materials from a single supplier.

&#160;

Competition

All Company products are sold in highly competitive markets. While no single factor is determinative, the Company&#8217;s competitive position is based principally on process and applications expertise, quality, technological advances resulting from its research and development, and customer service and support. Because of its highly differentiated products, the Company competes with only a few companies across multiple product lines, and is more likely to encounter competition specific to an individual product.

&#183; Flavors &#38; Fragrances. Competition to supply the flavors and fragrances industries has taken on an increasingly global nature. Most of the Company&#8217;s customers do not buy their entire flavor and/or fragrance products from a single supplier and the Company does not compete with a single supplier in all product categories. Competition for the supply of flavors and fragrances is based on the development of customized ingredients for new and reformulated customer products, as well as on quality, customer service and price. &#160; Competition to supply dehydrated vegetable products is present through several large and small domestic competitors, as well as competitors in other countries. Competition for the supply of dehydrated vegetables is based principally on product quality, customer service and price. 

&#183; Color. &#160; Competition in the color market is diverse, with the majority of the Company&#8217;s competitors specializing in either synthetic dyes and pigments or natural colors. The Company believes that it gains a competitive advantage as the only major basic manufacturer of a full range of color products, including synthetic dyes and pigments as well as natural colors. Competition in the supply of cosmetic colors and ingredients, specialty inks and pharmaceutical excipients is based on the development of customized products and solutions as well as quality, customer service, and price. The Company believes that its reputation and capacity as a color producer as well as its product development give it a competitive advantage in these markets. 

&#183; Asia Pacific. Because of the broad array of products available to customers of the Asia Pacific Group, the Company believes that it is able to offer a wider product base than many of its competitors. Competition is based upon reliability in product quality, service and price as well as technical support available to customers. 

Foreign Operations

Additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s foreign operations is set forth below on pages 47 through 49 under the heading &#8220;Segment and Geographic Information.&#8221;

Patents, Formulae and Trademarks

The Company owns or controls many patents, formulae and trademarks related to its businesses. The businesses are not materially dependent upon any particular patent or trademark; however, trademarks, patents and formulae are important to the business of the Company.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, the Company employed 4,032 persons worldwide.

Regulation

Compliance with government provisions regulating discharges into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, did not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s operations for the year covered by this report. Current compliance is not expected to have a material adverse effect in the next two years. The production, packaging, labeling and distribution of certain of the products of the Company in the U.S. are subject to the regulations of various federal, state and local governmental agencies, in particular the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The Company is subject to similar regulations in many international markets.
