 Item 1. BUSINESS 

General 

UDR is a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets throughout the United States. The high barrier-to-entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential. At December 31, 2015 , our consolidated real estate portfolio included 133 &#32;communities located in 18 &#32;markets, with a total of 40,728 &#32;completed apartment homes, which are held through our subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership, and consolidated joint ventures. In addition, we have an ownership interest in 28 &#32;communities containing 6,696 &#32;apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company was developing one wholly-owned community with 516 apartment homes and four unconsolidated joint venture communities with 1,173 apartment homes, none of which have been completed. 

At December 31, 2015 , the Operating Partnership&#8217;s consolidated real estate portfolio included 57 &#32;communities located in 14 &#32;markets, with a total of 16,974 &#32;completed apartment homes. The Operating Partnership owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the United States. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , revenues of the Operating Partnership represented approximately 51% &#32;of our total rental revenues. 

UDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this Report as the &#8220;Code.&#8221; To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually. In 2015 , we declared total distributions of $1.11 &#32;per common share and paid dividends of $1.0925 &#32;per common share.

UDR was formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland. The Operating Partnership is the successor-in-interest to United Dominion Realty, L.P., a limited partnership formed under the laws of Virginia, which commenced operations in 1995. The Operating Partnership was redomiciled in 2004 as a Delaware limited partnership. Our corporate offices are located at 1745 Shea Center Drive, Suite 200, Highlands Ranch, Colorado and our telephone number is (720) 283-6120. Our website is www.udr.com . The information contained on our website, including any information referred to in this Report as being available on our website, is not a part of or incorporated into this Report. 

As of February 22, 2016 , we had 1,569 full-time associates and 42 part-time associates, all of whom were employed by UDR. 

Reporting Segments 

We report in two segments: Same-Store Communities &#32;and Non-Mature Communities/Other . 

Our S ame-Store Communities &#32;segment includes those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to January 1, 2014 , and held as of December 31, 2015 . These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not classified as held for sale at year end. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months. 

Our Non-Mature Communities/Other segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in Same-Store Communities, including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties. For additional information regarding our operating segments, see Note 15, Reportable Segments , in the Notes to the UDR Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report and Note 13, Reportable Segments , in the Notes to the Operating Partnership&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. 

Business Objectives 

Our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value. To achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies: 

&#8226; 

own and operate apartments in high barrier-to-entry markets, which are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential, thus enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our stockholders; 

&#8226; 

manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating, redeveloping, and developing apartment communities; 

&#8226; 

empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively; 

&#8226; 

measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets; and 

&#8226; 

manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of earnings and dividends. 

2015 &#32;Highlights 

&#8226; 

In July 2015, the Company marked its 43rd year as a REIT and paid its 172nd consecutive quarterly dividend in October. The Company&#8217;s annualized declared 2015 dividend of $1.11 represented a 6.7% increase over the previous year. 

&#8226; 

We achieved Same-Store revenue growth of 5.6% and same-store net operating income (&#8220;NOI&#8221;) growth of 6.7%. 

&#8226; 

We completed one development in Boston, MA containing 369 homes for an aggregate cost of approximately $217.7 million. We also completed the redevelopment of 708 homes at a community in New York, NY for an aggregate cost of approximately $98.0 million. 

&#8226; 

As of December 31, 2015, we were developing one wholly-owned community and four communities in unconsolidated joint ventures and redeveloping three wholly-owned communities. 

&#8226; 

In October 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of six Washington, D.C. area properties from Home Properties, L.P. (&#8220;Home OP&#8221;) for a total contractual purchase price of $900.6 million , which was comprised of $564.8 million &#32;of DownREIT Units in the newly formed DownREIT Partnership, the assumption of $89.3 million &#32;of debt, $221.0 million &#32;of reverse tax-deferred like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (&#8220;Section 1031 exchanges&#8221;), and $25.5 million &#32;of cash. The Company holds a 50.1% (including a 41.6% interest held indirectly through the Operating Partnership) controlling ownership interest in, and consolidates, the DownREIT Partnership. For additional information regarding the DownREIT Partnership, see Note 11, Noncontrolling Interests , in the notes to the UDR Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. 

&#8226; 

We contributed $136.3 million for a preferred equity investment in five west coast communities that are currently under construction. 

&#8226; 

We recognized gains on the sale of real estate of $251.7 million &#32;from the sale of 12 &#32;communities with a total of 2,735 &#32;apartment homes. A portion of the sale proceeds was designated for tax-deferred Section 1031 exchanges for a 2014 acquisition and the October 2015 acquisitions described above. 

&#8226; 

The eight communities held by the Texas joint venture were sold, generating net proceeds to UDR of $44.2 million. The Company recorded promote and disposition fee income of $10.0 million and a gain of $59.4 million (including $24.2 million of previously deferred gains). 

&#8226; 

We sold 6,339,636 &#32;shares of common stock through public offerings for net proceeds of approximately $210.0 million . 

&#8226; 

We entered into a new $1.1 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity date in January 2020, exclusive of options to extend, which replaced the prior $900 million revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature in December 2017, 

and entered into a $350.0 million &#32;senior unsecured term loan facility due January 2021, which replaced the Company&#8217;s $250 million term loan and $100 million term loan that were scheduled to mature in June 2018. 

&#8226; 

We issued $300 million of 4.00%, 10-year senior unsecured medium-term notes in September.

Our Strategies and Vision 

Our vision is to be the innovative multifamily public REIT of choice. Our strategic priorities are: 

1. Strengthen the Quality of Our Portfolio 

2. Flexible/Strong Balance Sheet 

3. Increase Cash Flow to Support Dividend Growth 

4. A Great Place to Work and Live 

Capital Allocation 

Acquisitions and Dispositions 

When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider: 

&#8226; 

population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located; 

&#8226; 

geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment, transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale; 

&#8226; 

construction quality, condition and design of the property; 

&#8226; 

current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow; 

&#8226; 

potential for capital appreciation of the property; 

&#8226; 

ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through operations and redevelopment; 

&#8226; 

whether it is located in a high barrier-to-entry market; 

&#8226; 

terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases; 

&#8226; 

occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity; 

&#8226; 

prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing of the property; and 

&#8226; 

competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area. 

We regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio. Factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include: 

&#8226; 

current market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset; 

&#8226; 

potential increases in new construction in the market area; 

&#8226; 

areas with low job growth prospects; 

&#8226; 

markets where we do not intend to establish a long-term concentration; and 

&#8226; 

operating efficiencies.

Development Activities 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Our objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio. Demographic trends, economic drivers, and how multifamily fundamentals/valuations have trended over the long-term govern our review process on where to allocate development capital. At December 31, 2015 , our development pipeline included one wholly-owned community located in Huntington Beach, California with 516 &#32;homes and a budget of $342.0 million , in which we have a carrying value of $124.1 million . 

Redevelopment Activities 

Our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement. During 2015 , we continued to redevelop properties in primary markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value. At December 31, 2015 , the Company was redeveloping all 264 &#32;apartment homes, 11 &#32;of which have been completed, at two wholly-owned communities located in San Francisco, California and Bellevue, Washington. The Company also was redeveloping one wholly-owned community in San Francisco, California with renovations to the building exterior, corridors, and common area amenities, with no impact to individual homes. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we incurred $32.9 million &#32;in major renovations, which include major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings. 

Joint Venture and Partnership Activities 

We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures. Our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community; (ii) our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (iii) our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv) our projections, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement. 

Balance Sheet Management 

We maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace. We have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate. 

Financing Activities 

As part of our plan to finance our activities, we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, fund development and redevelopment activities, and acquire apartment communities. 

Operational Excellence, Cash Flow and Dividend Growth 

Investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents. Our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio using our web-based resident internet portal. 

As a result of transforming our operations through technology, residents&#8217; satisfaction improved, and our operating teams have become more efficient. Web-based technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs, improved cash management, and better pricing management of our available apartment homes. 

Portfolio Improvement 

We are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation, high propensity to rent, low single-family home affordability, and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing. Portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and third-party research. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 69.5% of our consolidated same-store NOI was generated by communities located in our primary markets of: Seattle, Washington; San Francisco Bay Area, California; Los Angeles, California; Orange County, California; Austin, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Boston, Massachusetts; New York, New York; and Metropolitan D.C. At December 31, 2015 , the Company held 75.4% of its same-store carrying value of its real estate portfolio in our primary markets. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 73.1% of the Operating Partnership&#8217;s same-store NOI was generated by communities located in our primary markets and 73.7% of its same-store carrying value of its real estate portfolio was generated in its primary markets. 

Operating Partnership Strategies and Vision 

The Operating Partnership&#8217;s long-term strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer, more concentrated markets and enhance resident and associate service through technology. As a result, the Operating Partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities located in New York, New York; San Francisco Bay Area, California; Boston, Massachusetts; and Metropolitan D.C. over the past years. Prospectively, we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns. Markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth, low single-family home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housing, which are three key drivers to strong rental growth. 

Competitive Conditions 

Competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets. Some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have. Competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. The competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors, including sub-market supply and demand. In addition, other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties, redevelop existing properties, and to develop new properties. These competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment REITs, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do. 

We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments. We believe our competitive advantages include: 

&#8226; 

a fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise; 

&#8226; 

scalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our Internet marketing efforts; 

&#8226; 

access to sources of capital; 

&#8226; 

geographic diversification with a presence in 18 &#32;markets across the country; and 

&#8226; 

significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert. 

Moving forward, we will continue to optimize lease management, improve expense control, increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance. We believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio&#8217;s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational upside. 

Communities 

At December 31, 2015 , our consolidated real estate portfolio included 133 &#32;communities with a total of 40,728 &#32;completed apartment homes, which included the Operating Partnership&#8217;s consolidated real estate portfolio of 57 &#32;communities with a total of 16,974 &#32;completed apartment homes. The overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents. 

At December 31, 2015 , the Company was developing one wholly-owned community with 516 apartment homes, none of which have been completed. The community being developed is not part of the Operating Partnership&#8217;s real estate portfolio. 

At December 31, 2015 , the Company was redeveloping 264 apartment homes, 11 of which have been completed, at two wholly-owned communities. The Company was also was redeveloping one wholly-owned community, with renovations to the building exterior, corridors, and common area amenities, with no impact to individual homes. Two of these communities under redevelopment are held by the Operating Partnership. 

Same-Store Community Comparison 

We believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same-store communities&#8217; NOI, which is total rental revenue, less rental and other operating expenses excluding property management. Our same-store community population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , our same-store NOI increase d by $29.5 million &#32;compared to the prior year. Our same-store community properties provided 76.4% of our total NOI for the year ended December 31, 2015 . The increase in NOI for the 33,063 same-store apartment homes, or 81.2% of our portfolio, was driven by an increase in rental rates and fee and reimbursement income, partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes, utilities expense, and personnel costs. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Operating Partnership&#8217;s same-store NOI increased by $8.2 million &#32;compared to the prior year. Our same-store community properties provided 81.9% &#32;of our total NOI for the year ended December 31, 2015 . The increase in NOI for the 14,760 &#32;same-store apartment homes, or 87.0% of the Operating Partnership&#8217;s portfolio, was driven by an increase in rental rates, fee and reimbursement income, increased occupancy, and an decrease in operating expenses. 

Revenue growth in 2016 &#32;may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the general economy, reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, new supply, increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents. 

Tax Matters 

UDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To continue to qualify as a REIT, UDR must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. Provided we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. 

We may utilize our taxable REIT subsidiary (&#8220;TRS&#8221;) to engage in activities that REITs may be prohibited from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. Our TRS generally is taxable as a regular corporation, and therefore, subject to federal, state and local income taxes. 

The Operating Partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability. However, any state or 

local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the Operating Partnership are incurred at the entity level. 

Inflation 

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, property taxes, utilities and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a term of 14 months or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. Although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Environmental Matters 

Various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. Such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party. 

To date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have a property management plan for hazardous materials. As part of the plan, Phase I environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. In addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. The inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property. Nevertheless, it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. We do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. We believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards. 

Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. In addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities. 

We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. We do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. Future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. Also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition. 

Insurance 

We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. We are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the multi family apartment industry, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.
