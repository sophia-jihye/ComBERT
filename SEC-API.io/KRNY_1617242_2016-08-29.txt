General

Kearny Financial Corp. (the "Company," or "Kearny Financial"), is a Maryland corporation that is the holding company for Kearny Bank (the "Bank"), a federally&#8209;chartered stock savings bank.

On May 18, 2015, the Company completed its second-step conversion and stock offering through which it converted from the mutual holding company structure to a fully publicly held company. In conjunction with that transaction, the Company sold 71,750,000 shares of its common stock at $10.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $717.5 million. The new shares issued included 3,612,500 shares sold to the Bank’s Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") with an aggregate value of $36.1 million based on the sales price of $10.00 per share. Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, the Company also issued an additional 500,000 shares of its common stock with an aggregate value of $5.0 million and contributed these shares with an additional $5.0 million in cash to the KearnyBank Foundation.

The Company recognized direct stock offering costs of $10.7 million in conjunction with the transaction which reduced the net proceeds credited to capital. After adjusting for transaction costs and the value of the shares issued to the Bank’s ESOP, the Company recognized a net increase in equity capital of $670.7 million, of which $353.4 million was contributed to the Bank by the Company as an additional investment in the Bank’s common equity. Approximately $34.5 million of new capital proceeds were funded through withdrawals of existing customer deposits previously held by the Bank.

Each outstanding share held by the public stockholders of Kearny Financial Corp., a federal corporation, immediately prior to the closing of the conversion and stock offering was converted into 1.3804 shares of the Company’s new common stock while the shares previously held by Kearny MHC, the former mutual holding company, were cancelled concurrent with the closing of the transaction. As a result of the completion of the second-step conversion and stock offering, all historical share and per share information has been revised to reflect the 1.3804-to-one exchange ratio. At June 30, 2016, the Company had 91,821,910 shares outstanding.

The Company is a unitary savings and loan holding company, regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB") and conducts no significant business or operations of its own. The Bank’s deposits are federally insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund as administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") and the Bank is primarily regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"). References in this Annual Report on Form 10&#8209;K to the Company or Kearny Financial generally refer to the Company and the Bank, unless the context indicates otherwise. References to "we", "us", or "our" refer to the Bank or Company, or both, as the context indicates. 

The Company’s primary business is the ownership and operation of the Bank. The Bank is principally engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public in New Jersey and New York and using these deposits, together with other funds, to originate or purchase loans for its portfolio and invest in securities. Our loan portfolio is primarily comprised of loans collateralized by commercial and residential real estate augmented by secured and unsecured loans to businesses and consumers. We also maintain a portfolio of investment securities, primarily comprised of U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. government and agency debentures, bank-qualified municipal obligations, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations. The Bank maintains a small balance of single issuer trust preferred securities and non-agency mortgage-backed securities which were acquired through the Company’s purchase of other institutions and does not actively purchase such securities.

At June 30, 2016, net loans receivable comprised 59.0% of our total assets while investment securities, including mortgage&#8209;backed and non-mortgage-backed securities, comprised 27.8 % of our total assets. By comparison, at June 30, 2015, net loans receivable comprised 49.3 % of our total assets while securities comprised 33.8% of our total assets. A significant long term goal of our business plan is to reallocate our balance sheet to reflect a greater percentage of interest-earning assets to loans while, in turn, reducing the relative size of the securities portfolio. The composition and volume of loan originations and purchases during fiscal 2016 reflected that strategic focus as we increased our commercial loan origination and support staff and expanded relationships with loan participants and other external loan origination resources.

We operate from our administrative headquarters in Fairfield, New Jersey and had 42 branch offices as of June 30, 2016. Our internet address is www.kearnybank.com . Information on our website is not and should not be considered to be part of this report.

Business Strategy 

Our goal is to continue to evolve from a traditional thrift business model toward that of a full service, community bank, profitably deploying capital and enhancing earnings through a variety of balance sheet growth and diversification strategies. The key strategic initiatives of our business plan are presented below accompanied by an overview of our activities and achievements in support of those initiatives:

- 

Continue to Increase Commercial Mortgage Lending 

During fiscal 2016, we increased our commercial mortgage loan portfolio by 42.2%, or $551.9 million, to $1.86 billion at June 30, 2016 from $1.31 billion at June 30, 2015. This increase reflected commercial mortgage loan originations and purchases in fiscal 2016 totaling $489.3 million and $274.9 million, respectively. At June 30, 2016, our commercial mortgage loan portfolio comprised 69.7% of total loans compared to 62.3% of total loans at June 30, 2015.

We plan to continue to increase our portfolio of commercial mortgage loans by expanding loan acquisition volume through all available channels, including retail and broker originations, as well as individual and pooled loan purchases and participations. Additionally, we intend to continue to expand our commercial lending infrastructure and resources, which will be supported by new product and pricing strategies designed to increase origination volume in a very competitive marketplace.

- 

Increase Commercial Business Lending 

We plan to continue to focus our efforts on expanding our commercial non-real estate secured and unsecured business lending activities through all available channels. During fiscal 2016, our commercial business loans origination and purchase volume totaled $40.6 million reflecting retail originations of $20.8 million augmented by the acquisition of commercial and industrial ("C&amp;I") loans through wholesale channels totaling $19.8 million.

We restructured and realigned our lending infrastructure during the latter half of fiscal 2016, which contributed to a temporary decline in commercial business loan origination and purchase volume for the year. As a result of those enhancements, we anticipate this loan segment will increase in fiscal 2017 and thereafter. Moreover, we will attempt to expand our relationships with these borrowers to include commercial deposits and other products, with the goal of increasing our non-interest income. 

The noted changes to our commercial business lending resources and infrastructure also served to better support our Small Business Administration ("SBA") resources. SBA loan sale volume increased by $2.6 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.

We anticipate a continued increase in the level of non-interest income through greater gains on sale of SBA loans as well as other business loan-related fee income. Moreover, our business lending strategies will continue to be undertaken within a larger set of strategic initiatives designed to promote other business banking services intended to increase commercial deposit balances and services.

- 

Continue to Modestly Increase Residential Mortgage Portfolio Lending 

We plan to modestly increase our portfolio of one- to four-family mortgage loans including first mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit while maintaining our conservative underwriting standards relating to such loans. During fiscal 2016, our portfolio of such loans increased by $10.8 million to $694.8 million or 26.0% of total loans from $684.0 million or 32.5% of total loans at June 30, 2015. We originated and purchased $87.2 million and $36.3 million, respectively, of one- to four-family first mortgage loans during the year ended June 30, 2016 compared to $51.3 million and $55.9 million, respectively, during the year ended June 30, 2015. 

The overall stability in the outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loan portfolio and, more significantly, its decline as a percentage of total loans, continues to reflect our decreased strategic focus on residential mortgage portfolio lending. We anticipate that this segment of our loan portfolio will continue to decline as a percentage of total loans and earning assets as other loan categories grow.

- 

Increase Residential Mortgage Banking 

We are continuing to expand our residential mortgage lending infrastructure to increase the origination volume of residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. During fiscal 2016, we hired a new Director of Residential Lending who updated the Company’s residential lending infrastructure during the latter half of the year to support that objective. Our mortgage banking business strategy was initially implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and we recognized a total of $82,000 in gains on the sale of $6.0 million of mortgage loans held for sale during that quarter. We anticipate an increase in residential mortgage loan origination and sale activity that is expected to support growth in the our non-interest income over time through the recognition of recurring loan sale gains, while also serving to help manage the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk.

- 

Continue to Reduce the Securities Portfolio while Maintaining Sector Diversity 

In recent years, we have diversified the composition and allocation of our investment portfolio into new asset sectors, including asset-backed securities, corporate bonds, municipal obligations, collateralized loan obligations and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") while reducing our concentration in traditional residential MBS. Several of the added sectors include floating rate securities that reduce the level of interest rate risk ("IRR") embedded in our securities portfolio. 

Our securities portfolio decreased by $175.2 million, or 12.2%, to $1.26 billion, or 30.3% of earning assets, at June 30, 2016 from $1.43 billion, or 36.8% of earning assets, at June 30, 2015 reflecting the reinvestment of security cash flows into the loan portfolio. We expect to continue utilizing a significant portion of cash flows from the securities portfolio to fund a portion of our expected loan growth while maintaining the diversity of sectors represented in the portfolio as its overall balance continues to decline as a percentage of earning assets over time.

- 

Maintain Strong Asset Quality 

We continue to emphasize and maintain strong asset quality as we grow and diversify our loan portfolio. Nonperforming assets decreased by $1.9 million to $21.9 million, or 0.49% of total assets, at June 30, 2016 compared to $23.8 million, or 0.56% of total assets, at June 30, 2015 and $26.9 million, or 0.77% of total assets, at June 30, 2014.

- 

Expand Funding Through Retail Deposits 

Our total deposit balances increased by $229.2 million during fiscal 2016 with aggregate deposits totaling $2.69 billion at June 30, 2016 compared to $2.47 billion at June 30, 2015. The increase in overall deposits during fiscal 2016 partly reflected a $205.8 million increase in certificates of deposit coupled with a net increase of $23.4 million in non-maturity deposits. The net increase in non-maturity deposits largely reflected a $20.2 million, or 9.3%, increase in non-interest-bearing deposit accounts for fiscal 2016.

At June 30, 2016, we have a total of 42 branches comprising 40 branches located in northern and central New Jersey with two additional branches located in Brooklyn and Staten Island, New York. We plan to selectively evaluate branch network expansion opportunities, with a particular focus on limited branch expansion in Brooklyn and Staten Island. We will also continue to evaluate additional de novo branch opportunities to contiguously expand our existing New Jersey branch network with an emphasis on "fill-ins" between our northern and central New Jersey locations. 

Notwithstanding the opportunities presented by de novo branching, we expect to place greater strategic emphasis on leveraging the opportunities to increase market share and expand the depth and breadth of customer relationships within our existing branch system. We continue to develop and deploy strategies to promote the "relationship banking" business model throughout our branch network with an emphasis on expanding business customer relationships linked to business lending initiatives.

- 

Seek Out Merger and Acquisition Opportunities 

As a complement to the "organic" growth strategies, we continue to actively seek out opportunities to deploy capital, diversify our balance sheet mix, enter new markets and enhance earnings through mergers and acquisitions with other financial institutions. We are an experienced acquiror, having acquired five banks in the last 16 years. We expect to place the greatest emphasis on opportunities to expand within the existing markets we serve or to enter new markets that are generally contiguous to such markets.

In addition to potential acquisitions of financial institutions or their branches, we may explore additional opportunities for acquisitions or strategic partnerships to broaden our product and service offerings in the future.

- 

Improve Operating Efficiency 

In conjunction with our efforts to improve operating efficiency and control operating expenses, while expanding and enhancing product and service offerings, we continued to deploy a number of technologies during fiscal 2016 that support our internal IT infrastructure as well as our external customer-facing systems. Many of these technology enhancements were made available through our prior conversion to the Fiserv, Inc. platform during fiscal 2014.

We consider the noted enhancements to our information technology infrastructure to be one of several strategies being deployed to control growth in non-interest expenses and improve our overall operating efficiency. During the first half of fiscal 2016, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of our operating practices, policies and procedures and the effectiveness with which its supporting infrastructure, including human resources and systems, were organized, deployed and utilized. A significant number of the findings and recommendations from that study were implemented during the latter half of fiscal 2016 while other initiatives are expected to be implemented during fiscal 2017.

The initiatives we implemented based on this study contributed to an improvement in our operating efficiency during fiscal 2016 while reallocating certain internal costs to better support our strategic goals and objectives. For example, our ratio of non-interest expense to average assets decreased to 1.64% for fiscal 2016 from 2.10% for fiscal 2015, or 1.83% for fiscal 2015 after adjusting for the non-recurring expense associated with the Company’s $10.0 million charitable contribution to the KearnyBank Foundation, as discussed earlier. 

Our operating efficiency ratio also improved to 68.50% for fiscal 2016 from 88.18% for fiscal, 2015, or 76.89% for fiscal 2015 as adjusted for the noted charitable contribution. We also decreased our number of full time equivalent ("FTE") employees by 20 FTEs, or 4.4%, to 438 FTEs at June 30, 2016 from 458 FTEs at June 30, 2015 with the reduction in FTE count arising largely through attrition.

Market Area. At June 30, 2016, our primary market area consists of the counties in which we currently operate branches including Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic and Union counties in New Jersey and Kings (Brooklyn) and Richmond (Staten Island) counties in New York. Our lending is concentrated in these markets and our predominant sources of deposits are the communities in which our offices are located as well as the neighboring communities. 

Our primary market area is largely urban and suburban with a broad economic base as is typical within the New York metropolitan area. Service jobs represent the largest employment sector followed by wholesale/retail trade. A downturn in the local economy could reduce the amount of funds available for deposit and the ability of borrowers to repay their loans which would adversely affect our profitability.

Competition. We operate in a market area with a high concentration of banking and financial institutions and we face substantial competition in attracting deposits and in originating loans. A number of our competitors are significantly larger institutions with greater financial and managerial resources and lending limits. Our ability to compete successfully is a significant factor affecting our growth potential and profitability. 

Our competition for deposits and loans historically has come from other insured financial institutions such as local and regional commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions located in our primary market area. We also compete with mortgage banking and finance companies for real estate loans and with commercial banks and savings institutions for consumer loans. We also face competition for attracting funds from providers of alternative investment products such as equity and fixed income investments such as corporate, agency and government securities as well as the mutual funds that invest in these instruments.

There are large retail banking competitors operating throughout our primary market area, including Bank of America, Citibank, JP Morgan Chase Bank, PNC Bank, TD Bank, and Wells Fargo Bank and we also face strong competition from other community-based financial institutions.

Lending Activities

General. In conjunction with our strategic efforts to evolve from a traditional thrift to a full-service community bank, our lending strategies have placed increasing emphasis on the origination of commercial loans while diminishing the emphasis on one- to four-family mortgage portfolio lending. The year-to-year trends in the composition and allocation of our loan portfolio, as reported in the table below, highlight those changes in business strategy. In particular, the outstanding balance of our commercial mortgages, including loans secured by multi&#8209;family, mixed&#8209;use and nonresidential properties, have significantly increased from both a dollar amount and percentage of portfolio basis over the past several years. By comparison, residential mortgage loans have consistently declined as a percentage of the loan portfolio over the past several years. 

Our commercial loan offerings also include secured business loans, many of which are secured by real estate, and unsecured business loans. Commercial loan offerings include programs offered through the SBA in which Kearny Bank participates as a Preferred Lender. Our consumer loan offerings primarily include home equity loans and home equity lines of credit as well as account loans, overdraft lines of credit, vehicle loans and personal loans. We also offer construction loans to builders/developers as well as individual homeowners. Substantially all of our borrowers are residents of our primary market area and would be expected to be similarly affected by economic and other conditions in that area. We have purchased out-of-state one- to four-family first mortgage loans to supplement our in-house originations. For more information, please see "Lending Activities (Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Solicitation and Processing)."

One- to Four-Family Mortgage Loans Held in Portfolio. Our portfolio lending activities include the origination of one- to four-family first mortgage loans, of which approximately $562.8 million or 93.0% are secured by properties located within New Jersey and New York as of June 30, 2016 with the remaining $42.4 million or 7.0% secured by properties in other states. Our largest outstanding balance at that date was $1.8 million, which was secured by a residential property located in Edgartown, Massachusetts and was performing in accordance with its terms. 

During the year ended June 30, 2016, Kearny Bank originated $87.2 million of one- to four-family first mortgage portfolio loans compared to $51.3 million in the year ended June 30, 2015. To supplement portfolio loan originations, we also purchased one- to four-family first mortgages totaling $36.3 million during the year ended June 30, 2016, compared to $55.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2015.

The balance of one- to four-family mortgage portfolio loans at June 30, 2016 included a small portfolio of Non-Income Verification ("NIV") loans that were originated by Atlas Bank prior to 2011. Atlas’ NIV loan program did not require the borrower to provide full financial documentation upon application. As such, Atlas Bank relied solely on the loan-to-value ratio of the property and the borrower’s credit when approving an application under this program. The NIV program was terminated by Atlas Bank in 2011. The NIV loans acquired from Atlas Bank had outstanding balances of approximately $14.0 million at June 30, 2016. All NIV loans originally acquired from Atlas Bank were performing loans at June 30, 2016 with no such loans reported as "non-accrual" or "over 90 days past due and accruing" as of that date.

In total, origination and purchase volume of one- to four-family mortgage portfolio loans outpaced loan repayments during fiscal 2016 resulting in a net increase in the outstanding balance of this segment of the loan portfolio. Our business plan calls for generally maintaining a reduced strategic emphasis on one- to four-family mortgage portfolio lending by modestly increasing the outstanding balance of this segment but reducing its basis as a percentage of total loans.

We will originate a one- to four-family mortgage loan on an owner-occupied property with a principal amount of up to 95% of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property, with private mortgage insurance required if the loan-to-value ratio exceeds 80%. At June 30, 2016, our one- to four-family mortgage loan portfolio was primarily comprised of loans secured by owner-occupied properties. Our loan-to-value limit on a non-owner-occupied property is 75%. Loans in excess of $1.0 million are handled on a case-by-case basis and are subject to lower loan-to-value limits, generally no more than 50%.

We offer a first-time homebuyer program for persons who have not previously owned real estate and are purchasing a one- to four-family property in our primary lending area for use as a primary residence. This program is also available outside these areas, but only to persons who are existing deposit or loan customers of Kearny Bank and/or members of their immediate families. The financial incentives offered under this program are a one-eighth of one percentage point rate reduction on all first mortgage loan types and the refund of the application fee at closing.

The fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate for portfolio generally meet the secondary mortgage market standards of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac").

Substantially all of our residential mortgages include "due on sale" clauses, which give us the right to declare a loan immediately payable if the borrower sells or otherwise transfers an interest in the property to a third party. Property appraisals on real estate securing our one- to four-family first mortgage loans are made by state certified or licensed independent appraisers approved by Kearny Bank’s Board of Directors. Appraisals are performed in accordance with applicable regulations and policies. We require title insurance policies on all first mortgage real estate loans originated. Homeowners, liability and fire insurance and, if applicable, flood insurance, are also required. 

One- to Four-Family Mortgage Loans Held for Sale. During fiscal 2016, we expanded our residential mortgage lending activities to include mortgage banking strategies through which we originate one- to four-family mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. As above, the loans we originate for sale generally meet the same secondary mortgage market standards as those applicable to loans originated for portfolio. Moreover, such loans are generally originated by, and sourced from, the same resources and markets as those loans originated and held in portfolio, as discussed above. 

As noted earlier, our mortgage banking business strategy was initially implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 through which we recognized a total of $82,000 in gains associated with the sale of $6.0 million of mortgage loans held for sale during the quarter and year ended June 30, 2016. As of that date, an additional $3.3 million of loans were held and committed for sale into the secondary market. We anticipate an increase in residential mortgage loan origination and sale activity which is expected to support growth in the our non-interest income over time through the recognition of recurring loan sale gains, while also serving to help manage the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk.

Multi-Family and Nonresidential Real Estate Mortgage Loans. We also originate commercial mortgage loans on multi-family and nonresidential properties, including loans on apartment buildings, retail/service properties and land as well as other income-producing properties, such as mixed-use properties combining residential and commercial space. Our growing strategic emphasis in commercial lending resulted in the origination of approximately $489.3 million of multi-family and nonresidential real estate mortgages during the year ended June 30, 2016, compared to $290.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2015. Our largest outstanding commercial mortgage loan balance at June 30, 2016 was $20.0 million, which is secured by an office building and performing in accordance with its terms. 

Our commercial mortgage acquisition strategies also included purchases of whole loans and participations totaling $274.9 million and $136.1 million during the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in loan purchases during fiscal 2016 largely reflected the deployment of a portion of the proceeds received in conjunction with the closing of the Company’s second-step conversion and stock offering at the end of fiscal 2015.

In total, commercial mortgage loan acquisition volume significantly outpaced loan repayments during fiscal 2016 resulting in the reported net increase in the outstanding balance of this segment of the loan portfolio. Our business plan continues to call for maintaining our strategic emphasis on commercial mortgage lending by increasing this segment of the portfolio on both a dollar and percentage of assets basis.

We generally require no less than a 25% down payment or equity position for mortgage loans on multi-family and nonresidential properties. For such loans, we generally require personal guarantees. However, the Bank may consider multi-family and nonresidential real estate mortgages for approval on a non-personally guaranteed (non-recourse) basis when the overall strengths of a proposed loan asset sufficiently mitigates the risk of exculpating the principal owners from their personal guarantee. In such cases, the Bank generally requires borrowers to execute an indemnification agreement which personally obligates those individuals in the circumstances of fraud, negligence, environmental issues, improper conveyance, condemnation, bankruptcy or other additional provisions deemed appropriate by the Bank.

We generally offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate balloon mortgage loans on multi-family and non-residential properties with final stated maturities ranging from five to twelve years and initial interest rate reset terms ranging from five to seven years, where applicable. Our balloon mortgage loans within this category generally have payments based on amortization terms from 25 to 30 years. We also offer fully amortizing fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans on multi-family and non-residential properties with terms up to 25 years. Our commercial mortgage loans are primarily secured by properties located in New Jersey and New York and, to a lesser extent, properties located in eastern Pennsylvania.

Commercial mortgage loans are generally considered to entail a greater level of risk than that which arises from one- to four-family, owner-occupied real estate lending. The repayment of these loans typically is dependent on a successful operation and income stream of the borrower and the real estate securing the loan as collateral. These risks can be significantly affected by economic conditions. In addition, commercial mortgage loans to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers generally carry larger balances than one- to four-family mortgage loans. Consequently, such loans typically require substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts compared to residential real estate lending.

Commercial Business Loans. We also originate commercial term loans and lines of credit to a variety of professionals, sole proprietorships and small businesses in our market area including loans originated through the SBA in which Kearny Bank participates as a Preferred Lender. Kearny Bank originated approximately $20.8 million of commercial business loans during the year ended June 30, 2016 compared to $20.0 million during the year ended June 30, 2015. Of the loans we originated, our largest outstanding commercial business loan balance at June 30, 2016 was $2.9 million, which was secured by land. This loan was performing in accordance with its original terms at June 30, 2016. 

Our commercial business loan acquisition strategies included purchases of wholesale C&amp;I loan participations totaling $19.8 million and $41.0 million during the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our C&amp;I loan participations at June 30, 2016 included 22 loans with an outstanding balance of $44.3 million. These participations included our pro rata interest in 21 loans totaling $34.6 million representing the obligations of 17 separate commercial borrowers that were acquired through Kearny Bank’s membership in BancAlliance, a cooperative network of lending institutions that serves as a conduit for institutional investors to participate in middle-market commercial credits. The BancAlliance network is supported and managed on a day-to-day basis by Alliance Partners and its wholly-owned subsidiary AP Commercial LLC which acts as investment advisor and asset manager for loans acquired through the BancAlliance network while retaining a portion of such loans as an investor. At June 30, 2015, our BancAlliance participations had an outstanding balance of $25.1 million representing our pro rata interest in 17 loans.

Our C&amp;I participations at June 30, 2016 also included one additional loan with an outstanding balance of $9.7 million that was purchased through the broadly syndicate commercial loan market. The loan represents an obligation of a single commercial borrower that was rated by one or more independent, third-party credit rating agencies.

Our largest wholesale C&amp;I loan participation at June 30, 2016 comprised one loan to a leading manufacturer of aircraft interior products for both commercial airlines and business jets with aggregate outstanding balances totaling $9.7 million and was performing in accordance with its original loan terms at June 30, 2016 . 

In total, commercial business loan repayments and sales outpaced loan acquisition volume during fiscal 2016 resulting in the reported net decrease in the outstanding balance of this segment of the loan portfolio. As noted earlier, we restructured and realigned our lending infrastructure and resources during the latter half of fiscal 2016 which contributed to a temporary decline in commercial business loan origination and purchase volume for the year. As a result of those enhancements, we anticipate this loan segment will increase as we continue to acquire loans through retail origination channels as well as purchases and participations acquired though wholesale sources with the goal of increasing this portfolio on both a dollar and percentage of assets basis.

Our commercial business loan activity during fiscal 2016 included the sale of $2.6 million of SBA loan participations which resulted in the recognition of related sale gains totaling approximately $242,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. By comparison, we sold $1.2 million of SBA loan participations during fiscal 2015 which resulted in the recognition of related sale gains totaling approximately $111,000. Our business plan calls for a continued increase in SBA lending activity from the levels reported during fiscal 2016. As noted earlier, the changes to our commercial business lending resources and infrastructure that were implemented during fiscal 2016 also served to better support our SBA lending resources that had been previously augmented and enhanced during the prior fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.

At June 30, 2016, approximately $43.9 million or 49.8% of our commercial business loans represent loans originated through our retail channel while the remaining $44.3 million or 50.2% comprise loans acquired through the wholesale C&amp;I loan participation channels discussed earlier. Of the retail originated loans, approximately $37.7 million or 85.9% are "non-SBA" loans consisting of secured and unsecured loans totaling $35.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively. We generally require personal guarantees on all "non-SBA" commercial business loans originated. Marketable securities may also be accepted as collateral on lines of credit, but with a loan to value limit of 50%. The loan to value limit on secured commercial lines of credit and term loans is otherwise generally limited to 70%. Unsecured commercial loans may take the form of overdraft checking authorization up to $25,000 and unsecured lines of credit up to $25,000. Our "non-SBA" commercial term loans generally have terms of up to 20 years and are mostly fixed-rate loans. Our commercial lines of credit have terms of up to two years and are generally adjustable-rate loans. We also offer a one-year, interest-only commercial line of credit with a balloon payment.

The remaining $6.2 million or 14.1% of commercial business loans originated represent the retained portion of SBA loan originations. Such loans are generally secured by various forms of collateral, including real estate, business equipment and other forms of collateral. Kearny Bank generally sells the guaranteed portion of eligible SBA loans originated, which ranges from 50% to 90% of the loan’s outstanding balance while retaining the nonguaranteed portion of such loans in portfolio. Kearny Bank also retains both the guaranteed and non-guaranteed portion of those SBA originations that are generally ineligible for sale in the secondary market. At June 30, 2016, approximately $1.6 million of the retained portion of Kearny Bank’s SBA loans is guaranteed by the SBA.

Unlike single-family, owner-occupied residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans, including those originated under SBA programs, are typically made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment. Commercial business loans, therefore, generally have greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans. In addition, commercial business loans may carry larger balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers than one- to four-family first mortgage loans. As such, commercial business lending requires substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts compared to residential or commercial real estate lending. 

Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. Our home equity loans are fixed-rate loans for terms of generally up to 20 years. We also offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate home equity lines of credit with terms of up to 20 years. During the year ended June 30, 2016, Kearny Bank originated $22.7 million of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit compared to $21.3 million in the year ended June 30, 2015. However, repayments of home equity loans and lines of credit outpaced loan origination volume during fiscal 2016 resulting in the reported net decline in the outstanding balance of this segment of the loan portfolio. Our largest outstanding home equity loan and line of credit balance at June 30, 2016 was $473,000, which was secured by a single family residence located in Ocean Township, New Jersey and performing in accordance with its terms. 

Collateral value is determined through a property value analysis report provided by a state certified or licensed independent appraiser. In some cases, we determine collateral value by a full appraisal performed by a state certified or licensed independent appraiser. Home equity loans and lines of credit do not require title insurance but do require homeowner, liability and fire insurance and, if applicable, flood insurance.

Home equity loans and fixed-rate home equity lines of credit are generally originated in our market area and are generally made in amounts of up to 80% of value on term loans and of up to 75% of value on home equity adjustable-rate lines of credit. We originate home equity loans secured by either a first lien or a second lien on the property.

Consumer Loans. Our consumer loan portfolio includes unsecured overdraft lines of credit and personal loans as well as loans secured by savings accounts and certificates of deposit on deposit with Kearny Bank. Our unsecured consumer loans at June 30, 2016 primarily include $21.8 million of loans acquired through the Company’s relationship with Lending Club, an established peer-to-peer (i.e. marketplace) lender. Through this relationship, the Company has purchased high-quality, unsecured consumer loans originated through Lending Club’s online platform. The remaining balance of consumer loans at June 30, 2016 includes $3.3 million of loans fully secured by savings accounts or certificates of deposit held by the Bank and $285,000 of other unsecured consumer loans. We will generally lend up to 90% of the account balance on a loan secured by a savings account or certificate of deposit. 

Our consumer loans generally entail greater risks compared to the other categories of loans that we originate or purchase and hold in portfolio. Consumer loan repayment is dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and is more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. The application of various federal laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on consumer loans in the event of a default.

Our underwriting standards for internally originated consumer loans include a determination of the applicant’s credit history and an assessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant’s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment and any additional verifiable secondary income. Our externally originated consumer loans purchased through Lending Club are limited to those issued to qualified borrowers falling within the three highest credit tiers defined within Lending Club’s proprietary credit risk model. 

Construction Lending. Our construction lending includes loans to individuals for construction of one- to four-family residences or for major renovations or improvements to an existing dwelling. Our construction lending also includes loans to builders and developers for multi-unit buildings or multi-house projects. At June 30, 2016, construction loans totaled $2.0 million. Our largest construction loan balance at that date was $1.1 million, which was secured by a residential property located in Old Tappan, New Jersey and performing in accordance with its terms. 

During the year ended June 30, 2016, construction loan disbursements were $1.1 million compared to $4.3 million during the year ended June 30, 2015. However, the repayment of construction loans more than offset these disbursements during fiscal 2016 resulting in the reported net decline in the outstanding balance of this segment of the loan portfolio. 

Construction borrowers must hold title to the land free and clear of any liens. Financing for construction loans is limited to 80% of the anticipated appraised value of the completed property. Disbursements are made in accordance with inspection reports by our approved appraisal firms. Terms of financing are generally limited to one year with an interest rate tied to the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal and may include a premium of one or more points. In some cases, we convert a construction loan to a permanent mortgage loan upon completion of construction. 

We have no formal limits as to the number of projects a builder has under construction or development and make a case-by-case determination on loans to builders and developers who have multiple projects under development. The Board of Directors reviews Kearny Bank’s business relationship with a builder or developer prior to accepting a loan application for processing. We generally do not make construction loans to builders on a speculative basis. There must be a contract for sale in place. Financing is provided for up to two houses at a time in a multi-house project, requiring a contract on one of the two houses before financing for the next house may be obtained.

We are currently evaluating lending opportunities and strategies through which we may expand our construction lending activity, funding commitments and outstanding balances in the future. If undertaken, we expect that the growth in our construction lending program will be supported by a corresponding expansion of our internal lending infrastructure and resources to support a growing number of relationships and projects with builders/borrowers.

Construction lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than mortgage lending. If the initial estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, we may be compelled to advance additional funds to complete the construction with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, there is no assurance that we will be able to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period.

Loans to One Borrower. Federal law generally limits the amount that a savings institution may lend to one borrower to the greater of $500,000 or 15% of the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2016, our loans-to-one-borrower limit was approximately $108.4 million. 

Notwithstanding regulatory limitations regarding loans to one borrower, the Bank has established a more conservative set of internal thresholds that further limit our lending exposure to any single borrower or set of borrowers affiliated by common ownership. In that regard, the Bank’s internal "house limits" are $20.0 million for a single loan transaction and $60.0 million for aggregate loans to a common ownership or an affiliated group of borrowers/guarantors. These limits apply irrespective of whether the obligations are on a personally guaranteed/recourse basis or non-personally guaranteed/non-recourse basis. Exceptions to these internal limits may be considered on a case-by-case basis, subject to the review and approval of each exception by the Bank’s Board of Directors.

At June 30, 2016, our largest single borrower had an aggregate outstanding loan balance of approximately $37.3 million comprising three multi-family mortgage loans. Our second largest single borrower had an aggregate outstanding loan balance of approximately $37.2 million comprising three multi-family mortgage loans. Our third largest borrower had an aggregate outstanding loan balance of approximately $35.2 million comprising one commercial mortgage loan and two multi-family mortgage loans. At June 30, 2016, all of these lending relationships were current and performing in accordance with the terms of their loan agreements. By comparison, at June 30, 2015, loans outstanding to Kearny Bank’s three largest borrowers totaled approximately $38.0 million, $36.0 million and $27.0 million, respectively.

Our customary sources of loan applications include loans originated by our commercial and residential loan officers, repeat customers, referrals from realtors and other professionals and "walk-in" customers. These sources are supported in varying degrees by our newspaper and electronic advertising and marketing strategies.

During prior years, we had purchased loans under the terms of loan purchase and servicing agreements with three large nationwide lenders, in order to supplement our residential mortgage loan production pipeline. The original agreements called for the purchase of loan pools that contained mortgages on residential properties in our lending area. Subsequently, we expanded our loan purchase and servicing agreements with the same nationwide lenders to include mortgage loans secured by residential real estate located outside of New Jersey. We have procedures in place for purchasing these mortgages such that the underwriting guidelines are consistent with those used in our in-house loan origination process. The evaluation and approval process ensures that the purchased loans generally conform to our normal underwriting guidelines. Our due diligence process includes full credit reviews and an examination of the title policy and associated legal instruments. We recalculate debt service and loan-to-value ratios for accuracy and review appraisals for reasonableness. All loan packages presented to Kearny Bank must meet our underwriting requirements as outlined in the purchase and servicing agreements and are subject to the same review process outlined above. Furthermore, there are stricter underwriting guidelines in place for out-of-state mortgages, including higher minimum credit scores. We did not purchase residential mortgage loans under the noted purchase and servicing agreements during the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 but may do so in the future.

Once we purchase the loans, we continually monitor the seller’s performance by thoroughly reviewing portfolio balancing reports, remittance reports, delinquency reports and other data supplied to us on a monthly basis. We also review the seller’s financial statements and documentation as to their compliance with the servicing standards established by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. 

As of June 30, 2016, our portfolio of "out-of-state" residential mortgages includes loans located in nine states outside of New Jersey and New York that total approximately $42.4 million or 7.0% of one- to four-family mortgage loans. The states with the three largest concentrations of such loans at June 30, 2016 were Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, with outstanding principal balances totaling $30.0 million, $6.3 million and $1.9 million, respectively. The aggregate outstanding balances of loans in each of the remaining six states total approximately $4.2 million and comprise approximately 9.7% of the total balance of out-of-state residential mortgage loans with aggregate balances by state ranging from $239,000 to $1.2 million.

We have also entered into purchase agreements with a number of bank and non-bank originators to supplement our loan production pipeline. These agreements call for our purchase of one- to four-family first mortgage loans on either a servicing released or servicing retained basis from the seller. As noted earlier, the aggregate carrying value of the loans purchased from these sources during the year ended June 30, 2016 totaled approximately $36.3 million comprising loans secured primarily by residential properties located in New Jersey and Massachusetts.

In addition to purchasing one- to four-family loans, we have also purchased commercial mortgage loans and participations originated by other banks and non-bank originators. As noted earlier, the aggregate carrying value of the loans and participations purchased from these sources during the year ended June 30, 2016 totaled approximately $274.9 million comprising loans secured primarily by multi-family and non-residential properties located in New Jersey, New York and eastern Pennsylvania. We also purchased commercial business loans totaling $19.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2016, as discussed above.

We also hold participations acquired through the through New Jersey Community Capital , formerly known as Thrift Institutions Community Investment Corporation of New Jersey ("TICIC"), a subsidiary of the New Jersey Bankers Association that is no longer actively originating loans. At June 30, 2016, our remaining TICIC participations included a total of 13 loans with an aggregate balance of $1.8 million representing loans on multi-family and commercial real estate properties.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Senior management recommends and the Board of Directors approves our lending policies and loan approval limits. Kearny Bank’s Loan Committee consists of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Regional President, Director of Commercial Real Estate Lending and Special Assets Manager. Our Chief Lending Officer may approve residential loans up to $750,000. Loan department personnel of Kearny Bank serving in the following positions may approve loans as follows: residential mortgage loan managers, mortgage loans up to $500,000; residential mortgage loan underwriters, mortgage loans up to $250,000; consumer loan managers, consumer loans up to $250,000; and consumer loan underwriters, consumer loans up to $150,000. In addition to these principal amount limits, there are established limits for different levels of approval authority as to minimum credit scores and maximum loan-to-value ratios and debt-to-income ratios or debt service coverage. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer have authorization to countersign loans for amounts that exceed $750,000 up to a limit of $1.0 million. Our Chief Lending Officer must approve loans between $750,000 and $1.0 million along with one of these designated officers. Non-conforming residential mortgage loans and loans over $1.0 million up to $2.0 million require the approval of the Loan Committee. The Committee may approve individual commercial loans or an aggregate commercial lending relationship up to $5.0 million. Commercial loans or aggregate relationships in excess of $5.0 million require approval by the Board of Directors while such approval is also required for residential mortgage loans in excess of $2.0 million and commercial business loans in excess of $1.0 million. 

Asset Quality

Collection Procedures on Delinquent Loans. We regularly monitor the payment status of all loans within our portfolio and promptly initiate collection efforts on past due loans in accordance with applicable policies and procedures. Delinquent borrowers are notified by both mail and telephone when a loan is 30 days past due. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts are made to contact the delinquent borrower and additional collection notices and letters are sent. All reasonable attempts are made to collect from borrowers prior to referral to an attorney for collection. However, when a loan is 90 days delinquent, it is our general practice to refer it to an attorney for repossession, foreclosure or other form of collection action, as appropriate. In certain instances, we may modify the loan or grant a limited moratorium on loan payments to enable the borrower to reorganize his or her financial affairs and we attempt to work with the borrower to establish a repayment schedule to cure the delinquency. 

As to mortgage loans, if a foreclosure action is taken and the loan is not reinstated, paid in full or refinanced, the property is sold at judicial sale at which we may be the buyer if there are no adequate offers to satisfy the debt. Any property acquired as the result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until it is sold or otherwise disposed of. When real estate owned is acquired, it is recorded at its fair market value less estimated selling costs. The initial write-down of the property, if necessary, is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Adjustments to the carrying value of the properties that result from subsequent declines in value are charged to operations in the period in which the declines are identified. 

Past Due Loans. A loan’s "past due" status is generally determined based upon its "P&amp;I delinquency" status in conjunction with its "past maturity" status, where applicable. A loan’s "P&amp;I delinquency" status is based upon the number of calendar days between the date of the earliest P&amp;I payment due and the "as of" measurement date. A loan’s "past maturity" status, where applicable, is based upon the number of calendar days between a loan’s contractual maturity date and the "as of" measurement date. Based upon the larger of these criteria, loans are categorized into the following "past due" tiers for financial statement reporting and disclosure purposes: Current (including 1-29 days past due), 30-59 days, 60-89 days and 90 or more days. 

Nonaccrual Loans. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractual payments become 90 days or more past due, and are otherwise placed on nonaccrual when we do not expect to receive all P&amp;I payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Loans that become 90 days past maturity, but remain non-delinquent with regard to ongoing P&amp;I payments, may remain on accrual status if: (1) we expect to receive all P&amp;I payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement, past maturity status notwithstanding, and (2) the borrower is working actively and cooperatively with us to remedy the past maturity status through an expected refinance, payoff or modification of the loan agreement that is not expected to result in a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR") classification. All TDRs are placed on nonaccrual status for a period of no less than six months after restructuring, irrespective of past due status. The sum of nonaccrual loans plus accruing loans that are 90 days or more past due are generally defined as "nonperforming loans." 

Payments received in cash on nonaccrual loans, including both the principal and interest portions of those payments, are generally applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan for financial statement purposes. When a loan is returned to accrual status, any accumulated interest payments previously applied to the carrying value of the loan during its nonaccrual period are recognized as interest income as an adjustment to the loan’s yield over its remaining term.

Loans that are not considered to be TDRs are generally returned to accrual status when payments due are brought current and we expect to receive all remaining P&amp;I payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Non-TDR loans may also be returned to accrual status when a loan’s payment status falls below 90 days past due and we: (1) expect receipt of the remaining past due amounts within a reasonable timeframe, and (2) expect to receive all remaining P&amp;I payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement.

TDRs on accrual status not included above totaled $2.9 million, $3.1 million, $3.3 million, $4.1 million and $2.6 million at June 30, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Total nonperforming assets decreased by $1.9 million to $21.9 million at June 30, 2016 from $23.8 million at June 30, 2015. The decrease comprised a net decline in nonperforming loans of $1.8 million plus a net decrease in real estate owned of $116,000. For those same comparative periods, the number of nonperforming loans decreased to 89 loans from 113 loans while the number of real estate owned properties increased to three from two.

At June 30, 2016, nonperforming loans comprised $21.0 million of "nonaccrual" loans and $38,000 of loans being reported as "accruing loans over 90 days past due." By comparison, at June 30, 2015, nonperforming loans comprised $22.9 million of "nonaccrual" loans with no loans being reported as "accruing loans over 90 days past due."

Nonperforming one- to four-family mortgage loans at June 30, 2016 include 41 nonaccrual loans totaling $10.7 million whose net outstanding balances range from $559 to $630,000, with an average balance of approximately $262,000 as of that date. The loans are in various stages of collection, workout or foreclosure. Of these loans, 38 are secured by New Jersey properties while two loans are secured by properties located in Staten Island, New York and one loan is secured by a property located in Savannah, Georgia. We have identified approximately $77,000 of specific impairment relating to eight of the nonperforming loans for which valuation allowances are maintained in the allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2016.

The number and balance of nonperforming one- to four-family mortgage loans at June 30, 2016 includes 28 loans totaling $8.1 million that were originally acquired from Countrywide with such loans comprising 38.6% of total nonperforming loans as of June 30, 2016. As of that same date, Kearny Bank owned a total of 51 residential mortgage loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $17.3 million that were originally acquired from Countrywide.

Nonperforming commercial real estate loans, including multi-family and nonresidential mortgage loans, include 17 nonaccrual loans totaling $6.8 million. At June 30, 2016, the outstanding balances of these loans range from $8,000 to $1.2 million with an 

average balance of approximately $400,000 as of that date. The loans are in various stages of collection, workout or foreclosure and are secured by New Jersey properties. We have identified approximately $53,000 of specific impairment relating to three of these nonperforming loans for which valuation allowances are maintained in the allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2016. 

Nonperforming commercial business loans at June 30, 2016 include 16 nonaccrual loans totaling $2.0 million. At June 30, 2016, the outstanding balances of these loans range from $6,000 to $392,000 with an average balance of approximately $123,000 as of that date. The loans are in various stages of collection, workout or foreclosure and are primarily secured by New Jersey and New York properties and, to a lesser extent, other forms of collateral. We have identified approximately $400,000 of specific impairment relating to nine of these nonperforming loans for which valuation allowances are maintained in the allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2016.

Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit that are reported as nonperforming at June 30, 2016 include 13 nonaccrual loans totaling $1.2 million. At June 30, 2016, the outstanding balances of these loans range from $11,000 to $473,000 with an average balance of approximately $90,000 as of that date. The loans are in various stages of collection, workout or foreclosure and are primarily secured by New Jersey properties. We have identified approximately $78,000 of specific impairment relating to two of these nonperforming loans for which valuation allowances are maintained in the allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2016.

Other consumer loans that are reported as nonperforming at June 30, 2016 include two unsecured loans totaling $38,000 reported as "accruing loans over 90 days past due."

Nonperforming construction loans include one nonaccrual loan totaling $357,000. The loan is in the workout stage and is secured by a New Jersey property. We have identified no specific impairment relating to this nonperforming loan at June 30, 2016.

During the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, gross interest income of $1.9 million, $1.8 million and $1.8 million, respectively, would have been recognized on loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis if those loans had been current. Interest income recognized on such loans of $80,000, $132,000 and $52,000 was included in income for the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

At June 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, Kearny Bank had loans with aggregate outstanding balances totaling $11.6 million, $8.7 million and $6.4 million, respectively, reported as troubled debt restructurings.

During the year ended June 30, 2016, gross interest income of $548,000 would have been recognized on loans reported as troubled debt restructurings under their original terms prior to restructuring. Actual interest income of $223,000 was recognized on such loans for the year ended June 30, 2016 reflecting the interest received under the revised terms of those restructured loans.

During the year ended June 30, 2015, gross interest income of $503,000 would have been recognized on loans reported as troubled debt restructurings under their original terms prior to restructuring. Actual interest income of $194,000 was recognized on such loans for the year ended June 30, 2015 reflecting the interest received under the revised terms of those restructured loans.

During the year ended June 30, 2014, gross interest income of $321,000 would have been recognized on loans reported as troubled debt restructurings under their original terms prior to restructuring. Actual interest income of $259,000 was recognized on such loans for the year ended June 30, 2014 reflecting the interest received under the revised terms of those restructured loans.

Loan Review System. We maintain a loan review system consisting of several related functions including, but not limited to, classification of assets, calculation of the allowance for loan losses, independent credit file review as well as internal audit and lending compliance reviews. We utilize both internal and external resources, where appropriate, to perform the various loan review functions. For example, we have engaged the services of a third party firm specializing in loan review and analysis to perform several loan review functions. The firm reviews the loan portfolio in accordance with the scope and frequency determined by senior management and the Asset Quality Committee of the Board of Directors. The third party loan review firm assists senior management and the Board of Directors in identifying potential credit weaknesses; in appropriately grading or adversely classifying loans; in identifying relevant trends that affect the collectability of the portfolio and identifying segments of the portfolio that are potential problem areas; in verifying the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses; in evaluating the activities of lending personnel including compliance with lending policies and the quality of their loan approval, monitoring and risk assessment; and by providing an objective assessment of the overall quality of the loan portfolio. Currently, independent loan reviews are being conducted quarterly and include non-performing loans as well as samples of performing loans of varying types within our portfolio. 

Our loan review system also includes the internal audit and compliance functions, which operate in accordance with a scope determined by the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. Internal audit resources assess the adequacy of, and adherence to, internal credit policies and loan administration procedures. Similarly, our compliance resources monitor adherence to 

relevant lending-related and consumer protection-related laws and regulations. The loan review system is structured in such a way that the internal audit function maintains the ability to independently audit other risk monitoring functions without impairing its independence with respect to these other functions. 

As noted, the loan review system also comprises our policies and procedures relating to the regulatory classification of assets and the allowance for loan loss functions each of which are described in greater detail below.

Classification of Assets. In compliance with the regulatory guidelines, our loan review system includes an evaluation process through which certain loans exhibiting adverse credit quality characteristics are classified "Special Mention", "Substandard", "Doubtful" or "Loss". 

An asset is classified as "Substandard" if it is inadequately protected by the paying capacity and net worth of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as "Doubtful" have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified as "Substandard", with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values. Assets, or portions thereof, classified as "Loss" are considered uncollectible or of so little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted.

Management evaluates loans classified as substandard or doubtful for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting requirements. As discussed in greater detail below, a valuation allowance is established through the provision for loan losses for any impairment identified through such evaluations. To the extent that impairment identified on a loan is classified as "Loss", that portion of the loan is charged off against the allowance for loan losses.

The classification of loan impairment as "Loss" is based upon a confirmed expectation for loss. For loans primarily secured by real estate, the expectation for loss is generally confirmed when: (a) impairment is identified on a loan individually evaluated in the manner described below, and (b) the loan is presumed to be collateral-dependent such that the source of loan repayment is expected to arise solely from sale of the collateral securing the applicable loan. Impairment identified on non-collateral-dependent loans may or may not be eligible for a "Loss" classification depending upon the other salient facts and circumstances that affect the manner and likelihood of loan repayment. Loan impairment that is classified as "Loss" is charged off against the ALLL concurrent with that classification.

The timeframe between when we first identify loan impairment and when such impairment may ultimately be charged off varies by loan type. For example, unsecured consumer and commercial loans are generally classified as "Loss" at 120 days past due, resulting in their outstanding balances being charged off at that time. For our secured loans, the condition of collateral dependency, as noted above, generally serves as the basis upon which a "Loss" classification is ascribed to a loan’s impairment thereby confirming an expected loss and triggering charge off of that impairment.

While the facts and circumstances that effect the manner and likelihood of repayment vary from loan to loan, we generally consider the referral of a loan to foreclosure, coupled with the absence of other viable sources of loan repayment, to be demonstrable evidence of collateral dependency. Depending upon the nature of the collections process applicable to a particular loan, an early determination of collateral dependency could result in a nearly concurrent charge off of a newly identified impairment. By contrast, a presumption of collateral dependency may only be determined after the completion of lengthy loan collection and/or workout efforts, including bankruptcy proceedings, which may extend several months or more after a loan’s impairment is first identified.

In a limited number of cases, the entire net carrying value of a loan may be determined to be impaired based upon a collateral-dependent impairment analysis. However, the borrower’s adherence to contractual repayment terms precludes the recognition of a "Loss" classification and charge off. In these limited cases, a valuation allowance equal to 100% of the impaired loan’s carrying value may be maintained against the net carrying value of the asset.

Assets which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification but have some credit deficiencies or other potential weaknesses are designated as "Special Mention" by management. Adversely classified assets, together with those rated as "Special Mention", are generally referred to as "Classified Assets". Non-classified assets are internally rated within one of four "Pass" categories or as "Watch" with the latter denoting a potential deficiency or concern that warrants increased oversight or tracking by management until remediated.

Management performs a classification of assets review, including the regulatory classification of assets, generally on a monthly basis. The results of the classification of assets review are validated by our third party loan review firm during their quarterly independent review. In the event of a difference in rating or classification between those assigned by the internal and external 

resources, we will generally utilize the more critical or conservative rating or classification. Final loan ratings and regulatory classifications are presented monthly to the Board of Directors and are reviewed by regulators during the examination process. 

The following table discloses our designation of certain loans as special mention or adversely classified during each of the five years presented.

Net of specific valuation allowances where applicable

At June 30, 2016, 23 loans were classified as Special Mention and 146 loans were classified as Substandard. As of that same date, three loans were classified as Doubtful. As noted above, all loans, or portions thereof, classified as Loss during fiscal 2016 were charged off against the allowance for loan losses.

Allowance for Loan Losses. Our allowance for loan loss calculation methodology utilizes a "two-tier" loss measurement process that is generally performed monthly. Based upon the results of the classification of assets and credit file review processes described earlier, we first identify the loans that must be reviewed individually for impairment. Factors considered in identifying individual loans to be reviewed include, but may not be limited to, loan type, classification status, contractual payment status, performance/accrual status and impaired status. 

The loans we consider to be eligible for individual impairment review include our commercial mortgage loans, comprising multi-family and nonresidential real estate loans, construction loans and commercial business loans as well as our one- to four-family mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit.

A reviewed loan is deemed to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Once a loan is determined to be impaired, management performs an analysis to determine the amount of impairment associated with that loan.

In measuring the impairment associated with collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral securing the loan is generally used as a measurement proxy for that of the impaired loan itself as a practical expedient. In the case of real estate collateral, such values are generally determined based upon a discounted market value obtained through an automated valuation module or prepared by a qualified, independent real estate appraiser. The value of non-real estate collateral is similarly determined based upon the independent assessment of fair market value by a qualified resource.

We generally obtain independent appraisals on properties securing mortgage loans when such loans are initially placed on nonperforming or impaired status with such values updated approximately every six to twelve months thereafter throughout the collections, bankruptcy and/or foreclosure processes. Appraised values are typically updated at the point of foreclosure, where applicable, and approximately every six to twelve months thereafter while the repossessed property is held as real estate owned.

As supported by accounting and regulatory guidance, we reduce the fair value of the collateral by estimated selling costs, such as real estate brokerage commissions, to measure impairment when such costs are expected to reduce the cash flows available to repay the loan.

We establish valuation allowances in the fiscal period during which the loan impairments are identified. The results of management’s individual loan impairment evaluations are validated by our third party loan review firm during their quarterly independent review. Such valuation allowances are adjusted in subsequent fiscal periods, where appropriate, to reflect any changes in carrying value or fair value identified during subsequent impairment evaluations which are generally updated monthly by management.

The second tier of the loss measurement process involves estimating the probable and estimable losses on loans not otherwise reviewed individually for impairment as well as those individually reviewed loans that are determined to be non-impaired. Such loans include groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans that may generally be excluded from individual impairment analysis, and 

therefore collectively evaluated for impairment, as well as the non-impaired loans within categories that are otherwise eligible for individual impairment review. 

Valuation allowances established through the second tier of the loss measurement process utilize historical and environmental loss factors to collectively estimate the level of probable losses within defined segments of our loan portfolio. These segments aggregate homogeneous subsets of loans with similar risk characteristics based upon loan type. For allowance for loan loss calculation and reporting purposes, we currently stratify our loan portfolio into seven primary segments: residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans, construction loans, commercial business loans, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans.

The risks presented by residential mortgage loans are primarily related to adverse changes in the borrower’s financial condition that threaten repayment of the loan in accordance with its contractual terms. Such risk to repayment can arise from job loss, divorce, illness and the personal bankruptcy of the borrower. For collateral dependent residential mortgage loans, additional risk of loss is presented by potential declines in the fair value of the collateral securing the loan.

Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit generally share the same risks as those applicable to residential mortgage loans. However, to the extent that such loans represent junior liens, they are comparatively more susceptible to such risks given their subordinate position behind senior liens.

In addition to sharing similar risks as those presented by residential mortgage loans, risks relating to commercial mortgage also arise from comparatively larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Moreover, the repayment of such loans is typically dependent on the successful operation of an underlying real estate project and may be further threatened by adverse changes to demand and supply of commercial real estate as well as changes generally impacting overall business or economic conditions.

The risks presented by construction loans are generally considered to be greater than those attributable to residential and commercial mortgage loans. Risks from construction lending arise, in part, from the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers and the effects of general economic conditions on developers and builders. Moreover, a construction loan can involve additional risks because of the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property's value at completion of the project and the estimated cost, including interest, of the project. The nature of these loans is such that they are comparatively more difficult to evaluate and monitor than permanent mortgage loans.

Commercial business loans are also considered to present a comparatively greater risk of loss due to the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and/or borrowers and the effects of general economic conditions on the business. Commercial business loans may be secured by varying forms of collateral including, but not limited to, business equipment, receivables, inventory and other business assets which may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance in the event of borrower default. Moreover, the repayment of commercial business loans is primarily dependent on the successful operation of the underlying business which may be threatened by adverse changes to the demand for the business’ products and/or services as well as the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the business’ operations and infrastructure.

Finally, our unsecured consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than other forms of lending but generally involve more credit risk due to the lack of collateral to secure the loan in the event of borrower default. Consumer loan repayment is dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability, and therefore is more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness and personal bankruptcy. By contrast, our consumer loans also include account loans that are fully secured by the borrower’s deposit accounts and generally present nominal risk to Kearny Bank.

Each primary segment is further stratified to distinguish between loans originated and purchased through third parties from loans acquired through business combinations. Commercial business loans include secured and unsecured loans as well as loans originated through SBA programs. Additional criteria may be used to further group loans with common risk characteristics. For example, such criteria may distinguish between loans secured by different collateral types or separately identify loans supported by government guarantees such as those issued by the SBA.

In regard to historical loss factors, our allowance for loan loss calculation calls for an analysis of historical charge-offs and recoveries for each of the defined segments within the loan portfolio. We currently utilize a two-year moving average of annual net charge-off rates (charge-offs net of recoveries) by loan segment, where available, to calculate our actual historical loss experience. The outstanding principal balance of the non-impaired portion of each loan segment is multiplied by the applicable historical loss factor to estimate the level of probable losses based upon our historical loss experience. 

As noted, the second tier of our allowance for loan loss calculation also utilizes environmental loss factors to estimate the probable losses within the loan portfolio. Environmental loss factors are based upon specific qualitative criteria representing key sources of risk within the loan portfolio. Such risk criteria have traditionally considered the level of and trends in nonperforming loans; the effects of changes in credit policy and lending strategy; the experience, ability and depth of the lending function’s management and staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; credit risk concentrations and changes in local and regional real estate values. During fiscal 2014, the environmental factors we utilize in our allowance for loan loss calculation were expanded to include changes in the nature, volume and terms of loans, changes in the quality of loan review systems and resources and the effects of regulatory, legal and other external factors. We regularly evaluate and update environmental loss factors, where appropriate, to best reflect the changes to the qualitative criteria used in our allowance for loan loss calculation methodology.

For each category of the loan portfolio, a level of risk, developed from a number of internal and external resources, is assigned to each of the qualitative criteria utilizing a scale that generally ranges from zero (negligible risk) to 15 (high risk) with higher values potentially ascribed to levels of risk that exceed the standard range, as appropriate. The sum of the risk values, expressed as a whole number, is multiplied by 0.01% to arrive at an overall environmental loss factor, expressed in basis points, for each loan category.

We have incorporated our credit-rating classification system into the calculation of environmental loss factors by loan type through the use of risk-rating classification "weights". Our existing risk-rating classification system ascribes a numerical rating of "1" through "9" to each loan within the portfolio. The ratings "5" through "9" represent the numerical equivalents of the traditional loan classifications "Watch", "Special Mention", "Substandard", "Doubtful" and "Loss", respectively, while lower ratings, "1" through "4", represent risk-ratings within the least risky "Pass" category. The environmental loss factor applicable to each non-impaired loan within a category, as described above, is "weighted" by a multiplier based upon the loan’s risk-rating classification. Within any single loan category, a "higher" environmental loss factor is ascribed to those loans with risk-rating classifications of "Watch" or higher resulting in a proportionately greater ALLL requirement attributable to such loans compared to the lower risk "Pass-rated" loans within that category.

The sum of the probable and estimable loan losses calculated through the first and second tiers of the loss measurement processes as described above, represents the total targeted balance for our allowance for loan losses at the end of a fiscal period. As noted earlier, we established all additional valuation allowances in the fiscal period during which additional individually identified loan impairments and additional estimated losses on loans collectively evaluated for impairment are identified. We adjust our balance of valuation allowances through the provision for loan losses as required to ensure that the balance of the allowance for loan losses reflects all probable and estimable loans losses at the close of the fiscal period. Notwithstanding calculation methodology and the noted distinction between valuation allowances established on loans collectively versus individually evaluated for impairment, our entire allowance for loan losses is available to cover all charge-offs that arise from the loan portfolio.

Although we believe that our allowance for loans losses is established in accordance with management’s best estimate, actual losses are dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of loan loss allowances may be necessary.

The following table sets forth information with respect to activity in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.

During the year ended June 30, 2016, the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased by $8.6 million to $24.2 million or 0.91% of total loans at June 30, 2016 from $15.6 million or 0.74% of total loans at June 30, 2015. The increase resulted from provisions of $10.7 million during the year ended June 30, 2016 that were partially offset by charge-offs, net of recoveries, totaling $2.1 million.

With regard to loans individually evaluated for impairment, the balance of our allowance for loan losses attributable to such loans decreased by $443,000 to $608,000 at June 30, 2016 from $1.1 million at June 30, 2015. The balance at June 30, 2016 reflected the allowance for impairment identified on $3.2 million of impaired loans while an additional $21.9 million of impaired loans had no allowance for impairment as of that date. By comparison, the balance at June 30, 2015 reflected the allowance for impairment identified on $5.6 million of impaired loans while an additional $28.0 million of impaired loans had no allowance for impairment as of that date. The outstanding balances of impaired loans reflect the cumulative effects of various adjustments including, but not limited to, purchase accounting valuations and prior charge-offs, where applicable, which are considered in the evaluation of impairment.

With regard to loans evaluated collectively for impairment, the balance of our allowance for loan losses attributable to such loans increased by $9.0 million to $23.6 million at June 30, 2016 from $14.6 million at June 30, 2015. The increase in valuation was partly attributable to a $577.3 million increase in the aggregate outstanding balance of loans collectively evaluated for impairment to $2.65 billion at June 30, 2016 from $2.07 billion at June 30, 2015 as well as the ongoing reallocation of loans within the portfolio in favor of commercial loans against which we generally assign comparatively higher historical and environmental loss factors in our ALLL calculation. The increase in the allowance also reflected increases in certain environmental and historical loss factors during the year ended June 30, 2016.

With regard to historical loss factors, our loan portfolio experienced a net annualized charge-off rate of 0.08% for the year ended June 30, 2016 representing a decrease of eight basis points from the 0.16% of charge offs reported for the year ended June 30, 2015. 

The annual average net charge off rate for June 30, 2015 had previously increased by four basis points from 0.12% for the prior year ended June 30, 2014. Given the effects of these annual changes, the two-year average net charge off rate for our loan portfolio decreased by two basis points to 0.12% for the period ended June 30, 2016 from 0.14% for the period ended June 30, 2015. The historical loss factors used in our allowance for loan loss calculation methodology were updated to reflect the effect of these changes by individual loan segment reflecting the two year look-back period used by that methodology. 

The effect of the aggregate decline in the two-year average charge-off rate for fiscal 2016 on the historical loss factors was partially offset by an increase in certain estimated historical loss factors ascribed to our newer, unseasoned loan segments for which a full, two-year charge-off history is not yet available. In such cases, we generally utilize estimated annual charge-off rates to develop the historical loss factors applicable to such segments. Loan segments utilizing estimated charge-off rates for the year ended June 30, 2016 included our wholesale C&amp;I loan participations and our consumer loans acquired through Lending Club, as described earlier. The historical loss factors for these newer portfolios were periodically reviewed and updated during fiscal 2016 resulting in an increase in the estimated charge off rates applicable to the loans within those segments.

The effects of the increase in the overall balance of the unimpaired portion of the loan portfolio more than offset the effect of the net decrease in historical loss factors arising from the changes noted above. In total, these factors resulted in a net increase of $1.5 million in the applicable portion of the allowance to $3.4 million as of June 30, 2016 compared to $1.9 million as of June 30, 2015.

In addition to updating historical loss factors, we also modified the following environmental loss factors during the year ended June 30, 2016 to reflect the increased level of risk exposure and estimated losses primarily arising from the continued growth and diversification within in the noted segments of our loan portfolio and the supporting changes to lending strategies and infrastructure that we enacted during the year to support those objectives:

- Concentration of credit: Increase loss factor within the following originated loan segments to reflect increased exposure to one or more of the following concentration-related risks: (a) increase in origination and/or purchase of larger loan amount to individual borrowers and, (b) increase in origination and/or purchase of loans collateralized by real estate located in New Jersey and the five boroughs of New York City. 

-  Nonresidential mortgage loans 

-  Multi-family mortgage loans 

- Changes in the nature, volume and terms of loans: Increase loss factor within the following originated loan segments to reflect accelerating growth and resulting in additional risk attributable to decreased aggregate seasoning and performance history of loans and borrowers in segment. 

-  Nonresidential mortgage loans 

-  Multi-family mortgage loans 

- Changes in collateral values: Increased the loss factor within the following loan segment to reflect sustained increase in property values servicing as collateral for loans and resulting risk of potential market correction to such collateral values. 

-  Multi-family mortgage loans 

- Changes in national and local economic trends and conditions: Increased the loss factor within the following loan segment to reflect continued softness in national and regional economic trends that may have an adverse impact on rental market and property values in markets served by Company. 

-  Multi-family mortgage loans 

- Changes in credit policies and strategies: Increase loss factor within the following originated loan segments to reflect changes in credit policies and lending practices arising from organizational changes within commercial business lending function. 

-  Commercial business loans 

- Experience, ability and depth of lending resources: Increase loss factor within the following originated loan segment to reflect changes in lending management and staff arising from organizational changes within commercial business lending function. 

-  Commercial business loans 

In addition to the changes noted above, we also established an initial set of environmental loss factors to the loan segment containing the unsecured consumer loans acquired from Lending Club during fiscal 2016, as described earlier. Such loss factors generally reflect the increased risk arising from the implementation of the new consumer lending strategy. 

- 

Consumer Loans (Lending Club) 

-  Changes in credit policies and strategies

-  National and local economic trends and conditions

-  Changes in the nature, volume and terms of loans

-  Experience, ability and depth of lending resources

-  Levels and trends of nonperforming loans

-  Concentration of credit

Changes to environmental loss factors during the year ended June 30, 2016 also reflected updates applicable to loans originally acquired through our prior acquisitions of other financial institutions. In general, such loans are recorded at fair value at acquisition reflecting any impairment identified on such loans at that time. During fiscal 2016, we evaluated and adjusted our estimates of "post-acquisition" impairment attributable to our portfolios of acquired loans. Such impairment is reflected in the environmental loss factors used to calculate the required allowance applicable to the non-impaired portion of our acquired loan portfolios.

Given their original acquisition at fair value, the environmental loss factors ascribed to loans acquired through business combinations partly reflect the effect of portfolio seasoning on the estimated level of impairment attributed to those portfolios since their acquisition. The level of environmental loss factors attributable to all acquired loans will continue to be monitored and adjusted to reflect our best judgment as to the level of incurred "post- acquisition" impairment.

Finally, changes to environmental loss factors during the year ended June 30, 2016 also reflected updates to the "risk weighting multipliers" used in the Company’s allowance for loan loss calculation methodology to "weight" the environmental loss factors ascribed to loans based on their risk-rating classification, as described earlier. Such updates standardized the environmental loss factor "weights" applicable to all loans within the four "pass-rated" tiers of a loan segment.

The noted changes in environmental loss factors coupled with the concurrent increase in the overall balance of the unimpaired portion of the loan portfolio resulted in a net increase of $7.5 million in the applicable portion of the allowance to $20.2 million at June 30, 2016 compared to $12.6 million as of June 30, 2015.

An overview of the balances and activity within the allowance for loan loss during the prior fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 largely reflects the effects of the overall growth and reallocation of the loan portfolio arising from our increased strategic emphasis on commercial lending. Secondarily, the overview also reflects a consistent improvement in asset quality and reduction in specific loan-level impairment losses due to the slow recovery of economic and market conditions from the adverse effects of the 2008-2009 financial crisis which had previously impacted credit quality within our loan portfolio.

In that regard, the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased by approximately $3.2 million to $15.6 million at June 30, 2015 from $12.4 million at June 30, 2014. The increase resulted from provisions of $6.1 million that were partially offset by net charge offs of $2.9 million during fiscal 2015. Valuation allowances attributable to impairment identified on individually evaluated loans decreased by $622,000 to $1.1 million at June 30, 2015 from $1.7 million at June 30, 2014. For those same comparative periods, valuation allowances on loans evaluated collectively for impairment increased by approximately $3.8 million to $14.6 million from $10.7 million reflecting the overall growth in the balance of non-impaired loans in the portfolio in conjunction with changes to the historical and environmental loss factors used in the allowance for loan loss calculation during the year.

The calculation of probable losses within a loan portfolio and the resulting allowance for loan losses is subject to estimates and assumptions that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available and as events or conditions effecting individual borrowers and the marketplace as a whole change over time. Future additions to the allowance for loan losses will likely be necessary if economic and market conditions do not improve in the future from those currently prevalent in the marketplace. In addition, the federal banking regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios and the related allowance for loan losses and valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate. The regulators may require the allowance for loan losses to be increased based on their review of information available at the time of the examination, which may negatively affect our earnings.

Securities Portfolio 

Our deposits and borrowings have traditionally exceeded our outstanding balance of loans receivable. We have generally invested excess funds into investment securities with a historical emphasis on U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and U.S. agency debentures. Such assets are a significant component of our investment portfolio at June 30, 2016 and are expected to remain so in the future. However, enhancements to our investment policies, strategies and infrastructure in recent years have enabled us to diversify the composition and allocation of our securities portfolio as described below.

At June 30, 2016, our securities portfolio totaled $1.25 billion and comprised 27.9% of our total assets. By comparison, at June 30, 2015, our securities portfolio totaled $1.43 billion and comprised 33.8% of our total assets.

The year-over-year net decrease in the securities portfolio totaled approximately $179.8 million, which largely reflected security repayments during the year that were partially offset by security purchases. The decrease in the portfolio also reflected a $4.6 million decrease in the fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio to an unrealized loss of $4.7 million at June 30, 2016 from an unrealized loss of $147,000 at June 30, 2015.

The decrease in the securities portfolio from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2015 generally reflects the stated goals and objectives of our business plan which continues to call for shifting the mix of our earning assets toward greater balances of loans and lesser balances of securities.

Our investment policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors, is designed to foster earnings and manage cash flows within prudent interest rate risk and credit risk guidelines. Generally, our investment policy is to invest funds in various categories of securities and maturities based upon our liquidity needs, asset/liability management policies, investment quality, and marketability and performance objectives. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer are the senior management members of our Capital Markets Committee ("CMC") that are generally designated by the Board of Directors as the officers primarily responsible for securities portfolio management and all transactions require the approval of at least two of these designated officers. The Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of the securities portfolio and the CMC’s activities relating thereto.

The investments authorized for purchase under the investment policy approved by our Board of Directors include U.S. government and agency mortgage-backed securities (including U.S. agency commercial MBS), U.S. government and government agency debentures, municipal obligations (consisting of bank-qualified municipal bond obligations of state and local governments), corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations. We also hold small balances of single-issuer trust preferred securities and non-agency mortgage-backed securities that were acquired through bank acquisitions, but generally do not purchase such securities for the portfolio. On a short-term basis, our investment policy authorizes investment in securities purchased under agreements to resell, federal funds, certificates of deposits of insured banks and savings institutions and Federal Home Loan Bank term deposits.

The carrying value of our mortgage-backed securities totaled $693.7 million at June 30, 2016 and comprised 55.5% of total investments and 15.5% of total assets as of that date. Mortgage-backed securities generally include mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations that are typically issued with stated principal amounts and backed by pools of mortgage loans. Mortgage originators use intermediaries (generally government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, but also a variety of non-agency corporate issuers) to pool and package mortgage loans into mortgage-backed securities. The cash flow and re-pricing characteristics of a mortgage pass-through security generally approximate those of the underlying mortgages. By comparison, the cash flow and re-pricing characteristics of collateralized mortgage obligations are determined by those assigned to an individual security, or "tranche", within the terms of a larger investment vehicle which allocates cash flows to its component tranches based upon a predetermined structure as payments are received from the underlying mortgagors.

We generally invest in mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies or government-sponsored entities, such as the Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae"), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") and the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae"). Mortgage-backed securities issued or sponsored by U.S. government agencies and government-sponsored entities are guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest to investors. Mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than the mortgage loans underlying such securities because of the costs of servicing and of their payment guarantees or credit enhancements which minimize the level of credit risk to the security holder.

In addition to those mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. agencies and GSEs, the Company held a total of five non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations with an aggregate carrying value totaling $157,000 at June 30, 2016. During the year ended June 30, 2014, non-agency CMOs totaling $34,000 fell below our investment grade threshold triggering their sale and resulting in sale losses totaling $6,000 for that year. There were no sales of non-agency CMO’s during the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. All non-agency CMOs were nominally impaired at June 30, 2016, but maintained their credit-ratings at levels supporting our investment grade assessment with such ratings equaling or exceeding "BBB+" by Standard &amp; Poor’s Financial Services ("S&amp;P") and/or "Baa2" by Moody’s Investor Service ("Moody’s"), where rated by those agencies. 

The carrying value of our U.S. agency debt securities totaled $91.4 million at June 30, 2016 and comprised 7.3% of total investments and 2.0% of total assets as of that date. Such securities included $85.0 million of fixed-rate U.S. agency debentures as well as $6.4 million of securitized pools of loans issued and fully guaranteed by the SBA.

The carrying value of our securities representing obligations of state and political subdivisions totaled $110.6 million at June 30, 2016 and comprised 8.8% of total investments and 2.5% of total assets as of that date. Such securities primarily included highly-rated, fixed-rate bank-qualified securities representing general obligations of municipalities located within the U.S. or the obligations of their related entities such as boards of education or school districts. The portfolio also includes a nominal balance of non-rated municipal obligations totaling approximately $3.4 million comprising ten short-term, bond anticipation notes ("BANs") issued by a total of five New Jersey municipalities. Each of our municipal obligations were consistently rated by Moody’s and S&amp;P well above the thresholds that generally support our investment grade assessment with such ratings equaling or exceeding "A" or higher by S&amp;P and/or "A3" or higher by Moody’s, where rated by those agencies. In the absence of such ratings, we rely upon our own internal analysis of the issuer’s financial condition to validate its investment grade assessment.

The carrying value of our asset-backed securities totaled $82.6 million at June 30, 2016 and comprised 6.6% of total investments and 1.8% of total assets as of that date. This category of securities is comprised entirely of structured, floating-rate securities representing securitized federal education loans with 97% U.S. government guarantees. The securities represent tranches of a larger investment vehicle designed to reallocate credit risk among the individual tranches comprised within that vehicle. Through this process, investors in different tranches are subject to varying degrees of risk that the cash flows of their tranche will be adversely impacted by borrowers defaulting on the underlying loans. Our securities represent the highest credit-quality tranches within the overall structures with each being rated "AA+" by S&amp;P at June 30, 2016.

The outstanding balance of our collateralized loan obligations totaled $127.4 million at June 30, 2016 and comprised 10.2% of total investments and 2.8% of total assets as of that date. This category of securities is comprised entirely of structured, floating-rate securities comprised of securitized commercial loans to large, U.S. corporations. Our securities represent tranches of a larger investment vehicle designed to reallocate cash flows and credit risk among the individual tranches comprised within that vehicle. Through this process, investors in different tranches are subject to varying degrees of risk that the cash flows of their tranche will be adversely impacted by borrowers defaulting on the underlying loans. At June 30, 2016, each of our collateralized loan obligations were consistently rated by Moody’s and S&amp;P well above the thresholds that generally support our investment grade assessment with such ratings equaling or exceeding "AA" or higher by S&amp;P and/or "Aa2" or higher by Moody’s, where rated by those agencies.

The carrying value of our corporate bonds totaled $137.4 million at June 30, 2016 and comprised 11.0% of total investments and 3.1% of total assets as of that date. This category of securities is comprised entirely of floating-rate corporate debt obligations issued by large financial institutions. Such issuers include domestic institutions, such as The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., General Electric Capital Corporation, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Wells Fargo and Co., as well as non-domestic financial institutions such as Barclays Bank PLC and Deutsche Bank AG. The Company generally limits its investment in the unsecured corporate debt of any single issuer to $25.0 million. At June 30, 2016, each of our corporate bonds were consistently rated by Moody’s and S&amp;P well above the thresholds that generally support our investment grade assessment with such ratings equaling or exceeding "BBB+" or higher by S&amp;P and/or "Baa2" or higher by Moody’s, where rated by those agencies.

The carrying value of our trust preferred securities totaled $7.7 million at June 30, 2016 and comprised less than one percent of total investments and total assets as of that date. The category comprises a total of five "single-issuer" (i.e. non-pooled) trust preferred securities that were originally issued by four separate financial institutions. As a result of bank mergers involving the issuers of these securities, our five trust preferred securities currently represent the de-facto obligations of three separate financial institutions. At June 30, 2016, two of the securities at an amortized cost of $3.0 million were consistently rated by Moody’s and S&amp;P above the thresholds that generally support our investment grade assessment, with such ratings equaling "BBB-" by S&amp;P and "Baa2" by Moody’s. The securities were originally issued through Chase Capital II and currently represent de-facto obligations of JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. We also owned two trust preferred securities at an amortized cost of $4.9 million whose external credit ratings by both S&amp;P and Moody’s fell below the thresholds that we normally associate with investment grade securities, with such ratings equaling "BB+" by S&amp;P and "Ba1" by Moody’s. The securities were originally issued through BankBoston Capital Trust IV and MBNA Capital B and currently represent de-facto obligations of Bank of America Corporation. We hold one non-rated trust preferred security with a par value of $1.0 million representing a de-facto obligation of Mercantil Commercebank Florida Bancorp, Inc.

Current accounting standards require that securities be categorized as "held to maturity", "trading securities" or "available for sale", based on management’s intent as to the ultimate disposition of each security. These standards allow debt securities to be classified as "held to maturity" and reported in financial statements at amortized cost only if the reporting entity has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Securities that might be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in the security’s prepayment risk, increases in loan demand, or other similar factors cannot be classified as "held to maturity". 

We do not currently use or maintain a trading account. Securities not classified as "held to maturity" are classified as "available for sale". These securities are reported at fair value and unrealized gains and losses on the securities are excluded from earnings and reported, net of deferred taxes, as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of equity. As of June 30, 2016, our held to maturity securities portfolio had a carrying value of $577.3 million or 46.2 % of our total securities with the remaining $673.5 million or 53.8% of securities classified as available for sale.

Other than mortgage-backed or debt securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies, we did not hold securities of any one issuer having an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of our equity at June 30, 2016. All of our securities carry market risk insofar as increases in market rates of interest may cause a decrease in their market value. We have determined that none of our securities with unrealized losses at June 30, 2016 are other than temporarily impaired as of that date.

Purchases of securities are made based on certain considerations, which include the interest rate, tax considerations, volatility, yield, settlement date and maturity of the security, our liquidity position and anticipated cash needs and sources. The effect that the proposed security would have on our credit and interest rate risk and risk-based capital is also considered. We do not purchase securities that are determined to be below investment grade.

There were no sales of securities available for sale during year ended June 30, 2016. During the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, proceeds from sales of securities available for sale totaled $57.2 million and $170.9 million, which resulted in gross gains of $601,000 and $3.6 million and gross losses of $594,000 and $2.1 million, respectively. There were no sales of held to maturity securities during the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Proceeds from sale of securities held to maturity during the year ended June 30, 2014 totaled $28,000 resulting in gross losses of $6,000. 

The following table sets forth the carrying value of our securities portfolio at the dates indicated. Mortgage-backed securities include mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations.

Sources of Funds 

General. Retail deposits are our primary source of funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition, we derive funds from loan and mortgage&#8209;backed securities principal repayments and proceeds from the maturities and calls of non-mortgage-backed securities. Loan and securities payments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Wholesale funding sources including, but not limited to, borrowings from the FHLB of New York, wholesale deposits and other short term-borrowings are also used to supplement the funding for loans and investments. 

Deposits. Our current deposit products include interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit accounts ranging in terms from 30 days to five years. Certificates of deposit with terms ranging from one year to five years are available for individual retirement account plans. Deposit account terms, such as interest rate earned, applicability of certain fees and service charges and funds accessibility, will vary based upon several factors including, but not limited to, minimum balance, term to maturity, and transaction frequency and form requirements. 

Deposits are obtained primarily from within New Jersey and New York through Kearny Bank’s network of retail branches. Traditional methods of advertising are used to attract new customers and deposits, including radio, print media, outdoor advertising, direct mail and inserts included with customer statements. Premiums or incentives for opening accounts are sometimes offered. One of our key retail products in recent years has been "Star Banking", which bundles a number of banking services and products together for those customers with a checking account with direct deposit and combined deposits of $20,000 or more, including Internet banking, bill pay, mobile banking, telephone banking and a 15 basis point premium on certificates of deposit with a term of at least one year, excluding special promotions. We also offer "High Yield Checking" which is primarily designed to attract core deposits in the form of customers’ primary checking accounts through interest rate and fee reimbursement incentives to qualifying customers. The comparatively higher interest expense associated with the "High Yield Checking" product in relation to our other checking products is partially offset by the transaction fee income associated with the account.

We may also offer a 15 basis point premium on certificate of deposit accounts with a term of at least one year, excluding special promotions, to certificate of deposit accountholders that have $500,000 or more on deposit with Kearny Bank. Though certificates of deposit with non-standard maturities are popular in our market, we generally promote certificates of deposit with traditional maturities, including three and six months and one, two, three, four and five years. During the term of our non-standard 17-month and 29-month certificates of deposit, we offer customers a "one-time option" to "step up" the rate paid from the original rate set on the certificate to the current rate being offered by Kearny Bank for certificates of that particular maturity.

The determination of interest rates on retail deposits is based upon a number of factors, including: (1) our need for funds based on loan demand, current maturities of deposits and other cash flow needs; (2) a current survey of a selected group of competitors’ rates for similar products; (3) our current cost of funds, yield on assets and asset/liability position; and (4) the alternate cost of funds on a wholesale basis. Interest rates are generally reviewed by senior management on a bi-weekly basis.

We also utilize "non-retail" deposits as an alternative source of wholesale funding to traditional borrowings such as FHLB advances. Such funds are generally used to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and liquidity risk in conjunction with our overall asset/liability management process. At June 30, 2016, the balance of our interest-bearing checking accounts includes a total of $224.1 million of brokered money market deposits acquired through Promontory Interfinancial Network’s ("Promontory") Insured Network Deposits ("IND") program, a brokered deposit network that is sourced by Promontory from large retail and institutional brokerage firms whose individual clients seek to have a portion of their investments held in interest-bearing accounts at FDIC-insured institutions. The terms of the program generally establish a reciprocal commitment for Promontory to deliver and Kearny Bank to accept such deposits for a period of no less than five years during which time total aggregate balances shall be maintained within a range of $200.0 million to $230.0 million. Such deposits are generally sourced by Promontory from large retail and institutional brokerage firms whose individual clients seek to have a portion of their investments held in interest-bearing accounts at FDIC-insured institutions.

We also acquired a small portfolio of longer-term, brokered certificates of deposit during fiscal 2014 whose balances and weighted average remaining term to maturity totaled approximately $8.4 million and 14.8 years, respectively, at June 30, 2016. In combination with Promontory IND money market deposits noted above, Kearny Bank’s brokered deposits totaled $232.5 million, or 8.6% of deposits, at June 30, 2016.

We also utilize the QwickRate deposit listing service to attract "non-brokered" wholesale time deposits targeting institutional investors with a three-to-five year investment horizon. The balance of time deposits we acquired through the QwickRate listing totaled $89.9 million, or 3.3% of deposits, at June 30, 2016 with such funds having a weighted average remaining term to maturity of 3.0 years. We generally prohibit the withdrawal of our listing service deposits prior to maturity.

Additional sources of non-retail deposits including, but not limited to, deposits acquired through listing services and other sources of brokered deposits, may be utilized in the future as additional, alternative sources of wholesale funding. 

A large percentage of our deposits are in certificates of deposit, which represented 44.8% and 40.6% of total deposits at June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. Our liquidity could be reduced if a significant amount of certificates of deposit maturing within a short period were not renewed. At June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, certificates of deposit maturing within one year were $666.1 million and $526.5 million, respectively. Historically, a significant portion of the certificates of deposit remain with us after they mature and we believe that this will continue.

At June 30, 2016, $661.0 million or 54.7% of our certificates of deposit were certificates of $100,000 or more compared to $489.2 million or 48.8% at June 30, 2015. The general level of market interest rates and money market conditions significantly influence deposit inflows and outflows. The effects of these factors are particularly pronounced on deposit accounts with larger balances. In particular, certificates of deposit with balances of $100,000 or greater are traditionally viewed as being a more volatile source of funding than comparatively lower balance certificates of deposit or non-maturity transaction accounts. In order to retain certificates of deposit with balances of $100,000 or more, we may have to pay a premium rate, resulting in an increase in our cost of funds. In a rising rate environment, we may be unwilling or unable to pay a competitive rate. To the extent that such deposits do not remain with us, they may need to be replaced with borrowings, which could increase our cost of funds and negatively impact our interest rate spread and our financial condition.

The following table sets forth the distribution of average deposits for the periods indicated and the weighted average nominal interest rates for each period on each category of deposits presented.

Borrowings. The sources of wholesale funding we utilize include borrowings in the form of advances from the FHLB of New York as well as other forms of borrowings. We generally use wholesale funding to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and liquidity risk in conjunction with our overall asset/liability management process. Toward that end, FHLB advances are primarily utilized to extend the duration of funding to partially offset the interest rate risk presented by our investment in longer-term fixed-rate loans and mortgage-backed securities. Extending the duration of funding may be achieved by simply utilizing fixed-rate borrowings with longer terms to maturity. Alternately, we may utilize derivatives such as interest rate swaps and caps in conjunction with either short-term fixed-rate or floating-rate borrowings to effectively extend the duration of those funding sources. 

Advances from the FHLB are typically secured by our FHLB capital stock and certain investment securities as well as residential and multi-family mortgage loans that we choose to utilize as collateral for such borrowings. Additional information regarding our FHLB advances is included under Note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements.

Short&#8209;term FHLB advances generally have original maturities of less than one year and may also include overnight borrowings which Kearny Bank may utilize to address short term funding needs, where applicable. At June 30, 2016, we had a total of $425.0 million of short-term FHLB advances at a weighted average interest rate of 0.69%. Such advances represented 90-day FHLB term advances that are generally forecasted to be periodically redrawn at maturity for the same 90 day term as the original advance. Based on this presumption, we utilized interest rate swaps to effectively extend the duration of each of these advances at the time they were drawn to effectively fix their cost for a period of five years. Our balance of short-term FHLB advances at June 30, 2016 included no overnight borrowings drawn for daily liquidity management purposes.

Long-term advances generally include term advances with original maturities of greater than one year. At June 30, 2016, our outstanding balance of long-term FHLB advances totaled $153.8 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.94%. Such advances included $145.0 million of callable advances at a weighted average interest rate of 3.04%, $8.2 million of non-callable, term advances at a weighted average interest rate of 1.13% and an amortizing advance of $572,000 at an interest rate of 4.94%.

Based upon the market value of investment securities and mortgage loans that are posted as collateral for FHLB advances at June 30, 2016, we are eligible to borrow up to an additional $407.6 million of advances from the FHLB as of that date. We are further authorized to post additional collateral in the form of other unencumbered investments securities and eligible mortgage loans that may expand our borrowing capacity with the FHLB up to 30% of our total assets. Additional borrowing capacity up to 50% of our total assets may be authorized with the approval of the FHLB’s Board of Directors or Executive Committee.

The balance of borrowings at June 30, 2016 also included overnight borrowings in the form of depositor sweep accounts totaling $35.6 million. Depositor sweep accounts are short-term borrowings representing funds that are withdrawn from a customer’s non-interest bearing deposit account and invested in an uninsured overnight investment account that is collateralized by specified investment securities owned by Kearny Bank.

Interest Rate Derivatives and Hedging

We utilize derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps and caps to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk in conjunction with our overall asset/liability management process. In accordance with accounting requirements, we formally designate all of our hedging relationships as either fair value hedges, intended to offset the changes in the value of certain financial instruments due to movements in interest rates, or cash flow hedges, intended to offset changes in the cash flows of certain financial instruments due to movement in interest rates, and documents the strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions and its method of assessing ongoing effectiveness.

At June 30, 2016, our derivative instruments are comprised entirely of interest rate swaps and caps with total notional amounts of $500.0 million and $125.0 million, respectively with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Bank of Montreal serving as the counterparties to the transactions. These instruments are intended to manage the interest rate exposure relating to certain wholesale funding positions drawn at June 30, 2016.

Additional information regarding our use of interest rate derivatives and our hedging activities is presented in Note 1 and Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements.

Subsidiary Activity

At June 30, 2016, Kearny Bank was the only wholly-owned operating subsidiary of Kearny Financial Corp. As of that date, Kearny Bank had two wholly owned subsidiaries: KFS Financial Services, Inc. and CJB Investment Corp.

KFS Financial Services, Inc. is a service corporation subsidiary originally organized for selling insurance products to Kearny Bank customers and the general public through a third party networking arrangement. KFS Financial Services, Inc. has one wholly-owned subsidiary named, KFS Insurance Services, Inc., that was created for the primary purpose of acquiring insurance agencies. Both KFS Financial Services Inc. and KFS Insurance Services, Inc. were considered inactive during the year ended June 30, 2016.

CJB Investment Corp. is a New Jersey Investment Company and remained active through the three-year period ended June 30, 2016.

Personnel 

As of June 30, 2016, we had 416 full&#8209;time employees and 43 part&#8209;time employees equating to a total of 438 full time equivalent ("FTE") employees. By comparison, at June 30, 2015, we had 424 full-time employees and 67 part-time employees equating to a total of 458 FTEs. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and we consider our working relationship with our employees to be good.

REGULATION 

General

Kearny Bank and Kearny Financial operate in a highly regulated industry. This regulation establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings and loan holding company and federal savings bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and depositors. Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws that relate to the regulation of Kearny Bank and Kearny Financial. The description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations.

Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution and its holding company, the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution’s allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, including changes in the regulations governing savings and loan holding companies, could have a material adverse impact on Kearny Financial, Kearny Bank and their operations. The adoption of regulations or the enactment of laws that restrict the operations of Kearny Bank and/or Kearny Financial or impose burdensome requirements upon one or both of them could reduce their profitability and could impair the value of Kearny Bank’s franchise, resulting in negative effects on the trading price of our common stock.

Regulation of Kearny Bank

General. As a federally-chartered savings bank with deposits insured by the FDIC, Kearny Bank is subject to extensive regulation by federal banking regulators, primarily the OCC, its primary regulator. This regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies regarding the classification of assets and the level of the allowance for loan losses. The activities of federal savings banks are subject to extensive regulation including restrictions or requirements with respect to loans to one borrower, the percentage of non&#8209;mortgage loans or investments to total assets, capital distributions, permissible investments and lending activities, liquidity, transactions with affiliates and community reinvestment. Federal savings banks are also subject to reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve Board. Both state and federal law regulate a federal savings bank’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers, especially in such matters as the ownership of savings accounts and the form and content of Kearny Bank’s mortgage documents. 

Kearny Bank must file reports with the OCC concerning its activities and financial condition and obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. The OCC regularly examines Kearny Bank and prepares reports to Kearny Bank’s Board of Directors on deficiencies, if any, found in its operations. The OCC has substantial discretion to take enforcement action with respect to an institution that fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or engages in violations of law or unsafe and unsound practices. Such actions can include, among others, the issuance of a cease and desist order, assessment of civil money penalties, removal of officers and directors and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. In addition, the FDIC has the authority to recommend to the Comptroller of the Currency to take enforcement action with respect to a particular federally-chartered savings bank and, if the Comptroller does not take action, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain circumstances.

Federal Deposit Insurance. Kearny Bank’s deposits are insured to applicable limits by the FDIC. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the maximum deposit insurance amount was permanently increased from $100,000 to $250,000. 

The FDIC has adopted a risk-based premium system that provides for quarterly assessments. Assessments are based on an insured institution’s classification among four risk categories determined from their examination ratings and capital and other financial ratios. The institution is assigned to a category and the category determines its assessment rate, subject to certain specified risk adjustments. Insured institutions deemed to pose less risk to the deposit insurance fund pay lower assessments, while greater risk institutions pay higher assessments.

In February 2011, the FDIC published a final rule under the Dodd-Frank Act to reform the deposit insurance assessment system. Under the rule, assessments are based on an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity instead of deposits, which was the FDIC’s prior practice. The rule revised the assessment rate schedule to establish assessments ranging from 2.5 to 45 basis points, based on an institution’s risk classification and possible risk adjustments.

In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation ("FICO") is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.56 of a basis point of total assets less tangible capital.

The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by June 30, 2020. It is intended that insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more will fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving the maximum ratio to the discretion of the FDIC. The FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-term goal of a fund ratio of 2.0%. 

The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Kearny Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.

Regulatory Capital Requirements. OCC regulations require federal savings banks to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8%, and a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

As noted, the capital standards for federal savings banks require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively, and a leverage ratio of at least 4% Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 

In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four- family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to equity interests depending on certain specified factors.

Federal savings banks must also meet a statutory "tangible capital" standard of 1.5% of average total assets. Tangible capital is generally defined as Tier 1 capital plus the amount of perpetual preferred stock not included in Tier 1 capital. 

In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a "capital conservation buffer" consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 

In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the OCC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary.

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires that federal bank regulatory authorities take "prompt corrective action" with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 

The OCC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. The regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. An institution is deemed to be "well capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is "adequately capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is "undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be "significantly undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be "critically undercapitalized" if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. 

"Undercapitalized" banks must adhere to growth, capital distribution (including dividend) and other limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. A bank’s compliance with such a plan must be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the institution’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an "undercapitalized" bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is "significantly undercapitalized." "Significantly undercapitalized" banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional measures, including, but not limited to, a required sale of sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, a requirement to reduce total assets, cessation of taking deposits from correspondent banks, the dismissal of directors or officers and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. "Critically undercapitalized" institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status. These actions are in addition to other discretionary supervisory or enforcement actions that the OCC may take.

Dividend and Other Capital Distribution Limitations. Federal regulations impose various restrictions or requirements on the ability of savings institutions to make capital distributions, including cash dividends. A savings institution that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as Kearny Bank, must file notice with the Federal Reserve Board and an application or a notice with the OCC at least thirty days before making a capital distribution, such as paying a dividend to Kearny-Federal. A savings institution must file an application with the OCC for prior approval of a capital distribution if: (i) it is not eligible for expedited treatment under the applications processing rules; (ii) the total amount of all capital distributions, including the proposed capital distribution, for the applicable calendar year would exceed an amount equal to the savings institution’s net income for that year to date plus the institution’s retained net income for the preceding two years; (iii) it would not adequately be capitalized after the capital distribution; or (iv) the distribution would violate an agreement with the OCC or applicable regulations. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove a notice and the OCC may disapprove a notice or deny an application for a capital distribution if: (i) the savings institution would be undercapitalized following the capital distribution; (ii) the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or (iii) the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation, enforcement action or agreement or condition imposed in connection with an application. 

Qualified Thrift Lender Test. Federal savings institutions must meet a qualified thrift lender test or they become subject to the business activity restrictions and branching rules applicable to national banks. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act made failure to satisfy the qualified thrift lender test potentially subject to enforcement action as a violation of law. To meet the qualified thrift lender requirement, a savings institution must either (i) be deemed a "domestic building and loan association" under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code") by maintaining at least 60% of its total assets in specified types of assets, including cash, certain government securities, loans secured by and other assets related to residential real property, educational loans and investments in premises of the institution or (ii) satisfy the statutory qualified thrift lender test set forth in the Home Owners’ Loan Act by maintaining at least 65% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments (defined to generally include residential mortgages and related equity investments, certain mortgage-related securities, small business loans, student loans and credit card loans). For purposes of the statutory qualified thrift lender test, portfolio assets are defined as total assets minus goodwill and other intangible assets, the value of property used by the institution in conducting its business and specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets. A savings institution must maintain its status as a qualified thrift lender in at least nine out of every twelve months. 

A savings institution that fails the qualified thrift lender test and does not convert to a bank charter will generally be prohibited from: (1) engaging in any new activity not permissible for a national bank; (2) paying dividends not permissible under national bank regulations; and (3) establishing any new branch office in a location not permissible for a national bank in the institution’s home state. Its holding company would become regulated as a bank holding company rather than a savings and loan holding company. In addition, if the institution does not requalify under the qualified thrift lender test within three years after failing the test, the institution would be prohibited from making any investment or engaging in any activity not permissible for a national bank.

Transactions with Related Parties. Transactions between a savings institution (and, generally, its subsidiaries) and its related parties or affiliates are limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of an institution is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the institution. In a holding company context, the parent holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the institution. Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act limits the extent to which the institution or its subsidiaries may engage in "covered transactions" with any one affiliate to 10% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus. The term "covered transaction" includes an extension of credit, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit and similar transactions. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with specified requirements. The law also requires that affiliate transactions be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution, as those provided to non-affiliates. 

Kearny Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things and subject to certain exceptions, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders:

- 

be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and 

- 

not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Kearny Bank’s capital. 

In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Kearny Bank’s board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved.

Community Reinvestment Act. Under the CRA, every insured depository institution, including Kearny Bank, has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA requires the OCC to assess the depository institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to consider such record in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, such as a merger or the establishment of a branch office by Kearny Bank. The OCC may use an unsatisfactory CRA examination rating as the basis for the denial of an application. Kearny Bank received a "satisfactory" CRA rating in its most recent CRA examination. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System. Kearny Bank is a member of the FHLB of New York, which is one of twelve regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from funds deposited by financial institutions and proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans to members pursuant to policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the FHLB. 

As a member, Kearny Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of New York in specified amounts. The FHLB imposes various limitations on advances such as limiting the amount of certain types of real estate related collateral and limiting total advances to a member.

The FHLB of New York may pay periodic dividends to members. These dividends are affected by factors such as the FHLB’s operating results and statutory responsibilities that may be imposed such as providing certain funding for affordable housing and interest subsidies on advances targeted for low- and moderate-income housing projects. The payment of such dividends or any particular amount cannot be assumed.

Other Laws and Regulations 

Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Kearny Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Kearny Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws (and their implementing regulations) applicable to credit transactions, such as the:

- 

Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 

- 

Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring that borrowers for mortgage loans for one- to four-family residential real estate receive various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender servicing and escrow account practices, and prohibiting certain practices that increase the cost of settlement services; 

- 

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 

- 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 

- 

Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; 

- 

Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and 

- 

Truth in Savings Act, prescribing disclosure and advertising requirements with respect to deposit accounts. 

The operations of Kearny Bank also are subject to the:

- 

Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 

- 

Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, governing automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; 

- 

Check Clearing for the 21 st Century Act (also known as "Check 21"), which gives "substitute checks," such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; 

- 

USA PATRIOT Act, which requires institutions operating to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; and 

- 

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to "opt out" of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties. 

Regulation of Kearny Financial

General. Kearny Financial is a savings and loan holding company within the meaning of Section 10 of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, it is required to file reports with, and is be subject to regulation and examination by, the Federal Reserve Board. Kearny Financial must also obtain regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve Board before engaging in certain transactions, such as mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Kearny Financial and any non&#8209;savings institution subsidiaries. This permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to pose a serious risk to Kearny Bank. This regulation is intended primarily for the protection of the depositors and not for the benefit of stockholders of Kearny Financial. 

The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that, to the greatest extent possible taking into account any unique characteristics of savings and loan holding companies and the requirements of the Home Owners’ Loan Act, it intends to apply to savings and loan holding companies its supervisory approach to the supervision of bank holding companies. The stated objective of the Federal Reserve Board is to ensure the savings and loan holding company and its non-depository subsidiaries are effectively supervised, can serve as a source of strength for, and do not threaten the safety and soundness of, the subsidiary depository institutions.

Activities Restrictions. As a savings and loan holding company, Kearny Financial is subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions on its business activities. The non-banking activities of Kearny Financial and its non-savings institution subsidiaries is restricted to certain activities specified by the Federal Reserve Board regulation, which include performing services for and holding properties used by a savings institution subsidiary, activities authorized for savings and loan holding companies as of March 5, 1987 and non-banking activities permissible for bank holding companies pursuant to Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 or authorized for financial holding companies pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Before engaging in any non-banking activity or acquiring a company engaged in any such activities, Kearny Financial must file with the Federal Reserve Board either a prior notice or (in the case of non-banking activities permissible for bank holding companies) an application regarding its planned activity or acquisition. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a savings and loan holding company may only engage in activities authorized for financial holding companies if they meet all of the criteria to qualify as a financial holding company. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve Board will require savings and loan holding companies to elect to be treated as financial holding companies in order to engage in financial holding company activities. In order to make such an election, the savings and loan holding company and its depository institution subsidiaries must be well capitalized and well managed. 

Mergers and Acquisitions. Kearny Financial must obtain approval from the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting stock of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company or acquiring such an institution or holding company by merger, consolidation, or purchase of its assets. Federal law also prohibits a savings and loan holding company from acquiring more than 5% of a company engaged in activities other than those authorized for savings and loan holding companies by federal law or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the FDIC. In evaluating an application for Kearny Financial to acquire control of a savings institution, the Federal Reserve Board would consider factors such as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of Kearny Financial and the target institution, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds, the convenience and the needs of the community and competitive factors. 

Consolidated Capital Requirements. Savings and loan holding companies have historically not been subjected to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for bank and savings and loan holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to their subsidiary depository institutions. Instruments such as cumulative preferred stock and trust-preferred securities, which were previously includable as Tier 1 capital by bank holding companies, within certain limits, are no longer includable as Tier 1 capital, subject to certain grandfathering. The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implemented the Dodd-Frank Act’s directives as to holding company capital requirements. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary depository institutions applied to savings and loan holding companies as of January 1, 2015. As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer is being phased in between 2016 and 2019. 

Source of Strength Doctrine. The Dodd-Frank Act also extended the "source of strength" doctrine, which has long applied to bank holding companies, to savings and loan holding companies as well. The Federal Reserve Board has promulgated regulations implementing the "source of strength" policy, which requires holding companies to act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial distress. Further, the Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies that it has also applied to savings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for consultation with a holding company’s Federal Reserve Bank as to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary depository institution becomes undercapitalized. In addition, a subsidiary savings institution of a savings and loan holding company must file prior notice with the Federal Reserve Board, and receive its nonobjection, as well as filing an application or notice with the OCC, and receive OCC approval or nonobjection, before paying dividends to the parent savings and loan holding company. Federal Reserve Board guidance also provides for regulatory review of certain stock redemption and repurchase proposals by holding companies. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Kearny Financial to pay dividends, engage in stock redemptions or repurchases or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 

Acquisition of Control. Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire "control" of a savings and loan holding company. An acquisition of "control" can occur upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting stock of a savings and loan holding company or as otherwise defined by the Federal Reserve Board. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the anti&#8209;trust effects of the acquisition. Any company that so acquires control is then subject to regulation as a savings and loan holding company.
