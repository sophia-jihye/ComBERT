 Item 1. 

Business 

ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that is developing immune-based therapies for the treatment of cancers. Immunotherapy is an emerging approach to treating cancer in which a patient&#8217;s own immune system is stimulated to target tumor antigens, which are molecular signals that the immune system uses to identify foreign bodies. While some other cancer immunotherapies only target a single cancer antigen, our technology can elicit an immune response against several antigens. Our cancer immunotherapies are also distinguished by the fact that they target cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are the primary drivers of tumor growth and disease recurrence. Our most advanced product candidate, ICT-107, recently began phase 3 testing in which we anticipate randomizing 414 patients in about 120 clinical sites in the U.S., Canada and Europe. In addition, we have a portfolio of other potential therapeutic immunotherapies using our proprietary approach to treating cancer. 

ICT-107, our lead product candidate, is a dendritic cell (DC) vaccine for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and lethal type of brain cancer. ICT-107 is designed to activate a patient&#8217;s immune system to target six different tumor-associated antigens. ICT-107 has completed phase 2 testing with results reported in December 2013. Additional updated results were reported in June 2014 and November 2014. In November 2015, overall survival (OS) was additionally updated and reported. The phase 2 clinical trial was designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled (2:1 randomized), multicenter evaluation of the safety and efficacy of ICT-107 in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. From January 2011 until September 2012, the trial enrolled 278 patients at 25 centers throughout the U.S. and 124 patients were randomized to ICT-107 or placebo. As reported in November 2015, ICT-107 treated patients had a numerical advantage in OS of 1.6 months more than placebo patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population but the difference in survival between ICT-107 and placebo treated patients (the primary efficacy endpoint of the trial), did not reach statistical significance (p-value = 0.44; Hazard Ratio = 0.85). For Progression-Free Survival (PFS), an important secondary efficacy endpoint, the most updated results were reported in November 2014 when ICT-107 treated patients had a 1.3 month advantage in median PFS compared with placebo patients in the ITT population. This difference in PFS between ICT-107 and placebo treated patients reached statistical significance (p-value = 0.03; Hazard Ratio = 0.64). ICT-107 was generally well tolerated, with no imbalance in adverse events between the treated and placebo groups. 

The ICT-107 treatment effect appears to be strongest in the pre-defined subgroup of HLA-A2 patients. We analyzed HLA-A2 patients according to their methylation (MGMT) gene status (unmethylated or methylated) which is a known predictor of responsiveness to standard of care chemotherapy. While the subgroups we analyzed were small in size, and not powered to show statistical significance, the numeric advantages in favor of the ICT-107 treated patients were shown to be large and clinically meaningful. Median OS for the HLA-A2 methylated MGMT per protocol (PP) population was 37.7 months for the ICT-107 patients and 23.9 months for the control group, representing a 13.8 month median OS numeric benefit for the ICT-107 treated group while not achieving statistical significance (p-value = 0.65; Hazard ratio = 0.80). Median OS for the HLA-A2 unmethylated MGMT PP population was 15.8 months for ICT-107 patients and 11.8 months for the control group, representing a 4 month median OS numeric benefit for the ICT-107 treated group while not achieving statistical significance (p-value = 0.33; Hazard Ratio = 0.70). 

We decided to pursue phase 3 testing of ICT-107 in HLA-A2 patients on the basis of the updated phase 2 ICT-107 trial data, post-phase 2 discussions with U.S. and European regulators and consultation with GBM key opinion leaders. The phase 3 design was submitted to the U.S. FDA and received Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) in August 2015. Patient screening began in November 2015 in the U.S. We anticipate that it will take 25 months from initial enrollment to randomize a target of 414 patients and that the trial overall will require 4-5 years from initial enrollment to complete and report results. There are currently two interim analyses to be conducted by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). The first is a futility assessment that will occur when 33% of the required trial events have occurred. We estimate that the triggering condition for this assessment will occur roughly 2 years into the trial. The second is an efficacy assessment that will occur when 60% of the required trial events have occurred. We estimate that the triggering condition for this assessment will occur roughly 2.5 years into the trial. The trial is being conducted in the U.S., Canada, and Europe and we are working with the major cancer cooperative groups in each region to ensure sufficient and timely access to qualifying patients. 

In addition to ICT-107, we are also developing two other therapeutic DC vaccines: ICT-140 for ovarian cancer and ICT-121 for recurrent GBM. ICT-140 targets seven tumor-associated antigens expressed on ovarian cancer cells. Some of the antigens utilized in ICT-140 were also used in ICT-107. We filed an investigational new drug (IND) application for ICT-140 at 

the end of 2012 and the IND was allowed by the FDA in January 2013. We subsequently twice modified the design of the trial and amended the IND to reflect these changes in May 2013 and September 2014. These amendments were allowed by the FDA shortly after the submissions. During the interim time period, we upgraded our generalized DC vaccine manufacturing process to bring it to a phase 3 and commercial ready state. We plan to use this improved process to manufacture clinical supplies for the ICT-140 trial. We are holding the initiation of this trial until we can find a partner to share expenses or until we have secured sufficient financial resources to complete the ICT-107 phase 3 program. ICT-121 specifically targets CD133, a CSC marker that is overexpressed in a wide variety of solid tumors, including ovarian, pancreatic, and breast cancers. We began screening patients in September 2013 for a single-site phase 1 trial in recurrent GBM. Originally it was our intention to enroll 20 patients at one site. However, during 2014, we determined that enrollment would occur faster if additional sites were added to the study. In 2015 we added five sites and made modifications in the screening criteria to facilitate enrollment. We anticipate the trial will be fully enrolled by the end of 2016. 

In September 2014, we entered into a licensing agreement with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) for exclusive rights to novel technology for the development of stem cell immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. The technology originated from the labs of David Baltimore, Ph.D., Nobel Laureate and President Emeritus at Caltech, and utilizes the patient&#8217;s own hematopoietic stem cells to create antigen-specific killer T cells to treat cancer. We plan to utilize this technology to expand and complement our dendritic cell-based cancer vaccine platform, with the goal of developing new immunotherapies that kill cancer cells in a highly directed and specific manner and that can function as monotherapies or in combination therapy approaches. 

Caltech&#8217;s technology potentially addresses the challenge, and limitation, that TCR (T cell receptor) technologies have faced of generating a limited immune response and having an unknown persistence in the patient&#8217;s body. We believe that by inserting DNA that encodes T cell receptors into stem cells rather than into T cells, the immune response can be transformed into a durable and more potent response that could effectively treat previously resilient solid cancers. This observation has been verified in animal models by investigators at Caltech and the National Cancer Institute. 

The first step in the research program for this Stem-to-T-Cell technology is to identify the genetic sequence of a TCR which will become the basis for the product development program. In November 2015, we entered into a sponsored research agreement with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center with the goal of identifying a TCR sequence. In addition, in 2015 we acquired an option from Stanford University to evaluate certain technology related to the identification of TCRs that could prove useful in supporting our Stem-to-T-Cell research efforts. 

Autologous cell-based therapies must be manufactured separately for each patient. As a consequence, the manufacturing costs are typically higher when compared to other types of therapies that are not patient specific. We have developed our DC vaccine manufacturing process so that we can make multiple doses of a patient&#8217;s vaccine from a single manufacturing run utilizing one apheresis from the patient. In addition, the vaccine is stored in liquid nitrogen making the logistics of shipping and administration to the patient easier than that for other cell therapies that must be shipped fresh and administered to the patient within hours of manufacture. 

While we believe that we have a promising technology portfolio of multiple clinical-stage candidates, we do not currently anticipate that we will generate any revenues from either product sales or licensing in the foreseeable future. We have financed the majority of our prior operations through the sales of securities and believe that we may access grants and awards to supplement future sales of securities. On September 18, 2015, the Company received an award in the amount of $19,919,449 from the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) to partially fund the Company&#8217;s Phase 3 trial of ICT-107. The award provides for a $4,000,000 project initial payment, which was received during the fourth quarter of 2015, and up to $15,919,449 in future milestone payments that are primarily dependent on patient enrollment in the ICT-107 Phase 3 trial. Under the terms of the CIRM award, the Company is obligated to share future ICT-107 related revenue with CIRM. The percentage of revenue sharing is dependent on the amount of the award received by the Company and whether the revenue is from product sales or license fees. The maximum revenue sharing amount the Company may be required to pay to CIRM is equal to nine (9) times the total amount awarded and received by the Company. The Company has the option to decline any and all amounts awarded by CIRM. As an alternative to revenue sharing, the Company has the option to convert the award to a loan, which such option the Company must exercise on or before ten (10) business days after the FDA notifies the Company that it has accepted the Company&#8217;s application for marketing authorization. In the event the Company exercises its right to convert the award to a loan, it will be obligated to repay the loan within ten (10) business days of making such election, including interest at the rate of the three-month LIBOR rate (0.61% as of December 31, 2015) plus 25% per annum. 

The estimated cost of completing the development of any of the current or potential immunotherapy candidates will require us to raise additional capital, generate additional capital from the uncertain exercise of outstanding warrants, or enter into collaboration agreements with third parties. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain any additional 

funding, or if such funding is available, that the terms will be favorable. In addition, collaborations with third parties may not be available to us and may require us to surrender rights to many of our products, which may reduce the potential share of returns in any licensed products. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital or secure collaborations with third parties, we will not be able to further develop our product candidates.

Pre-clinical 

Cancer is caused by abnormal cells that grow in an uncontrolled manner. These cells proliferate and can metastasize throughout the body causing tumors that can result in organ failure and death. Unfortunately, conventional cancer treatments, such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, have limited therapeutic benefit and significant undesirable side effects. Our approach is to develop cancer therapies that activate the body&#8217;s immune system response to fight cancer. FDA-approved cancer immunotherapies, such as sipuleucel-T and ipilimumab, have been shown to improve patient survival where conventional therapies failed. 

We believe our approach of targeting multiple tumor-associated antigens, as well as CSC antigens, will enable us to develop clinically effective treatments. Cancer is a complex disease often characterized by several cellular abnormalities. We believe that targeting multiple cancer antigens not only increases the likelihood of an effective treatment, but can also prevent tumor escape mechanisms that are sometimes observed with single-antigen targeted therapies. 

Solid tumors commonly consist of different types of cancer cells. CSCs are a subset of cancerous cells representing a small number of all cells in a tumor. They are believed to be responsible for growth and recurrence of primary and metastatic tumors. Like normal stem cells, CSCs have the ability to self-renew and make differentiated daughter cells. But, unlike normal stem cells, CSCs no longer have the ability to regulate their own growth. Scientists have shown that CSCs are resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. Thus, conventional therapies can eliminate most of the bulk tumor, but since the CSCs are not destroyed, the tumor can regrow after treatment. Complete eradication of the entire tumor mass requires elimination of the CSCs. 

Active Immunotherapy 

DCs are cells responsible for antigen processing and presentation to the immune system and play a central role in the body&#8217;s immune response. They act as first responders that initiate a T cell response to fight infections or foreign bodies. DCs do this by recognizing, processing and presenting foreign antigens to the T cells. Thus, they are powerful potentiators of acquired immunity through an effective presentation of the cancer antigens to T cells, which subsequently mediate the killing of cancer cells. The goal of DC-based vaccines is to (i) make use of and enhance the DC&#8217;s ability to trigger a T cell response and (ii) stimulate DCs to focus the T cell response to specifically target and destroy cancer cells. 

DCs normally do not target malignant tumors, since they do not recognize the tumor as a foreign body that needs to be eliminated. Also, they are typically not present in sufficient numbers to permit an adequately potent immune response to fight cancer. DC therapy typically involves harvesting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a patient, culturing them and processing them in a laboratory to produce a sufficient number of highly potent DCs. The DCs are then cultured with tumor-associated antigens and injected back into the patient, where they can signal T cells to seek out and destroy cancer cells that express the tumor-associated antigens. 

Sipuleucel-T was the first cell-based cancer immunotherapy to be approved by the FDA. The prostate cancer vaccine utilizes the patient&#8217;s antigen presenting cells (APCs) to target a single tumor antigen known as prostatic acid phosphatase. A randomized phase 3 trial showed that sipuleucel-T was safe and extended the median overall survival of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients by four months. 

We believe that manufacturing and logistical costs associated with sipuleucel-T have limited the drug&#8217;s commercial viability. Manufacturing is relatively inefficient as only about 25% of the final product actually consists of APCs. The APCs cannot be stored and must be administered within 18 hours. Also, patients must undergo three apheresis procedures every two weeks to harvest enough cells to manufacture three doses of sipuleucel-T. 

In contrast, our DC technology avoids many of sipuleucel-T&#8217;s shortcomings. As much as 90% of our final manufacturing product is DCs, which, we believe, can stimulate a much stronger immune response than APCs. Our manufacturing process is typically able to produce about 20 doses from a single apheresis procedure. The DCs can be frozen and stored for long periods. Our phase 2 ICT-107 vaccines have already demonstrated stability beyond two years. Freezing the vaccine eliminates the need to ship the product back to patients within 18 hours. Also, DCs can be administered more conveniently by intradermal injection versus intravenous infusion for sipuleucel-T. 

Product Candidates 

ICT-107 

The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that about 23,770 malignant tumors of the brain and spinal cord were diagnosed in the U.S. in 2015. GBM is the most prevalent and aggressive form of brain cancer. Over 10,000 new patients are diagnosed with GBM in the U.S. each year. Despite advances in surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, recurrence is almost a certainty, occurring on average within 6.9 months. The median survival time for newly diagnosed GBM patients is only 14.6 months, and fewer than 10% of these patients live more than five years. 

ICT-107 is a DC vaccine that targets six different tumor-associated antigens that are found on patients&#8217; tumor cells; at least four of the six antigens are highly expressed on CSCs. The therapeutic vaccine is intended to be used subsequent to conventional therapy or concomitantly with chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. Results from a phase 1 clinical trial at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles showed that ICT-107 was well tolerated, with no significant adverse events reported. Of the 16 newly diagnosed patients treated with ICT-107, seven continue to survive beyond six years. Six of the 16 patients were disease free over five years. One of these six patients later died from leukemia without recurrence of GBM, one progressed at 62 months, and four patients are still free of disease. The median PFS in the 16 newly diagnosed patients enrolled in the trial was 16.9 months, and median OS was 38.4 months&#8212;the latter representing a 20 month advantage as compared to historical standard of care in similar patients. 

In June 2010, ICT-107 for the treatment of glioblastoma or brain stem glioma was granted Orphan Drug status by the FDA, making the product candidate eligible, under certain circumstances, for marketing exclusivity and other potential benefits. 

In September 2010, we entered into a Master Services Agreement (MSA) with Aptiv Solutions (formerly Averion International Corp.), a clinical research organization. Under the MSA, Aptiv Solutions provides us with clinical trial support 

services in connection with and over the course of our phase 2 clinical trial for ICT-107, including overseeing enrollment of patients and execution. The MSA, which may be terminated by us at any time, provides for a limit of approximately $5.0 million on the fees that we will be obligated to pay if all of the planned services are actually provided. 

In January 2011, we entered into a vaccine production agreement with the University of Pennsylvania, who assisted us in the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) production of ICT-107 for the phase 2 trial. In October 2011, we entered into an agreement with Progenitor Cell Therapy, LLC to serve as a second manufacturer of ICT-107 for the phase 2 trial. 

In February 2014, ICT-107 for the treatment of glioma, which includes glioblastoma multiforme, was granted Orphan Drug status by the EMA, providing us with eligibility to incentives, under certain circumstances, including a ten-year period of market exclusivity, access to a centralized review process, trial design assistance and scientific advice during product development, fee reductions, and tax incentives. 

In March 2015, we entered into a vaccine production agreement with PharmaCell B.V. to serve as the European manufacturer of ICT-107 for the phase 3 trial. 

In June 2015, we entered into a vaccine production agreement with PCT, LLC, a Caladrius Company, a subsidiary of Caladrius Biosciences, Inc. to serve as the North American manufacturer of ICT-107 for the phase 3 trial. 

In June 2015, we entered into a MSA with Novella Clinical LLC, a clinical research organization. Under the MSA, Novella provides us with clinical trial support services in connection with and over the course of our phase 3 clinical trial for ICT-107, including overseeing enrollment of patients and execution. The MSA, which may be terminated by us at any time, provides for a limit of approximately $40.0 million on the fees that we will be obligated to pay if all of the planned services are actually provided. 

In August 2015, the ICT-107 phase 3 trial design, that was submitted earlier to the U.S. FDA, received Special Protocol Assessment (SPA). 

ICT-140 

The ACS estimates that in the U.S. about 22,280 women will receive a new diagnosis of ovarian cancer and about 14,240 will die from ovarian cancer in 2016. The National Cancer Institute reports that ovarian cancer is the ninth leading cause of cancer death in the United States and the lifetime risk is approximately 1.4%. By contrast according to the most recent estimates 39% of women who inherit a harmful BRCA1 mutation and 11% to 17% of women who inherit a harmful BRCA2 mutation will develop ovarian cancer by age 70. 

Ovarian cancer usually spreads via local shedding into the peritoneal cavity followed by implantation on the peritoneum and via local invasion of bowel and bladder. The incidence of positive nodes at primary surgery has been reported to be as much as 24% in patients with stage I disease, 50% in patients with stage II disease, 74% in patients with stage III disease and 73% in patients with stage IV disease. The five-year survival rate for all stages of ovarian cancer is approximately 44%. For cases where a diagnosis is made early in the disease, when the cancer is still confined to the primary site, the five-year survival rate is 92%. However, only 15% of all ovarian cancers are found at this early stage. 

Many ovarian cancers are spontaneously invaded by T cells, and patients whose tumors have tumor-infiltrating T cells survive longer. As a result, we believe that cancer immunotherapies may improve the survival rate of patients with ovarian cancer. 

ICT-140 is a DC vaccine that targets seven tumor-associated antigens expressed on ovarian cancer cells. Some of the antigens utilized in ICT-140 are also used in ICT-107. We filed an investigational new drug (IND) application for ICT-140 at the end of 2012 and the IND was allowed by the FDA in January 2013. We subsequently twice modified the design of the trial and amended the IND to reflect these changes in May 2013 and September 2014. These amendments were allowed by the FDA shortly after the submissions. During the interim time period, we upgraded our generalized DC vaccine manufacturing process to bring it to the level of phase 3 and commercial ready. We plan to use this improved process to manufacture clinical supplies for the ICT-140 trial. We are holding the initiation of this trial until we have secured a partner and/or sufficient financial resources to complete the ICT-107 phase 3 program. 

ICT-121 

The Company and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center have discovered antigen peptides that can elicit a T cell immune response against CD133, a marker that is commonly present on CSCs. CD133-positive CSCs have been identified in a number of different cancers, including gliomas, colon cancer and pancreatic cancer. 

ICT-121 specifically targets CD133, a CSC marker that is overexpressed in a wide variety of solid tumors, including ovarian, pancreatic, and breast cancers. We began screening patients in September 2013 for a phase 1 trial in recurrent GBM. Originally it was our intention to enroll 20 patients at one site. However, during 2014, we determined that enrollment would occur faster if additional sites were added to the study. In 2015 we added five sites and made modifications in the screening criteria to facilitate enrollment. We anticipate the trial will be fully enrolled by the end of 2016. 

Intellectual Property Agreements 

Cedars-Sinai Agreements 

In November 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Cedars-Sinai (the Original License Agreement). As an upfront licensing fee, we issued Cedars-Sinai 694,000 &#32;shares of common stock and paid Cedars-Sinai $62,000 . Subsequently, we issued Cedars-Sinai an additional 100,000 &#32;shares of our common stock as an additional license fee. 

On May 13, 2015, we entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement (the Amended License Agreement) with Cedars-Sinai to amend and restate the terms of the Original License Agreement. 

Pursuant to the Amended License Agreement, we acquired an exclusive, worldwide license from Cedars-Sinai to certain patent rights and technology developed in the course of research performed at Cedars-Sinai into the diagnosis of diseases and disorders in humans and the prevention and treatment of disorders in humans utilizing cellular therapies, including dendritic cell-based vaccines for brain tumors and other cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Under the Amended License Agreement, we will have exclusive rights to, among other things, develop, use, manufacture, sell and grant sublicenses to the licensed technology. 

We have agreed to pay Cedars-Sinai specified milestone payments related to the development and commercialization of ICT-107, ICT-121 and ICT-140. Among other milestone payments, we will be required to pay to Cedars-Sinai specified milestone payments upon commencement of the first Phase 3 clinical trial for our first product and upon first commercial sale of our first product. If both of these milestones are met, the required milestone payments will total $1.1 million . We will pay Cedars-Sinai single digit percentages of gross revenues from the sales of products and high-single digit to low-double digit percentages of our sublicensing income based on the licensed technology. 

The Amended License Agreement will terminate on a country-by-country basis on the expiration date of the last-to-expire licensed patent right in each such country. Either party may terminate the Amended License Agreement in the event of the other party&#8217;s material breach of its obligations under the Agreement if such breach remains uncured 60 days after such party&#8217;s receipt of written notice of such breach. Cedars-Sinai may also terminate the Amended License Agreement upon 30 days&#8217; written notice to us that a required payment by us to Cedars-Sinai under the Amended License Agreement is delinquent. 

We have also entered into various sponsored research agreements with Cedars-Sinai and has paid an aggregate of approximately $1.2 million . The last agreement concluded on March 19, 2014 at an incremental cost of $126,237 . As of December 31, 2015, Cedars-Sinai is not performing any research activities on behalf of the Company. 

The Johns Hopkins University Licensing Agreement 

In February 2012, we entered into a license agreement with The Johns Hopkins University (JHU), pursuant to which we received an exclusive, worldwide license to JHU&#8217;s rights in and to certain technology related to mesothelin-specific cancer immunotherapies. The license covers the application of this technology for all mesothelin peptide-based vaccines for cancer treatment and prevention, except bacteria-based, viral vector-based and nucleic acid-based vaccines. Unless earlier terminated, the term of the license extends in each country until the later of the expiration of the last patent related to the licensed technology in that country or ten years after the effective date of the license agreement. In order to maintain our license rights under the license agreement, we are required to meet certain diligence milestones and timelines. 

Pursuant to the license agreement, we paid an upfront licensing fee in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars, payable half in cash and half in shares of common stock. We are obligated to pay milestone license fees upon completion of specified 

milestones totaling single digit millions of dollars if all milestones are met, customary royalties based on a low single digit percentage of net sales and sublicensing payments shared at a low double digit percentage, as well as annual minimum royalties increasing over time and ranging from low tens of thousands to low hundreds of thousands of dollars. We will also be responsible for reimbursing JHU for reasonable costs associated with the preparation, filing, maintenance and prosecution of the technology subject to the license. In September 2013, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the license agreement that updated certain milestones. In August 2015, we entered into a Second Amendment to Exclusive License Agreement that amended certain sections of the license agreement and further updated certain milestones. 

California Institute of Technology 

On September 9, 2014, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) under which we acquired exclusive rights to novel technology for the development of certain stem cell treatments that are potentially capable of producing antigen specific T cell killing of cancer cells. 

Pursuant to the License Agreement, we agreed to pay a one-time license fee, a minimum annual royalty based on a low single digit percentage of net revenues and an annual maintenance fee in the low tens of thousands of dollars. In addition, we have agreed to make certain milestone payments upon completion of specified milestones. 

Competition 

The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and significant technological advancements. Many companies, research institutions, and universities are conducting research and development in a number of areas similar to those that we focus on. The development of new products could compete with and be superior to our product candidates. 

Many of the companies with which we compete have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and other resources. A number of these companies may have or may develop technologies for products that could be superior to ours. We expect technological developments in the biopharmaceutical and related fields to occur at a rapid rate, and believe competition will intensify as these fields advance. Accordingly, we will be required to devote substantial resources and efforts to research and development activities in order to potentially achieve and maintain a competitive position. Products that we develop may become obsolete before we are able to market them or to recover all or any portion of our research and development expenses. We may be competing with companies that have significantly more experience in undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials with new or improved therapeutic products and obtaining regulatory approvals of such products. A number of these companies already market and may be in advanced phases of clinical testing of various drugs that may compete with our product candidates or any future product candidates that we may develop. Competitors may develop or commercialize products more rapidly than we do, or that have significant advantages over products we develop. Therefore, our competitors may be more successful in commercializing their products, which could adversely affect our competitive position and business. 

In addition to sipuleucel-T and ipilimumab, which have been approved for sale by the FDA, several major biopharmaceutical companies, including Genentech, Inc. (a member of the Roche Group), Amgen Inc., Merck &#38; Co., Inc., Novartis AG, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Celgene Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, smaller biotechnology companies, such as Oncothyreon Inc., Galena Biopharma, Inc., Agenus Inc., Bavarian Nordic A/S, Kite Pharma, Inc., Juno Therapeutics, Inc. and Immunovaccine Inc., are developing cancer immunotherapies. A number of immunotherapy companies, including Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc., Prima Biomed Ltd and DC Prime B.V., also utilize DCs for their therapeutic cancer vaccines. 

In addition to the previously mentioned companies developing cancer immunotherapies, there are also several pharmaceutical companies, including OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Verastem, Inc., Stemline Therapeutics, Inc. and Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc., that are pursuing drugs that target CSCs. Stemline is currently developing a peptide treatment, SL-701, for brain cancer. 

In addition, in October 2015 Novocure received regulatory approval to market its Optune&#8482; device in the U.S. for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The device delivers low-intensity, intermediate frequency, alternating electric currents to the brain. The adoption of this device could impact the speed of the ICT-107 phase 3 enrollment and its potential market should ICT-107 ultimately receive regulatory approval. 

Colleges, universities, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are becoming more active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect royalties for use of technologies that they have developed, some of which may directly compete with our product candidates or any future product candidates that we may 

develop. Governments of a number of foreign countries are aggressively investing in cellular therapy research and promoting such research by public and private institutions within those countries. Domestic and foreign institutions and governmental agencies, along with pharmaceutical and specialized biotechnology companies, can be expected to compete with us in recruiting qualified scientific personnel. 

Our competitive position will be significantly impacted by the following factors, among others: 

&#8226; 

our ability to obtain FDA marketing approval for our product candidates on a timely basis; 

&#8226; 

the level of acceptance of our products by physicians, compared to those of competing products or therapies; 

&#8226; 

our ability to have our products manufactured on a commercial scale; 

&#8226; 

the effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts on behalf of our products; 

&#8226; 

our ability to meet demand for our products; 

&#8226; 

our ability to secure insurance reimbursement for our products; 

&#8226; 

the price of our products relative to competing products or therapies; 

&#8226; 

our ability to recruit and retain appropriate management and scientific personnel; and 

&#8226; 

our ability to develop a commercial-scale research and development, manufacturing and marketing infrastructure, either on our own or with one or more future strategic partners. 

Intellectual Property 

As discussed further below, as of December 31, 2015 , we had rights to or owned a portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications that include claims that cover, or would cover if issued, antigen compositions of our dendritic cell vaccines, methods of use associated therewith, other related technologies, and stem cell technology. 

In 2006, we licensed cancer vaccine technology from the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. To date, three U.S. patents have issued, possessing expiration dates ranging from about 2024 to 2031, covering our ICT-107 product candidate, and related patent protection is pending in the U.S. and Canada. Three U.S. patents have also issued covering our cancer vaccine product candidate ICT-121, and these patents possess expiration dates of about 2028 to 2030; corresponding patent protection is pending or has issued in several foreign jurisdictions. For our ICT-140 product candidate, patent applications are pending in the U.S. and several foreign jurisdictions; any patents to issue from these applications will have an expiration date of about 2034. One or more of the U.S. patents and foreign applications, should they issue, may be entitled to an increased term due to, for example, patent term extension or additional proprietary protection through a supplementary protection certificate. 

There can be no assurance that any further patents will issue in the U.S. or in any foreign jurisdiction relating to our ICT-107, ICT-121, or ICT-140 product candidates, or that any patent that has issued, or does issue in the future, will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others. 

In addition to the proprietary rights drawn to dendritic cell-based vaccine product candidates that we have secured from Cedars-Sinai, we have licensed rights to issued patents and pending patent applications relating to various antigens used in the vaccine products. There can be no assurance that any further patents will issue in the U.S. or in any foreign jurisdiction relating to these antigens, or that any patent that has issued, or does issue in the future, will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others. 

Dr. John Yu, a co-inventor of our cellular-based therapy technology who serves on our Board of Directors, is employed by Cedars-Sinai, which may assert that future intellectual property generated by Dr. Yu belongs to that institution rather than to us, and we may be required to seek a license from Cedars-Sinai for any such rights. 

Employees 

As of March 23, 2016 , we have six &#32;full-time employees and four &#32;part-time employees. In addition, we have a number of consulting agreements for clinical development, regulatory affairs, investor relations and business development. We outsource 

all of our drug discovery research, process development, manufacturing and clinical development to third parties with expertise in those areas. 

Government Regulation 

The United States and other developed countries extensively regulate the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution of drugs and biologic products. The FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations, regulates pharmaceutical and biologic products. 

To obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data supporting safety and efficacy for the intended indication as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate. In most cases, this will require extensive laboratory tests and preclinical and clinical trials. The collection of these data, as well as the preparation of applications for review by the FDA involve significant time and expense. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing to monitor the safety and efficacy of approved products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the therapeutic claims and commercial applications of these products. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals if we fail to comply with regulatory standards or if we encounter problems at any time following initial marketing of our products. 

The first stage of the FDA approval process for a new biologic or drug involves completion of preclinical studies and the submission of the results of these studies to the FDA. This data, together with proposed clinical protocols, manufacturing information, analytical data and other information submitted to the FDA, in an investigational new drug application (IND), must become effective before human clinical trials may commence. Preclinical studies generally involve FDA regulated laboratory evaluation of product characteristics and animal studies to assess the efficacy and safety of the product candidate. 

After the IND becomes effective, a company may commence human clinical trials. However, the FDA may place the IND on clinical hold at any time, which requires that issues concerning safety of the product or trial be resolved to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction prior to resuming activities under the IND. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase 1 trials consist of testing of the product candidate in a small number of patients or healthy volunteers, primarily for safety at one or more doses. Phase 1 trials in cancer are often conducted with patients who are not healthy and who have end-stage or metastatic cancer. Phase 2 trials, in addition to safety, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate in a patient population somewhat larger than phase 1 trials. Phase 3 trials typically involve additional testing for safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at multiple test sites. A company must submit to the FDA a clinical protocol, accompanied by the approval of the Institutional Review Boards at the institutions participating in the trials, prior to commencement of each clinical trial. 

To obtain FDA marketing authorization, a company must submit to the FDA the results of the preclinical and clinical testing, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate, in the form of a new drug application (NDA) or, in the case of a biologic, like dendritic cell-based vaccines for neurological disorders, a biologics license application (BLA). The FDA has sixty days after the sponsor&#8217;s submission of an NDA or BLA to file the application and begin the user fee review period. Unless an exemption applies, each BLA we submit will be required to be accompanied by a substantial user fee payment. 

The amount of time taken by the FDA for approval of an NDA or BLA will depend upon a number of factors, including whether the product candidate qualifies for priority review, the quality of the submission and studies presented, the potential contribution that the compound will make in improving the treatment of the disease in question, and the workload at the FDA. The FDA has committed to reviewing standard BLAs in 10 months from filing and priority BLAs in six months from filing, but the actual time it takes to review any BLA that we may file could be substantially longer. 

The FDA may, during its review of an NDA or BLA, ask for additional test data that may require the conduct of additional clinical trials. If the FDA does ultimately approve the product candidate for marketing, it may require post-marketing testing to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the product. The FDA also may in some circumstances impose restrictions on the use of the product, such as a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, which may be difficult and expensive to administer and may require prior approval of promotional materials. 

We will also be subject to a variety of regulations governing clinical trials and sales of our products outside the United States. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product candidate by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries and regions must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from one regulatory authority to another and the time may be longer or shorter than that 

required for FDA approval. In the European Union, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar, in principle, to those in the United States. 

Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facilities are in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s cGMP, which are regulations that govern the manufacture, holding and distribution of a product. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with the FDA&#8217;s general biological product standards. Following approval, the FDA periodically inspects drug and biologic manufacturing facilities to ensure continued compliance with the good manufacturing practices regulations. We must ensure that any third-party manufacturers continue to comply with those requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing or recall or seizure of product. Adverse patient experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or market removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval. 

The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of a drug or biologic product also must be in compliance with FDA and Federal Trade Commission, requirements, which include, among others, standards and regulations for off-label promotion, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet, and direct-to-consumer advertising. We also will be subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. In addition, we will be subject to various laws and regulations governing laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of product approvals, seize or recall products, and deny or withdraw approvals. 

We also will be subject to federal regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency and to regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state regulatory statutes, and may in the future be subject to other federal, state or local regulations. 

We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys&#8217; fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Orphan Drug Act 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 

If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. 

A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
