Our Company 

&#160; 

References to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our company&#8221; refer to Farmland Partners, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, including Farmland Partners Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;), of which we are the sole member of the sole general partner. 

&#160; 

We are an internally managed real estate company incorporated in Maryland that owns and seeks to acquire high-quality farmland located in agricultural markets throughout North America. As of the date of this Annual Report, the majority of the acres in our portfolio are used to grow primary crops, such as corn, soybeans, wheat, rice and cotton, while some of our farms produce specialty crops, such as blueberries, vegetables and edible beans. However, over the long term, we expect that our farmland portfolio will be comprised of approximately 80% primary crop farmland and 20% specialty crop farmland, which we believe will give investors exposure to the increasing global food demand trend in the face of growing scarcity of high quality farmland and will reflect the approximate breakdown of U.S. agricultural output between primary crops and animal protein (whose production relies principally on primary crops as feed), on one hand, and specialty crops, on the other. In addition, in August 2015, the Company announced the launch of the FPI Loan Program, an agricultural lending product aimed at farmers, as a complement to the Company's primary business of acquiring and owning farmland and leasing it to farmers. Under the FPI Loan Program, we intend to make loans to third-party farmers (both tenant and non-tenant) to provide partial financing for working capital requirements and operational farming activities, farming infrastructure projects, and for other farming and agricultural real estate related purposes. 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in Maryland on September 27, 2013, and we are the sole member of the general partner of the Operating Partnership, which is a Delaware limited partnership that was formed on September 27, 2013. All of our assets are held by, and our operations are primarily conducted through, the Operating Partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries. As of the date of this Annual Report we own 63.8% of the common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership (&#8220;OP units&#8221;) and none of the preferred units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership (&#8220;Preferred Units&#8221;). See Note 9 to our combined consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Preferred Units. 

&#160; 

As of the date of this Annual Report, we owned 253 farms with approximately 99,572 total acres and eight grain storage facilities. The distribution of farms by state is as follows:

&#160;

We intend to continue to acquire additional farmland to achieve scale in and further diversify our portfolio by geography and crop type. During 2015, we continued our geographic diversification with acquisitions in four new states, and began our diversification into specialty crops with the acquisition of a blueberry farm. Also during 2015, we entered into lease options on three of our farms for solar and wind production and commenced the FPI Loan Program whereby we make loans secured by mortgages on farmland. We also may acquire, and make loans secured by mortgages on, properties related to farming, such as grain storage facilities, grain elevators, feedlots, processing plants and distribution centers, as well as livestock farms or ranches. In addition, we engage directly in farming through FPI Agribusiness Inc., our taxable REIT subsidiary (the &#8220;TRS&#8221; or &#8220;FPI Agribusiness&#8221;), whereby we operate a small number acres (approximately 563 acres as of December 31, 2015) relying on custom farming contracts with local farm operators. 

&#160; 

Our principal source of revenue is rent from tenants that conduct farming operations on our farmland. The majority of the leases that are in place as of the date of this Annual Report have fixed annual rental payments. Some of our leases have variable rents based on the revenue generated by our farm-operator tenants. We believe that this mix of fixed and variable rents will help insulate us from the variability of farming operations and reduce our credit-risk exposure to farm-operator tenants, while making us an attractive landlord in certain regions where variable leases are customary. However, we may be exposed to tenant credit risk and farming operation risks, particularly with respect to leases that do not require advance payment of 100% of the annual rent, leases for which the rent is based on a percentage of a tenant's farming revenues and leases with terms greater than one year. 

&#160; 

We elected and qualified to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our short taxable year ended December 31, 2014. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

We believe the following competitive strengths distinguish us from many of our competitors: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

High-Quality Portfolio of Farmland. As of the date of this Annual Report, we owned 253 farms generally well located near large navigable river and railway systems and in agricultural markets that we believe are characterized by high demand for and limited available supply of farmland. Crops produced on our farms address the vast majority of the spectrum of worldwide demand for food, feed, fuel and fiber. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Management Team with Extensive Experience in Agricultural Real Estate. Mr. Pittman and the other members of our management team have extensive experience as owners of agricultural real estate and operators of farming businesses. As a result of this extensive experience, we believe we have a deeper understanding of agribusiness fundamentals and greater insight into factors affecting the value of farmland than many institutional owners and acquirers of farmland, which we believe is advantageous in, among other activities, structuring acquisitions and tenant leases. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expansive Relationships in the Agricultural Sector. Mr. Pittman&#8217;s and the other members of our management team&#8217;s extensive experience as owners of agricultural real estate and operators of farming businesses has helped us build expansive and strong relationships across a broad network of businesses and individuals in the agricultural sector, including family and corporate farms, real estate brokers, lenders, auction houses and suppliers of agricultural goods. We believe that these relationships provide us with valuable market intelligence related to agriculture fundamentals and provide us access to acquisition opportunities, many of which may not be available to our competitors. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Early-Mover Advantage as a Leading Owner of Farmland. Ownership of U.S. farmland historically has been, and continues to be, extremely fragmented, with the vast majority of farmland being owned by families and individuals. According to the USDA, as of 2012, approximately 87% of farms in the United States were owned by families, and the average age of principal farm operators in the United States was 58 years old. We are one of the first public companies focused on owning and acquiring farmland in the United States. We believe our flexible capital structure, together with our ability as a public company to access the capital markets, will allow us to secure an early-mover advantage to become a large-scale, national owner of high-quality farmland. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Strong Alignment of Interests. As of the date of this Annual Report, our executive officers and our directors collectively own approximately 9% of the equity interests in our company on a fully diluted basis, which we believe aligns their interests with those of our stockholders. 

&#160; 

Our Business and Growth Strategies 

&#160; 

Our principal business objective is to provide attractive stockholder returns through a combination of: (1) quarterly cash distributions to our stockholders; (2) sustainable long-term growth in cash flows from increased rents, which we hope to pass on to stockholders in the form of increased distributions; (3) additional cash flows derived from increased rents in connection with farm improvements (such as irrigation and drainage) and non-farming income streams (such as wind and solar leases); and (4) potential long-term appreciation in the value of our properties due in part to increasing farmland scarcity in the face of growing global food demand. Our primary strategy to achieve our business objective is to invest in, own and lease a portfolio of farmland and properties related to farming operations. Key components of our strategy include the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Focus on Current Rental Income Generation and Long-Term Appreciation. We own and intend to acquire farmland that we believe offers attractive risk-adjusted returns through a combination of stable rental income generation and value appreciation. We expect to continue to lease our farmland to experienced and successful third-party farm operators, including sellers who desire to continue farming the land after we acquire it. We expect our farmland leases to generate stable short-term cash flows and increasing rental income over the long term. In certain circumstances, we look for alternative uses for our farms (such as solar and wind leases) when we believe it will create greater value for our stockholders. We intend to hold our properties for investment with a view to long-term appreciation, which we believe will result in attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders. However, if we believe it to be in the best interests of our stockholders, we may elect to sell one or more of our properties from time to time in a manner consistent with our investment objectives and our intention to qualify as a REIT. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Continue Our Disciplined Farmland Acquisition Strategy Based on Agriculture Fundamentals. We intend to continue to acquire high-quality farmland that we believe is positioned to take advantage of global food supply and demand trends and is located in geographic areas that historically have had a stable population of experienced and successful farm operators. We believe that we benefit from our management&#8217;s and staff&#8217;s extensive experience as owners and operators of agricultural real estate in identifying acquisition opportunities that satisfy our investment criteria and underwriting standards. Our acquisition strategy includes the following key components: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Target Farms of Varying Sizes &#8212;We seek to acquire farms of varying sizes. We believe that our personnel and infrastructure allow us to perform due diligence on smaller farms quickly and efficiently, which provides us with an advantage over competitors that we believe do not have the investment focus or flexibility to pursue acquisitions of smaller farms. In addition, we believe small individual and family farmland buyers often are not as well capitalized as we are and may be unable to compete with us for acquisition opportunities of larger farms comprised of 1,500 or more tillable acres. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Acquire Farmland from Undercapitalized Owners &#8212;While we do not believe there is widespread financial distress among farmland owners, we do believe that, to a limited extent, undercapitalization, overleverage, mismanagement and unforeseen circumstances at some individual and family farms will provide opportunities for us to acquire high-quality farmland at attractive prices, potentially in purchase-leaseback transactions. We believe our management&#8217;s and staff&#8217;s knowledge of agribusiness fundamentals and broad network of relationships allow us to pursue acquisition opportunities from undercapitalized or unsuccessful sellers in markets where we believe we can find experienced and successful farm operators (including, in some cases, the existing owners) to lease the farmland from us at competitive rates and where we believe market fundamentals support future value appreciation potential. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Use OP Units as Acquisition Currency &#8212;We believe there are a large number of farm operators and farm families that own farmland that has substantially appreciated in value. According to the USDA's most recent published data, as of 2012, the average age of principal farm operators in the United States was 58 years old, with 33% age 65 or older, and the average age has been increasing steadily in recent years. As a result, we believe that many farm-owning families have estate planning needs and a desire to defer current income taxes, and that our ability to offer OP units as acquisition currency provides us with a strategic advantage over other potential farm buyers and possibly induce these prospective sellers to sell their farms earlier than they otherwise would in cash-only transactions. Since our inception, we have completed several farm acquisitions, including our two largest acquisitions to date, using OP units as partial consideration. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Utilize Our Real Estate Management Platform to Achieve Economies of Scale. We believe that the overhead costs associated with the business of owning and leasing farmland are less than those required by other property types, such as office, multifamily and retail, due to the limited asset management, capital expenditure and tenant improvement requirements for farmland and a near-zero vacancy rate for quality farmland in quality markets. In addition, the terms of the leases with our tenants generally provide that we are responsible for major maintenance, insurance and taxes (which are generally reimbursed to us by our tenants), while our tenants are responsible for minor maintenance, water usage and all of the additional input costs related to the farming operations on the property, such as seed, fertilizer, labor and fuel. As a result, we believe that our existing systems and personnel are capable of supporting a significant increase in the size of our portfolio without a proportional increase in administrative or management costs. We also believe that, once we achieve scale in our portfolio, we will be able to realize significant cost savings and greater operational efficiency. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Leverage Our Infrastructure to Expand into the Lending Business. We believe that our existing systems and personnel are well suited to source, diligence, close and manage loans under the FPI Loan Program at little or no additional costs. We believe that the business of making loans secured by mortgages on farmland is highly complementary to and synergistic with our core business of investing in farmland. We generally find potential borrowers during the process of sourcing farm acquisitions. We conduct due diligence on loan collateral the same way we conduct due diligence on potential farm acquisitions, and we screen potential borrowers the same way we screen potential tenants. The FPI Loan Program also gives us an increased visibility in the marketplace, thereby benefiting our core farmland investing business. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Further Diversify our Portfolio by Geography and Crop Type. Since our initial public offering, we have significantly increased the diversification of our portfolio by geography, crop type and tenant, and we intend 

&#160;

to further diversify our portfolio going forward, particularly with respect to geography and crop type. We focus on geographic areas with substantial farming infrastructure and low transportation costs, including markets with access to river and rail transportation and with a relatively large and stable population of experienced farm operators as potential tenants. In addition, while we believe that primary crop farmland provides the greatest opportunity for value appreciation and increasing rental income over time, we intend to diversify our portfolio by adding farmland suitable for specialty crops and properties related to farming. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Leverage Economies of Scale in Our Tenants&#8217; Combined Farming Operations. Farm operators typically do not have a scale that gives them bargaining power with many of their suppliers. Conversely, suppliers to farm operators incur significant marketing costs in reaching out to a highly fragmented customer base. We intend to create value for our farm-operator tenants as well as for some of their suppliers by aggregating our tenants&#8217; purchases of certain inputs &#8211; such as seed, fertilizer and equipment &#8211; and offering such aggregated purchases from selected suppliers on discounted terms. We believe that, by performing this role as an aggregator, we will be able to retain some of the value created for the ultimate benefit of our stockholders. 

&#160; 

Our ability to effectively implement our business and growth strategies is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Properties." 

&#160; 

Investment Focus 

&#160; 

We seek to invest in farmland that will give our stockholders exposure to the increasing global food demand trend in the face of farmland scarcity, while offering an attractive risk-adjusted combination of stable rental income generation and value appreciation. Our principal investment focus is on farmland located in agricultural markets throughout North America; however, we may seek to acquire farmland outside of North America in the future. We also may acquire properties related to farming, such as grain storage facilities, grain elevators, feedlots, processing plants and distribution centers, as well as livestock farms or ranches. In addition, under the FPI Loan Program, we provide mortgage loans secured by farmland and properties related to farming. 

&#160; 

Crop Categories 

&#160; 

Farm crops generally can be divided into two principal categories: primary crops and specialty crops. Primary crops include, among others, corn, soybeans, wheat, rice and cotton. Specialty crops can be again divided into two categories: annual specialty crops (generally vegetables) and permanent specialty crops (fruits and nuts grown on trees, bushes or vines). Over the long term, we expect that our farmland portfolio will be comprised of approximately of 80% primary crop farmland and 20% specialty crop farmland, which we believe will give investors exposure to the increasing global food demand trend in the face of growing scarcity of high quality farmland and will reflect the approximate breakdown of U.S. agricultural output between primary crops and animal protein (whose production relies principally on primary crops as feed), on one hand, and specialty crops, on the other. 

&#160; 

Annual vs Permanent Crops 

We primarily seek to buy farms that produce annual crops. We believe that annual crop farmland has less risk than permanent crop farmland because annual crops require less time and capital to plant. If a farm operator loses an annual crop to drought, flooding, fire or disease, the farm operator can generally resume production on the land in a few weeks or months. However, if a farm operator loses a permanent crop, there generally would be significant time and capital needed to return the land to production because a tree or vine may take years to grow before bearing fruit. Annual crop farmland also enables the farm operator to rotate crop types to improve soil quality, react to commodity price trends and adopt improved crop varieties. Permanent crop farmland is dedicated to one crop during the lifespan of the trees or vines and therefore cannot be rotated to adapt to changing conditions. As a result, we invest in permanent crop farmland only if the expected total return is high enough to be attractive on a risk-adjusted basis. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Primary vs Specialty Crops 

&#160; 

We believe, for the following reasons, that primary crop farmland is more likely to appreciate and provide increasing rental income over time than other types of farmland: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Primary crops constitute a large portion of the global d emand for agricultural products and offer the most direct exposure to the fundamentals (population growth, GDP per capita growth and biofuels) that we expect will drive farmland values for the foreseeable future; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Primary crops are easily transported in bulk, can be stored during periods of abundant production and sold during periods of scarcity, and generally are not subject to regional market dynamics; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Primary crop production involves little overhead and is capital intensive, and a large portion of the added value accrues to farmland as its most scarce production factor. 

&#160; 

We believe that specialty crop farmland, especially if planted with permanent crops, is riskier than primary crop farmland and, therefore, we generally seek higher returns for this type of investment and intend to limit our exposure to approximately 20% of the acres in our portfolio. 

&#160; 

U.S. Farmland Property 

&#160; 

We believe that the United States offers farmland investors exposure to financial benefits driven by the fundamentals of agricultural production and farmland appreciation without many of the risks that come with farmland investments in many other countries. In the United States, the farmland market is relatively liquid and there is virtually no land title risk. Moreover, the United States has the largest, lowest-cost grain transportation infrastructure in the world, leaving more margin to the grain producer and landowner. Lastly, we believe that in most major U.S. agricultural markets, multiple quality farm-operator tenants compete for farmland lease opportunities. 

&#160; 

We may consider investing in farmland in other countries that, like the United States, offer virtually no land title risk, a sophisticated farm-operator tenant environment and attractive rental rates, such as Canada, Australia or New Zealand. 

&#160; 

Leased Properties 

&#160; 

Farming land for crops carries significant operating risk, although it can be mitigated through crop insurance and other risk management tools. If a crop fails or the land does not produce the anticipated amount of crops, the farm operator may experience an economic loss. We believe that through leasing farmland, rather than farming it ourselves, we will mitigate this risk significantly. We intend to continue to lease a majority of our properties on a fixed-rent basis that does not depend on the success of the tenant's farming operations. Moreover, a majority of the leases in our portfolio provide that at least 50% (and often 100%) of the annual rent is due and payable in advance of each spring planting season, and we expect that a majority of the fixed-rent leases we enter into in the future will have a similar requirement, which reduces our credit-risk exposure in the event of operational issues with the farm-operator tenant. However, to the extent we enter into leases that do not require advance payment of 100% of the annual rent or have terms greater than one year, we may be subject to tenant credit risk and more susceptible to the risks associated with declines in the profitability of tenants&#8217; farming operations, and we take such risk into consideration when evaluating the potential return on a farm. We may use variable-rent leases, which depend in part on crop yields and prices, in regions where such arrangements are prevalent or when we expect that such arrangements will be more profitable to us on a risk-adjusted basis. We also may utilize hybrid lease arrangements that require a modest rent payment at lease inception and an additional rent payment based on a percentage of the revenue from the tenant's harvest for that year. 

&#160; 

We expect to continue to lease the majority of our farmland and other farming related properties under leases that require the tenant to either pay or reimburse us for substantially all of the property&#8217;s operating expenses, including maintenance, water usage and insurance, as well as all of the input costs related to the farming operations, such as seed, fertilizer, labor and fuel. Several of our leases provide for the reimbursement by the tenant of the property&#8217;s real estate 

&#160;

taxes that we pay in connection with the farms they rent from us. The rental payments we receive from the farm operators will be the primary source of any distributions that we make to our stockholders. 

&#160; 

We expect that over time rental income will increase. Most farmland in the areas where we own or intend to acquire land is leased under short-term leases (typically three years or less), and we plan to lease our property under short-term leases. By entering into short-term leases, we believe we will be in a position to increase our rental rates when the leases expire and are renewed or the land is re-leased, if prevailing rental rates have increased. However, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to increase our rental rates, or even maintain them at the same level, when the leases are renewed or the land is re-leased. 

&#160; 

We believe quality farmland has a near-zero vacancy rate, and we believe that high-quality farmland in an area with a competitive tenant environment is generally leased and farmed each year. For leases that provide that a substantial portion of rental payments for a crop year are due in advance of the spring planting season, in the event of a tenant's failure to pay rent when due, we will seek to terminate the lease and rent the property to another tenant that could then plant and harvest a crop that year. As a result, we believe there is a reduced risk of vacancy on our properties when compared to most other types of commercial properties, such as office buildings or retail properties. 

&#160; 

Tenants 

&#160; 

We believe the areas where we own and intend to acquire farmland are characterized by a competitive farm-operator tenant environment, with multiple experienced farm operators seeking to expand their operations by leasing additional farmland. 

&#160; 

Non-Farming Leases 

&#160; 

In addition to leases entered into in connection with farming operations, we seek additional sources of income from our properties that are either incremental, such as wind easements and recreational leases, or are higher than farming rents, such as leases for solar power installations. While we do not believe that such other sources of income will constitute a significant percentage of our total revenues, they offer opportunities to enhance returns to stockholders at little or no cost to us. 

&#160; 

Family-Owned Properties 

&#160; 

According to the USDA, as of 2012, approximately 87% of farms in the United States were owned by families. We believe that many farm families and individuals may wish to simultaneously sell some of their property and lease it back, continuing their operation of such property under a leasing arrangement. Sellers in these sale-leaseback transactions can use the sale proceeds to repay existing indebtedness, for growth of their farming operations or in other business endeavors. Under some circumstances, these sale-leaseback transactions might be driven by estate planning reasons. We believe that the farmland that we acquire and do not simultaneously lease back to the seller can be leased at attractive rental rates to other independent or corporate farm operators. 

&#160; 

As an alternative to selling their farmland to us in an all-cash transaction, we believe that many farm owners may be interested in selling their farmland to us in exchange for OP units in order to have an equity interest in our company and participate in any appreciation in value of our properties. By making such an exchange, these farm owners would become investors in a more diversified portfolio of agricultural real estate. Under certain circumstances, the exchange of real estate for OP units is a tax-deferred exchange under U.S. federal income tax laws. In addition, because we intend to make cash distributions each quarter, OP unit holders would receive regular quarterly cash distributions. Finally, OP unit holders would have the flexibility to redeem their OP units in the future for cash, or, at our election, shares of our common stock that they could then sell in the public market, thereby allowing these sellers to determine the timing of recognizing taxable gain. Because we expect the issuance of OP units in exchange for farmland generally will be driven by the desires of prospective sellers, we do not know how frequently we will issue OP units in exchange for farmland properties. However, we believe that using OP units as acquisition consideration can be a significant part of our property acquisition strategy. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Other Investments 

&#160; 

In addition to farmland, we also may acquire properties related to farming, such as grain storage facilities, grain elevators, feedlots, processing plants and distribution centers, as well as livestock ranches. We currently own eight grain storage facilities, two in each of Illinois, Colorado and Nebraska and one in each of Arkansas and South Carolina. In addition, through the FPI Loan Program, we provide mortgage loans secured by farmland and properties related to farming. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Underwriting Criteria and Due Diligence Process 

&#160; 

Selecting the Property 

&#160; 

We seek to acquire farmland that offers an attractive risk-adjusted balance of current returns and appreciation potential. We believe our management team&#8217;s deep understanding of agribusiness fundamentals and insight into factors affecting the value of farmland allow us to identify properties consistent with our investment criteria. We believe the following factors are important in the selection of farmland: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Soil Quality &#8212;Soil quality is a fundamental determinant of farmland productivity and therefore of its value. In considering farmland for purchase, we take soil quality into consideration to determine whether the farmland is attractively priced. In general, we focus on farmland with average or better-than-average soil. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Water Availability &#8212;Availability of water is essential to farming and is a major consideration in determining the value of farmland. With regard to water availability, we seek to purchase three types of properties: &#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Farmland located in areas with sufficient natural precipitation in an average year for the crops expected to be grown. When appropriate, we may improve these properties by installing wells and irrigation equipment; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Farmland with access to water via wells in areas where the underground water supply is regularly replenished annually by natural precipitation or where the irrigation water supply is annually replenished from surface sources; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Farmland with access to water via wells in areas where the water table is dropping year over year, but where the valuation and current return expectations appropriately reflect the expected decline in value as water runs out. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Robust and Competitive Tenant Environment &#8212;We focus primarily on farmland located in areas characterized by a robust and competitive tenant environment, with a relatively large population of experienced farm operators as potential tenants. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Market Access &#8212;Due to the higher costs of road transportation, the location of farmland relative to points of demand (e.g., grain elevators, feedlots and ethanol plants) or access to low-cost transportation (e.g., river ports and rail loading facilities) determines the premium or discount in farm-gate commodity prices compared to the general market prices (also known as &#8220;basis&#8221;), and therefore is one of the factors that impacts its value. We focus on acquiring farmland in areas with substantial farming infrastructure and low transportation costs, including markets with access to river and rail transportation. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Climate &#8212;We focus our investment activity in regions with favorable climates for growing primary crops, taking into consideration expected crop varietal availability and climate trends. 

&#160; 

We perform a due diligence review with respect to each potential property acquisition. The due diligence investigation includes both property-specific factors (e.g., soil types and fertility, water availability and rights, topographical characteristics and property taxes) and location-specific factors (e.g., climate, tenant availability and quality , and market access). As part of our due diligence process, we also perform a valuation of each target property and estimate expected lease rates. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Selecting Tenants 

&#160; 

We intend to continue to focus primarily on farmland located in areas with a robust and competitive environment of experienced tenants. In general, the tenant selection process focuses primarily on candidates' experience and reputation based upon background and reference checks of potential tenants, as well as their willingness and ability to pay competitive rental rates. We consider similar factors in analyzing sale-leaseback transactions. In geographic areas where we already own one or more properties, we may give our existing local tenants priority consideration, especially in exchange for sourcing a property acquisition opportunity. We generally mitigate tenant credit risk by requiring a significant portion of a year's rent in advance of each spring planting season whenever possible, by requiring a tenant to adopt crop insurance, and/or by filing liens on growing crops. In addition, we monitor our existing tenants by periodically conducting site visits of the farms and meeting with the tenants to discuss their farming operations and the condition of the farms. However, in some circumstances, we may be exposed to tenant credit risk and may be subject to farming operation risks, such as adverse weather conditions and declines in commodity prices, particularly with respect to leases that do not require advance payment of 100% of the annual rent, variable-rent leases for which the rent is based on a percentage of a tenant's farming revenues and leases with terms greater than one year. See "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Properties&#8221;. We do not intend to continuously monitor and evaluate tenant credit quality and may be subject to risks associated with our tenants' financial condition and liquidity position. 

&#160; 

FPI Loan Program 

&#160; 

We believe that our existing systems and personnel are well suited to source, diligence, close and manage loans under the FPI Loan Program at little or no additional cost to us. We believe that the business of making loans secured by mortgages on farmland is highly complementary to, and synergistic with, our core business of investing in farmland. We generally find potential borrowers during the process of sourcing farm acquisitions. We conduct due diligence on loan collateral the same way we conduct due diligence on potential farm acquisitions, and we screen potential borrowers the same way we screen potential tenants. The FPI Loan Program offering gives us an increased visibility in the marketplace, thereby benefiting our core farmland investing business. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Because the leases for a majority of the properties in our portfolio require payment of at least 50% of the annual rent in advance of each spring planting season, we receive a significant portion of our cash rental payments in the first calendar quarter of each year, although we recognize rental revenue from these leases on a pro rata basis over the non-cancellable term of the lease in accordance with GAAP. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Tax Status 

&#160; 

We elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our short taxable year ended December 31, 2014. Our qualification as a REIT will depend upon our ability to meet, on a continuing 

&#160;

basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our capital stock. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and that our intended manner of operation will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

&#160; 

As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Under the Code, REITs are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that they distribute on an annual basis at least 90% of their REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates, and we would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT. Even if we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to state and local taxes on our income and assets and to U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. Additionally, any income earned by FPI Agribusiness Inc., our taxable REIT subsidiary, and any other taxable REIT subsidiaries (&#8220;TRSs&#8221;) that we form or acquire in the future will be fully subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income tax. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

Under the terms and conditions of the leases on our current properties, tenants are generally required, at their expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies and to name us an additional insured party. These policies include liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage arising out of the ownership, use, occupancy or maintenance of the properties and all of their appurtenant areas. In addition to our tenants' insurance policies under which we will be an additional insured party, we also maintain comprehensive liability and casualty insurance covering all of our properties under a blanket insurance policy, which provides coverage to the extent there is insufficient coverage under our tenants' policies. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

Farming Regulation 

&#160; 

The farmland that we own and intend to acquire is used for growing crops and is subject to the laws, ordinances and regulations of state, local and federal governments, including laws, ordinances and regulations involving land use and usage, water rights, treatment methods, disturbance, the environment and eminent domain. 

&#160; 

Farmland is principally subject to environmental and agricultural laws, ordinances and regulations. Each governmental jurisdiction has its own distinct laws, ordinances and regulations governing the use of farmland. Many such laws, ordinances and regulations seek to regulate water usage and water runoff because water can be in limited supply, as is the case where certain of the properties in our portfolio are located. 

&#160; 

All of the farms in our portfolio have sources of water, including expected precipitation, wells and/or surface water, that currently provide sufficient amounts of water necessary for the current farming operations at each location. However, should the need arise for additional water from wells and/or surface water sources, such permits and approvals may be difficult to obtain in areas with limited supply of available water. We believe that as of the date of this Annual Report our farms are in compliance with applicable state, county and federal environmental and agricultural regulations. 

&#160; 

In addition to the regulation of water usage and water runoff, state, local and federal governments also seek to regulate the type, quantity and method of use of chemicals and materials for growing crops, including fertilizers, pesticides and nutrient rich materials. Such regulations could include restricting or preventing the use of such chemicals and materials near residential housing or near water sources. Further, some regulations have strictly forbidden or significantly limited the use of certain chemicals and materials. 

&#160; 

&#160;

As an owner of farmland, we may be liable or responsible for the actions or inactions of our tenants with respect to these laws, regulations and ordinances. 

&#160; 

Real Estate Industry Regulation 

&#160; 

Generally, the ownership and operation of real properties is subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to zoning, land use, water rights, wastewater, storm water runoff and lien sale rights and procedures. These laws, ordinances or regulations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation Liability Act, or CERCLA, and its state analogs, or any changes to any such laws, ordinances or regulations, could result in or increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing, or created by tenants or others, on our properties. Laws related to upkeep, safety and taxation requirements may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, loss of our properties or other impairments to operations, any of which would adversely affect our cash flows from operating activities. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

As an owner of real estate, we will be subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our properties. Environmental laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of the contaminants. The costs of any required investigation or cleanup of these substances could be substantial. The liability is generally not limited under such laws and could exceed the property&#8217;s value and the aggregate assets of the liable party. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties also may expose us to third-party liability for personal injury or property damage or adversely affect our ability to lease the real property or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. These and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Competition to our efforts to acquire farmland can come from many different entities. Individual farmers are the most active buyers of farmland. Institutional investors, investment funds, other farmland REITs, individual investors and others also compete for farmland acreage. Investment firms that we might compete directly against could include agricultural investment firms such as Westchester Agriculture Asset Management (a TIAA-CREF company), Hancock Agricultural Investment Group, Prudential Agricultural Investments, and UBS Agrivest, LLC. These firms engage in the acquisition, asset management, valuation and disposition of farmland properties. REITs that we might compete with are Gladstone Land Corp. and American Farmland Company.
