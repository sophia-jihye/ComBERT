 Item 1. Business. &#160;

Overview 

&#160;

We are a medical device company focusing on the development and commercialization of our proprietary MicroNet&#8482; stent platform technology for the treatment of complex vascular and coronary disease. A stent is an expandable &#8220;scaffold-like&#8221; device, usually constructed of a metallic material, that is inserted into an artery to expand the inside passage and improve blood flow. Our MicroNet, a micron mesh sleeve, is wrapped over a stent to provide embolic protection in stenting procedures.

&#160;

Our CGuard&#8482; carotid embolic prevention system (&#8220;CGuard EPS&#8221;) combines our MicroNet mesh and a self-expandable nitinol stent in a single device for use in carotid artery applications. Our CGuard EPS received CE mark approval in the European Union in March 2013, and we launched its release on a limited basis in October 2014. In January 2015, a new version of CGuard, with a rapid exchange delivery system, received CE mark approval in Europe and in September 2015, we announced the full market launch of the CGuard EPS in Europe through a distribution agreement with Penumbra, Inc. In September 2015, we also received regulatory approval to commercialize the CGuard EPS in Argentina and Columbia.

&#160;

Our MGuard&#8482; coronary product, MGuard Prime Embolic Protection System (&#8220;MGuard Prime EPS&#8221;), is marketed for use in patients with acute coronary syndromes, notably acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and saphenous vein graft coronary interventions (bypass surgery). We market and sell MGuard Prime EPS, a bare-metal cobalt-chromium based stent, for the treatment of coronary disease in the European Union. MGuard Prime EPS received CE mark approval in the European Union in October 2010 for improving luminal diameter and providing embolic protection. However, as a result of a shift in industry preferences away from bare-metal stents in favor of drug-eluting (drug-coated) stents, in 2014 we decided to curtail further development of this product in order to focus on the development of a drug-eluting stent product. Due to limited resources, though, our efforts to date have been limited to incorporating our MicroNet in-house onto a drug-eluting stent manufactured by a potential partner.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We are also developing a neurovascular flow diverter, which is an endovascular device that directs blood flow away from cerebral aneurysms in order to ultimately seal the aneurysms. Our flow diverter would utilize an open cell, highly flexible metal scaffold to which MicroNet would be attached. We have commenced initial pre-clinical testing of this product in both simulated bench models and standard in vivo pre-clinical models.

&#160;

We also intend to develop a pipeline of other products and additional applications by leveraging our MicroNet technology to new applications to improve peripheral vascular and neurovascular procedures, such as the treatment of the superficial femoral artery disease, vascular disease below the knee and neurovascular stenting to open diseased vessels in the brain.

&#160;

Presently, none of our products may be sold or marketed in the United States.

&#160;

During the first quarter of 2015, we implemented a cost reduction/focused spending plan. The plan has four components: (i) reducing headcount; (ii) limiting the focus of clinical and development expenses to only carotid and neurovascular products; (iii) limiting sales and marketing expenses to those related to the CGuard&#8482; EPS stent launch; and (iv) reducing all other expenses (including conferences, travel, promotional expenses, executive cash salaries, director cash fees, rent, etc.). In addition, we decided to alter our commercial strategy by using third party distributors to drive future sales, as opposed to direct sales to hospitals and clinics, which had previously been our focus.

&#160;

Effective as of October 1, 2015, we amended our certificate of incorporation in order to (i) effectuate a one-for-ten reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock and (ii) reduce the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 125,000,000 to 50,000,000. All share and related option and warrant information presented in this prospectus supplement have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reduced number of shares outstanding which resulted from this action.

&#160;

We were organized in the State of Delaware on February 29, 2008.

&#160;

We make available, free of charge, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports on our website at www.inspiremd.com as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports and other information is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

&#160;

Business Segment and Geographic Areas 

&#160;

Prior to October 2014, all revenue was derived from sales of MGuard Prime EPS, our bare-metal coronary stent. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, 70% of our revenue was derived from sales of this product. For financial information about our one operating and reportable segment and geographic areas, refer to &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 7.

&#160;

Our Industry 

&#160; 

Carotid 

&#160;

Carotid arteries are located on each side of the neck and provide the primary blood supply to the brain. Carotid artery disease, also called carotid artery stenosis, is a type of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) that is one of the major risk factors for ischemic stroke. In carotid artery disease, plaque accumulates in the artery walls, narrowing the artery and disrupting the blood supply to the brain. This disruption in blood supply, together with plaque debris breaking off the artery walls and traveling to the brain, are the primary causes of stroke. According to the World Heart Federation (http://www.world-heart-federation.org/cardiovascular-health/stroke/, l ast visited on Mar. 11, 2016), every year, 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke, and nearly six million die and another five million are left permanently disabled. According to the same source, stroke is the second leading cause of disability, after dementia.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The potential global market value of carotid stents is approximately $500 million, approximately $300 million of which consists of the U.S. market and approximately $200 million of which consists of the rest of the world ( source: JMP Securities 2014 and Cowen 2014) . Carotid artery stenting is a minimally invasive treatment option for carotid artery disease and an alternative to carotid endarterectomy, where a surgeon accesses the blocked carotid artery though an incision in the neck, and then surgically removes the plaque. Endovascular techniques using stents and EPS protect against plaque and debris traveling downstream, blocking off the vessel and disrupting blood flow. We believe that the use of a stent with an embolic protection system should increase the number of patients being treated since it would avoid the need for complex surgery.

&#160;

Coronary 

&#160;

Physicians and patients may select from among a variety of treatments to address coronary artery disease, including pharmaceutical therapy, balloon angioplasty, stenting with bare metal or drug-eluting stents, and coronary artery bypass graft procedures, with the selection often depending upon the stage of the disease.

&#160;

The global market value of coronary products is estimated at $5.9 billion, of which $4.2 billion is for stable angina and $1.7 billion is for acute myocardial infarctions according to Health Research International (June 2011). According to the 2014 MEDTECH OUTLOOK produced in December 2013 by BMO Capital Markets (&#8220;MEDTECH OUTLOOK&#8221;), revenues from the global coronary stent market are predicted to slightly decline, although in volume of stents the market is predicted to continue to grow. We believe the growth in volume is due to the appeal for less invasive percutaneous coronary intervention (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) procedures and advances in technology coupled with the increase in the elderly population, obesity rates and advances in technology.

&#160;

Neurovascular 

&#160;

The neurovascular market focuses on catheter-delivered products used to treat strokes that already happened or unruptured brain aneurysms that could lead to strokes. In the latter case, coils are wound into blood vessel bulges to block blood flow entering the aneurysms to prevent the aneurysms from rupturing. Endovascular treatment of arterial aneurysm has evolved substantially over the past two decades, transitioning from an investigational therapy into routine clinical practice and ultimately emerging as the treatment of choice for many lesions (source: Medtech Ventures 2009, Aneurysm Flow Modulating Device Market). We believe that the market for aneurysm flow modulating devices is still in the embryonic stage with windows of opportunities for early entrance. The global market for the endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms, which currently stands at $980 million, is expected to reach $1.4 billion by 2020, at a compound average annual growth rate of 5% per year ( source: Medtech Ventures, Endovascular Cerebral Aneurysm Repair Market, October 2013 ).

&#160; 

The neurovascular market includes over-the-wire, flow-guided microcatheters, guiding catheters, coil and liquid embolics, neurovascular stents and flow diversion stents. According to iData Research, the market is expected to be driven by the conversion from surgical procedures to endovascular techniques in the treatment of aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations.

&#160; 

Our Products 

&#160; 

Below is a summary of our current products and products under development, and their intended applications.

&#160;

MicroNet 

&#160;

MicroNet is our proprietary circular knitted mesh which wraps around a stent to protect patients from plaque debris flowing downstream upon deployment. MicroNet is made of a single fiber from a biocompatible polymer widely used in medical implantations. The size, or aperture, of the current MicroNet &#8216;pore&#8217; is only 150-180 microns in order to maximize protection against the potentially dangerous plaque and thrombus.

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

CGuard&#8482; &#8211; Carotid Applications 

&#160;

Our CGuard EPS combines our MicroNet mesh and a self-expandable nitinol stent (a stent that expands without balloon dilation pressure or need of an inflation balloon) in a single device for use in carotid artery applications. MicroNet is placed over and attached to an open cell nitinol metal stent platform which is designed to trap debris and emboli that can dislodge from the diseased carotid artery and potentially travel to the brain and cause a stroke. This danger is one of the greatest limitations of carotid artery stenting with conventional carotid stents and stenting methods. The CGuard EPS technology is a highly flexible stent system that conforms to the carotid anatomy.

&#160;

Our CGuard EPS with over-the-wire delivery system received CE mark approval in the European Union in March 2013. In October 2014, we initiated a limited market release of CGuard EPS with over-the-wire delivery system for use in carotid artery applications in Germany, Poland and Italy.

&#160;

In September 2014, we reported the results of the CGuard CARENET ( CAR otid E mbolic protection using micro NET ) trial at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (&#8220;TCT&#8221;) conference in Washington D.C. In the CARENET trial, the CGuard EPS system demonstrated better results over historical data using conventional commercially available carotid stents. In the third quarter of 2015 the results of the CGuard CARENET trial were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. In November 2015, positive twelve month follow-up data from the CGuard CARENET trial was presented at the 42 nd Annual Symposium on Vascular and Endovascular Issues, documenting the benefits of the CGuard MicroNet technology as well as the patency benefits (maintaining the artery open) of the internal and external carotid arteries at twelve months.

&#160;

We believe that our CGuard EPS design provides advantages over existing therapies in treating carotid artery stenosis, such as conventional carotid stenting and surgical endarterectomy, given the superior embolic protection characteristics provided by the MicroNet. We believe the MicroNet will provide acute embolic protection at the time of the procedure, but more importantly, we believe that CGuard EPS will provide post-procedure protection against embolic dislodgement, which can occur up to 48 hours post-procedure. It is in this post-procedure time frame that embolization is the source of post-procedural strokes in the brain. Schofer, et al. (&#8220;Late cerebral embolization after emboli-protected carotid artery stenting assessed by sequential diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging,&#8221; Journal of American College of Cardiology Cardiovascular Interventions , Volume 1, 2008) have shown that the majority of the incidents of embolic showers associated with carotid stenting occur post-procedure.

&#160;

In the first quarter of 2015, we introduced CGuard RX, the new rapid exchange delivery system for CGuard EPS. The rapid exchange delivery system has a guidewire that passes through the delivery system, running through the guiding catheter. It has one port, and thus, can be operated by one operator, while an over-the-wire-delivery system has two lumens and ports and requires two operators to perform the procedure. Our rapid exchange delivery system received CE mark approval in January 2015. We launched our CGuard EPS in Europe with the rapid exchange delivery system in multiple medical specialties that perform carotid artery stenting. These customers include interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, interventional neuroradiologists and interventional radiologists.

&#160;

In September 2015, we announced full market launch of the CGuard EPS by our distribution partner, Penumbra, Inc., in 18 CE marked countries in Europe. In October 2015, we received regulatory approval to commercialize the CGuard EPS in Argentina and Columbia. We are currently preparing materials required to conduct a clinical trial in the United States. Once complete, we plan to request a pre-submission guidance meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

&#160;

MGuard Products&#8211; Coronary Applications 

&#160;

Bare-Metal Stent MGuard Product. Our MGuard Prime EPS coronary product is comprised of MicroNet wrapped around a cobalt-chromium based bare-metal stent. In comparison to a conventional bare-metal stent, we believe our MGuard Prime EPS coronary product with MicroNet mesh provides protection from dangerous embolic showers in patients experiencing ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, the most severe form of a heart attack, referred to as STEMI. Standard stents were not engineered for heart attack patients. Rather, they were designed for treating stable angina patients whose occlusion is different from that of an occlusion in a heart attack patient. In acute heart attack patients, the plaque or thrombus is unstable and often breaks up as the stent is implanted causing downstream blockages in a significant portion of heart attack patients. Our MGuard Prime EPS is integrated with a precisely engineered micro net mesh that is designed to prevent the unstable arterial plaque and thrombus that caused the heart attack blockage from breaking off.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

During the fourth quarter of 2014, due to a shift in industry preferences away from bare-metal stents in favor of drug-eluting (drug-coated) stents, we decided to curtail developing and promoting our bare-metal stent platform and instead focus on the development of a drug-eluting stent product.

&#160;

Drug-Eluting Stent MicroNet Product Candidate. During 2015, we completed the second phase of development work for our MGuard DES&#8482;, pursuant to which we incorporated our MicroNet with a drug-eluting stent manufactured by a prospective partner. We believe that a drug-eluting stent with MicroNet has the potential to improve certain performance metrics over the MGuard Prime EPS and attract a broader portion of the cardiologists in the worldwide stent market who are more accustomed to using drug-eluting stents. However, due to our limited resources we have tabled further development of MGuard DES at this time.

&#160;

NVGuard &#8211; Neurovascular 

&#160; 

We are developing a neurovascular flow diverter, which is an endovascular device that directs blood flow away from cerebral aneurysms to ultimately seal the aneurysms. Flow diversion is a growing market segment within the neurovascular medical device field. Current commercial flow diverters are highly flexible dense metal mesh tubes that go across most types of cerebral aneurysms and divert the blood flow away from the aneurysm with the desired end result of sealing the aneurysm. The challenges with the current flow diverters are that they (i) are difficult to place given the high metal content in the device, which makes it more difficult to move the device through the delivery system due to resistance from the metal, and to subsequently accurately place it, (ii) need to be accurately placed to avoid crossing and blocking other cerebral vessels, which could cause additional damage by cutting off blood flow to sections of the brain, (iii) require chronic use of anti-thrombotic medications due to the amount of metal in the cerebral vasculature, which could cause thrombotic complications, and (iv) do not allow a physician to reaccess the aneurysm if the aneurysm does not seal, in which event the aneurysm may need to be treated with another therapy such as aneurysm coils, due to the tight metal mesh that will not allow other devices to pass through the flow diverter.

&#160;

Our flow diverter prototype will include our MicroNet that has been employed in CGuard EPS and MGuard Prime EPS. MicroNet has already demonstrated the ability to effectively seal aneurysms in both human coronary arteries using the MGuard Prime EPS and aneurysms in the carotid arteries using the CGuard EPS in human clinical situations without the need for additional devices or procedures (coils or a second stent) ( source: Journal of Medical Case Reports http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/4/1/238 ). For our flow diverter, we plan to utilize an open cell, highly flexible metal scaffold to which MicroNet would be attached. We believe our flow diverter could be more accurately delivered due to a lower metal content scaffold than current commercial flow diverters; lower metal content in our flow diverter may reduce the need for long-term anticoagulation; the open cell metal scaffold combined with the MicroNet may allow passage of other devices through the MicroNet mesh without compromising the MicroNet, thus allowing a physician to reaccess the aneurysm, if needed; and our flow diverter should be capable of being delivered through a state-of-the-art microcatheter for accurate placement without constant repositioning. We have tested early flow diverter prototypes in both simulated aneurysm bench models using various MicroNet configurations with varying aperture sizes, as well as in standard in vivo pre-clinical models, in which we observed aneurysm sealing and also wide open side branch vessels across which the device was placed.

&#160;

In addition to our plan to develop our own flow diverter, we are also evaluating the opportunity to partner with a device company that either has an existing flow diverter or is looking for an entry into the market.

Completed Clinical Trials for CGuard EPS - CARENET 

&#160;

The CARENET trial was the first multi-center study of CGuard EPS following the receipt of CE mark of this device in March 2013. The CARENET trial was designed to evaluate feasibility and safety of the CGuard EPS in treatment of carotid lesions in consecutive patients suitable for coronary artery stenting (&#8220;CAS&#8221;) in a multi-operator, real-life setting. The acute, 30 day, magnetic resonance imaging (&#8220;MRI&#8221;), ultrasound and six month clinical event results were presented at the LINC conference in Leipzig, Germany in February, 2015. In the third quarter of 2015, the results of the CGuard CARENET trial were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. In November 2015, positive twelve month follow-up data from the CGuard CARENET trial was presented at the 42nd Annual Symposium on Vascular and Endovascular Issues, documenting the benefits of the CGuard MicroNet technology as well as the patency benefits (maintaining the artery open) of the internal and external carotid arteries at twelve months.

&#160;

MACCE (myocardial infarction (&#8220;MI&#8221;), stroke or death) was 0.0% at 30 days. At six months, there was one case of death, which was not stent or procedure-related, and MACCE was increased to 3.6%. At twelve months there were three cases of death, which were not stent or procedure-related, and MACCE was 11.1%.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; 30 days (n=30) &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 months (n=28) &#160; &#160; 12 months (n=27) 

&#160; MACCE (MI, stroke, death) &#160; &#160; (0) 0.0 % &#160; &#160; (1) 3.6 % &#160; (3) 11.1 % MI &#160; &#160; (0) 0.0 % &#160; &#160; (0) 0.0 % &#160; (0) 0.0 % stroke &#160; &#160; (0) 0.0 % &#160; &#160; (0) 0.0 % &#160; (0) 0.0 % death &#160; &#160; (0) 0.0 % &#160; &#160; (1) 3.6 % &#160; (3) 11.1 % &#160;

CAS carries the risk of cerebral embolization during and following the procedure, leading to life-threatening complications, mainly cerebral ischemic events. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is a sensitive tool used to identify cerebral emboli during CAS by measuring &#8220;lesions&#8221; within the brain which are areas that are ischemic and do not receive oxygenated blood due to cerebral emboli. In the CARENET trial, 37.0% of patients treated with CGuard EPS had new ischemic lesions at 48 hours after the procedure, with an average volume of 0.039 cm 3 . Of these lesions, there was only one that remained at 30 days following the procedure and all others had resolved. Complete details appear in the following table. Where there is a second number shown below after a &#177;,it indicates the rate of error.

&#160;

&#160; 48 hours n=27 &#160; 30 days n=26 Subjects with new Acute Ischemic Lesions (&#8220;AIL&#8221;) 10 &#160; 1 Incidence of new lesions 37.0% &#160; 4.0% Total number new AIL 83 &#160; 1 Avg. number new AIL per patient 3.19 &#177; 10.33 &#160; 0.04 &#177; 0.20 Average lesion volume (cm 3 ) 0.039 &#177; 0.08 &#160; 0.08 &#177; 0.00 Maximum lesion volume (cm 3 ) 0.445 &#160; 0.116 Permanent AIL at 30 days - &#160; 1 &#160;

The healing process of the tissue and in-stent restenosis can be measured by a non-invasive form of ultrasound called duplex ultrasound. This type of ultrasound measures the velocity of the blood that flows within the carotid arteries, which increases exponentially as the lumen of the internal carotid artery narrows and the percent stenosis increases. One of the measurements is called PSV (peak systolic volume) and is known to be highly correlated to the degree of in-stent restenosis; PSV values higher than 300 cm/sec are indicative of &#62;70% stenosis, while PSV values lower than 104 cm/sec are indicative of &#60;30% restenosis and healthy healing. In the CARENET trial, duplex ultrasound measurements done at 30 days, 6 months and 12 months following the stenting procedure all attest to healthy normal healing without restenosis concerns, as the PSV values were 60.96 cm/sec &#177; 22.31, 85.24 cm/sec &#177; 39.56, and 90.22 cm/sec &#177; 37.72 respectively. The internal carotid artery was patent in all patients (100%).

&#160;

&#160;

The conclusions of the CARENET trial were:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; CARENET trial demonstrated safety of the CGuard EPS stent, with 30 day MACCE of 0%. &#160; &#8226; Incidence of new ipsilateral lesions (percent of patients with new lesions on the ipsilateral side (same side where the stent was employed)) at 48 hours was reduced by almost half compared to published data, and volume was reduced almost tenfold. &#160; &#8226; All but one lesion had resolved completely by 30 days. &#160; &#8226; Twelve month ultrasound analysis is indicative of healthy healing without restenosis concern. &#160; &#8226; CGuard EPS offers unique clinical benefits for patients undergoing CAS with unprecedented safety. &#160;

Ongoing Physician-Sponsored Clinical Trials for CGuard &#8212; PARADIGM Study 

&#160;

PARADIGM ( P rospective evaluation of A ll-comer pe R cutaneous c A roti D revascularization I n symptomatic and increased-risk asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, using C G uard&#8482; M esh-covered embolic prevention stent system) is an investigator-led, single center study with the objective of evaluating feasibility and outcome of routine anti-embolic stent system in unselected, consecutive carotid patients (all-comers) referred for carotid revascularization, initiated in 2015.

&#160;

The PARADIGM included evaluation of 71 CGuard EPS procedures in 68 unselected all-comer patients and continues to show favorable angiographic and clinical outcomes in using CGuard EPS in patients with carotid artery disease as follows:

&#160;

&#183; CGuard EPS success and procedure success rate were 100%. &#183; Periprocedural complications were 0% and remained at 0% at 30 days following the procedure. &#183; No major adverse cardiac or neurological events occurred periprocedurally or at 30 days following the procedure, pursuant to operator-independent neurologist and non-invasive cardiologist evaluation. &#160;

Completed Clinical Trials for MGuard Bare-Metal Coronary Stent Plus MicroNet 

&#160;

We have completed eight clinical trials with respect to our MGuard and MGuard Prime EPS coronary stents. The First in Men (FIM) study conducted in Germany from the fourth quarter of 2006 through the second quarter of 2008 focused on patients with occlusion in their stent graft. This group is considered to be in &#8220;high risk&#8221; for complications during and shortly after the procedure due to the substantial risk of occurrence of a thromboembolic event. The study demonstrated MGuard stent&#8217;s safety in this high risk group. This study was followed by the GUARD study in Brazil in 2007 with a similar patient population which reinforced the safety profile of MGuard stents in patients prone to procedural complications. The MAGICAL study was a pilot study in STEMI patients conducted in Poland from 2008 through 2012 which demonstrated safety, measured by MACE rates at 30 days following the stent procedure,as well as efficacy results, measured by the ability of MGuard to reestablish blood flow into the infarcted area of the muscle. Furthermore, we conducted three registries (iMOS, IMR and iMOS Prime) that confirmed the feasibility of MGuard and MGuard Prime EPS for the treatment of STEMI patients and the safety of MGuard and MGuard Prime EPS in the STMEI patient group. Safety was repeatedly demonstrated in these trials and registries by the low mortality rate in the first month after the procedure.

&#160;

In the second calendar quarter of 2011, we began the MGuard for Acute ST Elevation Reperfusion Trial (which we refer to as our &#8220;MASTER I trial&#8221;), a prospective, randomized study, which demonstrated that among patients with acute STEMI undergoing emergency PCI, patients treated with MGuard had superior rates of epicardial coronary flow (blood flow within the vessels that run along the outer surface of the heart) and complete ST-segment resolution compared to those treated with commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. The results of this trial are summarized in greater detail below.

&#160;

Finally, the MASTER II trial, which we initially initiated as part of our efforts to seek approval of our MGuard Prime EPS by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, was discontinued at our election in its current form in light of market conditions moving toward the use of drug-eluting stents over bare-metal stents. Analysis of the patients already enrolled in the MASTER II trial prior to its suspension, however, reconfirmed the MASTER I safety results due to a continued low mortality rate.

&#160; 

MASTER I Trial 

&#160;

In the second calendar quarter of 2011, we began the MASTER I trial, a prospective, randomized study in Europe, South America and Israel to compare the MGuard with commercially-approved bare metal and drug-eluting stents in achieving superior myocardial reperfusion (the restoration of blood flow) in primary angioplasty for the treatment of acute STEMI, the most severe form of heart attack. The MASTER I trial enrolled 433 subjects, 50% of whom were treated with an MGuard stent and 50% of whom were treated with a commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stent. The detailed acute and 30 days results from the trial were presented at the TCT conference on October 24, 2012 and published (Prospective, Randomized, Multicenter Evaluation of a Polyethylene Terephthalate Micronet Mesh&#8211;Covered Stent (MGuard) in ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction, Stone et. Al, JACC , 60; 2012). The results were as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#183; The primary endpoint of post-procedure complete ST-segment resolution (restoration of blood flow to the heart muscle after a heart attack) was statistically significantly improved in patients randomized to the MGuard stent compared to patients receiving a commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stent (57.8% vs. 44.7%). &#160;

&#160; &#183; Patients receiving the MGuard Coronary stent exhibited superior rates of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 3 flow, which evidences normal coronary blood flow that fills the distal coronary bed completely, as compared to patients receiving a commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stent (91.7% vs. 82.9%), with comparable rates of myocardial blush grade 2 or 3 (83.9% vs. 84.7%) and corrected TIMI frame count (cTFC) (17.0 vs. 18.1), all markers of optimal blood flow to the heart. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Angiographic success rates (attainment of &#60;50% final residual stenosis of the target lesion and final TIMI 3 flow) were higher in the MGuard group compared to commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents (91.7% vs 82.4%). &#160;

&#160; &#183; Mortality (0% vs. 1.9%) and major adverse cardiac events (1.8% vs. 2.3%) at 30 days post procedure were not statistically significantly different between patients randomized to the MGuard Coronary stent as opposed to patients randomized to commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. All other major adverse cardiac event components, as well as stent thrombosis, were comparable between the MGuard Coronary and commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. &#160;

The six month results from the MASTER I trial, which were presented at the 2013 EuroPCR Meeting, the official annual meeting of the European Association for Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions, on May 23, 2013 in Paris, France. The results were as follows:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Mortality (0.5% vs. 2.8%) and major adverse cardiac events (5.2% vs. 3.4%) at 6 months post procedure were not statistically significantly different between patients randomized to the MGuard as compared to patients randomized to commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. All other major adverse cardiac event components, as well as stent thrombosis, were comparable between patients treated with MGuard and those treated with commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. &#160;

The twelve month results from the MASTER I trial were presented at the TCT conference on October 29, 2013 and published (Mesh-Covered Embolic Protection Stent Implantation in ST-Segment&#8211;Elevation Myocardial Infarction Final 1-Year Clinical and Angiographic Results From the MGUARD for Acute ST Elevation Reperfusion Trial, Dudek e. el, Coronary Interventions , 2014. The results were as follows:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Mortality (1.0% vs. 3.3%) and major adverse cardiac events (9.1% vs. 3.3%) at 12 months post procedure were not statistically significantly different between patients randomized to the MGuard stent as opposed to those randomized to commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. All other major adverse cardiac events, as well as stent thrombosis, were comparable between the MGuard stent and commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. &#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In summary, the MASTER I trial demonstrated that among patients with acute STEMI undergoing emergency PCI patients treated with MGuard had superior rates of epicardial coronary flow (blood flow within the vessels that run along the outer surface of the heart) and complete ST-segment resolution compared to those treated with commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. In addition, patients treated with MGuard showed a slightly lower mortality rate and a slightly higher major adverse cardiac event rate as compared to patients treated with commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents six and twelve months post procedure.

&#160;

A detailed table with the results from the MASTER I trial is set forth below. The &#8220;p-Value&#8221; refers to the probability of obtaining a given test result. Any p value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant.

Future Clinical Trials for CGuard EPS and MGuard Prime EPS 

&#160;

Post-marketing clinical trials (outside the United States) could be conducted to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of the CGuard EPS in specific indications. These trials would be designed to facilitate market acceptance and expand the use of the product. We should be able to rely upon CE mark approval of the product and other supporting clinical data to obtain local approvals.

&#160;

We do not anticipate conducting additional post-marketing clinical trials for our bare-metal MGuard coronary products.

&#160;

Growth Strategy 

&#160;

Our primary business objective is to utilize our proprietary technology to become the industry standard for treatment of complex vascular and coronary disease and to provide a superior solution to the common acute problems caused by current stenting procedures, such as restenosis, embolic showers and late thrombosis. We are pursuing the following business strategies in order to achieve this objective.

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Grow our presence in existing and new markets for CGuard EPS. We have fully launched CGuard EPS in most European and Latin American countries, through a combination of distributor sales organizations as well as a partnership with Penumbra, Inc., a global interventional therapies company focused on the neuro and peripheral vascular specialties, to distribute CGuard EPS in Europe in 18 CE marked countries. We are also pursuing additional registrations and contracts in other countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Continue to leverage MicroNet technology to develop additional applications for interventional cardiologists and vascular surgeons. In addition to the applications described above, we believe that we will eventually be able to utilize our proprietary technology to address imminent market needs for new product innovations to significantly improve patients&#8217; care. We continue to broadly develop and protect intellectual property using our mesh technology. Examples of some areas include peripheral vascular disease, neurovascular disease, renal artery disease, and bifurcation disease. &#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; We work closely with leading physicians to evaluate and ensure the efficacy and safety of our products. Some of these prominent physicians serve on our Scientific Advisory Board, which is our advisory committee that advises our board of directors and advises and participates in the operation of our clinical trials. These physicians have and will continue to generate and publish scientific data on the use of our products, and to present their findings at various key clinical conferences. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Establish relationships with collaborative and development partners to fully develop and market our existing and future products. We are seeking strategic partners for collaborative research, development, marketing, distribution, or other agreements, which could assist with our development and commercialization efforts for CGuard EPS and our NVGuard flow diverter, as well as future efforts with MGuard Prime EPS, MGuard DES, and other potential products that are based on our MicroNet technology. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Continue to protect and expand our portfolio of patents. Our MicroNet technology and the use of patents to protect it are critical to our success. We own numerous patents for our MicroNet technology. Twelve separate patent applications have been filed in the United States some of which have corresponding patent applications and/or issued patents in Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, and South Africa. We believe these patents and patent applications collectively cover all of our existing products, and may be useful for protecting our future technology developments. We intend to aggressively continue patenting new technology, and to actively pursue any infringement covered by any of our patents. We believe that our patents, and patent applications once allowed, are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and maximizing our return on research and development investments. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Resume development and successfully commercialize the next generation of drug-eluting stent incorporating MicroNet. While we have limited the focus of product development to carotid and neurovascular products, if we resume development of our coronary products, we plan to evaluate opportunities to further develop a drug-eluting stent that incorporates MicroNet. &#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, subject to change and impacted by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants.

&#160;

Carotid 

&#160;

The carotid stent markets in the United States and Europe are dominated by Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific Corporation, Covidien Ltd. (currently part of Medtronic, Inc.), and Cordis Corporation. Gore Medical and Terumo Medical Corporation produce mesh-covered carotid stents. All of these larger companies have substantially greater capital resources, larger customer bases, broader product lines, larger sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs and larger facilities than ours and have established reputations and relationships with our target customers, as well as worldwide distribution channels that are more effective than ours. However, we believe that the European market is somewhat fragmented, and, in our opinion, smaller competitors may be able to gain market share with greater flexibility.

&#160; 

Coronary 

&#160;

The bare-metal stent and the drug-eluting stent markets in the United States and Europe are dominated by Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific Corporation, and Medtronic, Inc. In the future, we believe that physicians will look to next-generation stent technology to compete with existing therapies. These new technologies will likely include bio-absorbable stents, stents that focus on treating bifurcated lesions, and stents with superior polymer and drug coatings, and many industry participants are working to improve stenting procedures in the future as the portfolio of available stent technologies rapidly increases.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

According to the MEDTECH OUTLOOK, the three major players (Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific Corporation and Medtronic, Inc.) in the worldwide coronary stent market have a combined total market share of approximately 92%. To date, our sales are not significant enough to register in market share. As such, one of the challenges we face to further our product growth is the competition from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the therapeutics area, as well as competition from academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. Most of our current and potential competitors, including but not limited to those listed above, have, and will continue to have, substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, regulatory and clinical, manufacturing, marketing and sales, distribution and personnel resources than we do. Due to ongoing consolidation in the industry, there are high barriers to entry for small manufacturers in both the European and the United States markets.

&#160;

Neurovascular 

&#160;

Stryker Corporation dominated the global interventional neurology market in 2014. The other key players in this market include Medtronic plc, Johnson &#38; Johnson, Terumo Corporation, Penumbra, Inc., Abbott Laboratories, Merit Medical Systems, Inc., W. L. Gore &#38; Associates, Inc., Microport Scientific Corporation, and Medikit Co., Ltd., among others. ( source: Markets and Markets 2015). 

&#160;

Research and Development Expenses 

&#160;

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we spent $3.6 million and $8.7 million, respectively, on research and development.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

In October 2007, the MGuard coronary stent system with a bio-stable MicroNet received CE mark approval in the European Union. Currently, we are actively selling our MGuard coronary stent system with a bio-stable MicroNet through local distributors in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia.

&#160;

Based on the positive CGuard EPS clinical data, we commercially launched CGuard EPS in CE marked countries in early 2015. We initially sold CGuard products through a distributor network as we did with MGuard coronary products. On August 5, 2015, InspireMD, Ltd., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a distribution agreement with Penumbra, Inc., and, in September 2015, we announced full market launch of the CGuard EPS by Penumbra, Inc. in 17 CE marked countries in Europe.

&#160;

We plan to focus our marketing efforts primarily on Europe, Asia and Latin America. In addition to utilizing local and regional distributor networks, we are using international trade shows and industry conferences to gain market exposure and brand recognition. We plan to work with leading physicians to enhance our marketing efforts.

&#160;

Product Positioning &#160; 

&#160;

The MGuard coronary stent system has initially penetrated the market by entering segments with indications that present high risks of embolic dislodgement, notably acute MI and saphenous vein graft coronary interventions. Even though MGuard technology has demonstrated its advantages with clinical data, it is based on a bare-metal platform while the market demand has shifted away from bare-metal stents in favor of drug-eluting stents.

&#160;

When treating carotid artery disease, we believe that there is an opportunity to enter the market with bare-metal stent platform and to become a competitive player without a drug-eluting stent platform. Therefore, we believe that CGuard EPS is poised for commercial growth in 2016 as more and more positive clinical data is presented. Finally, we do not expect that it would be crucial to use a drug-eluting stent platform to compete in certain new markets such as the neurovascular market, and hence, we plan to continue to explore this area of opportunity.

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Insurance Reimbursement 

&#160;

In most countries, a significant portion of a patient&#8217;s medical expenses is covered by third-party payers. Third-party payers can include both government funded insurance programs and private insurance programs. While each payer develops and maintains its own coverage and reimbursement policies, the vast majority of payers have similarly established policies. All of the MGuard and CGuard products sold to date have been designed and labeled in such a way as to facilitate the utilization of existing reimbursement codes, and we intend to continue to design and label our present and future products in a manner consistent with this goal.

&#160;

While most countries have established reimbursement codes for stenting procedures, certain countries may require additional clinical data before recognizing coverage and reimbursement for the MGuard and CGuard products or in order to obtain a higher reimbursement price. In these situations, we intend to complete the required clinical studies to obtain reimbursement approval in countries where it makes economic sense to do so.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Patents 

&#160; 

We have filed sixteen patent applications, twelve of which are pending in the United States covering aspects of our MGuard and CGuard technology. We have filed corresponding patent applications to some of these in Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India and South Africa, for an aggregate total of 46 patents and pending applications including four issued U.S. patents. These patent rights are directed to cover percutaneous therapy, knitted stent jackets, stent and filter assemblies, in vivo filter assembly, optimized stent jackets, stent apparatuses for treatment via body lumens and methods of use, stent apparatuses for treatment via body lumens and methods of manufacture and use, among others. In lay terms, these patent applications generally cover three aspects of our products: the mesh sleeve with and without a drug, the product and the delivery mechanism of the stent. On October 27, 2010, our South African patent application pertaining to &#8220;Stent Apparatus for Treatment via Body Lumens and Method of Use&#8221; was issued as South African Patent No. 2007/10751. On October 25, 2011, our patent application pertaining to &#8220;In Vivo Filter Assembly,&#8221; U.S. Patent Application 11/582,354, was issued as U.S. Patent 8,043,323. On June 13, 2012, our patent application pertaining to &#8220;Filter Assemblies,&#8221; Chinese Patent Application No. 200780046659.9, was issued as Chinese Patent No. ZL200780046659.9. On September 26, 2012, our patent application pertaining to &#8220;Bifurcated Stent Assemblies,&#8221; Chinese Patent Application No. 200780046676.2, was issued as Chinese Patent No. ZL200780046676.2. On October 10, 2012, our patent application pertaining to &#8220;Knitted Stent Jackets,&#8221; Chinese Patent Application No. 200780046697.4, was issued as Chinese Patent No. ZL200780046697.4. On January 2, 2013, our patent application pertaining to &#8220;Optimized Stent Jacket,&#8221; Chinese Patent Application No. 200780043259.2, was issued as Chinese Patent No. ZL200780043259.2. We have also had Israeli Patent No. 198189 entitled &#8220;Filter Assemblies&#8221; issued March 27, 2014, and Patent No. 198190, entitled &#8220;Knitted Stent Jackets&#8221; issued Feb. 1, 2014, and Canadian Patent No. 2609687 entitled &#8220;Stent Apparatuses For Treatment Via Body Lumens&#8221; issued April 22, 2014. Israeli Patent No. 198,188 entitled &#8220;Bifurcated Stent Assemblies&#8221; issued May 1, 2014 and Israeli Patent No. 198,665 entitled &#8220;Optimized Stent Jacket&#8221; issued May 28, 2014. U.S. Patent Application No. 11/797,168, filed May 1, 2007, was issued as U.S. Patent No. 8,961,586 on February 24, 2015. Canadian Patent No. 2,666,712 entitled &#8220;Filter Assemblies&#8221; issued March 31, 2015. Canadian Patent No. 2,666,728 entitled &#8220;Knitted Stent Jackets&#8221; issued June 23, 2015. U.S. Patent No. 9,132,261 entitled &#8220; In Vivo Filter Assembly&#8221; and U.S. Patent No. 9,132,003, entitled &#8220;Optimized Drug-Eluting Stent Assembly&#8221; each issued September 15, 2015. Canadian Patent No. 2,843,097 entitled &#8220;Stent Apparatuses for Treatment Via Body Lumens and Methods of Use&#8221; issued October 27, 2015. Chinese Patent No. 201210320950.3 entitled &#8220;Knitted Stent Jackets&#8221; issued December 2, 2015. Chinese Patent No. ZL201210454357.8, entitled &#8220;Optimized Stent Jacket&#8221; issued December 9, 2015. We also believe that one or more additional pending patent applications, upon issuance, will cover our existing products. We also believe that the patent applications we have filed, in particular those covering the use of a knitted micron-level mesh sleeve over a stent for various indications, if issued as patents with claims substantially in their present form, would likely create a significant barrier for another company seeking to use similar technology. 

&#160;

Trademarks 

&#160;

We use the InspireMD &#174; , MGuard &#174; and MGuard Prime &#174; trademarks in connection with our products. We have registered these trademarks in the European Union. The trademarks are renewable indefinitely, so long as we make the appropriate filings when required. We also have registrations for Carenet &#174; , CGuard &#174; and the MNP Micronet Protection Logo in the European Union and a supplemental registration for Micronet &#174; in the United States. We have also applied to register the names Carenet&#8482;, CGuard&#8482; InspireMD&#8482;, SmartFit&#8482;, PVGuard TM , NGuard TM , AGuard TM ,and MGuard Prime&#8482; as trademarks in the United States We also use and may have common law rights to various trademarks, trade names, and service marks.

&#160; 

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160;

The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the European Union CE mark, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other corresponding foreign agencies.

&#160;

Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. These laws and regulations range from simple product registration requirements in some countries to complex clearance, clinical tests and production controls in others. As a result, the processes and time periods required to obtain foreign marketing approval may be longer or shorter than those necessary to obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration market authorization. These differences may affect the efficiency and timeliness of international market introduction of our products. For countries in the European Union, medical devices must display a CE mark before they may be imported or sold. In order to obtain and maintain the CE mark, we must comply with the Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC by presenting comprehensive technical files for our products and passing initial and annual quality management system audit inspections to the ISO 13485 standard by an European Notified Body. We have obtained ISO 13485 quality system certification and the products we currently distribute into the European Union display the required CE mark. In order to maintain certification, we are required to pass annual facilities audit inspections conducted by European Notified Body inspectors.

&#160;

As noted below, we have regulatory approval and are selling MGuard Prime EPS, CGuard EPS or both products either through distributors pursuant to distribution agreements or directly , in the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In addition, we have distribution agreements for our products in Uzbekistan, Canada, Venezuela, Kazakhstan, and Armenia, although we have not yet obtained regulatory approval to sell our products in those countries, and we are awaiting regulatory approval to sell our products in Russia and Malaysia. While each of the European Union member countries accepts the CE mark as its sole requirement for marketing approval, some of these countries still require us to take additional steps in order to gain reimbursement rights for our products. Furthermore, while we believe that certain of the above-listed countries that are not members of the European Union accept the CE mark as a primary requirement for marketing approval, each such country requires additional regulatory requirements for final marketing approval of our products. Furthermore, we are currently targeting additional countries in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, however, even if all governmental regulatory requirements are satisfied in each such country, we anticipate that obtaining marketing approval in each country could take as few as three months or as many as twelve months or more, due to the nature of the approval process in each individual country, including typical wait times for application processing and review, as discussed in greater detail below.

&#160;

In October 2007, our first generation MGuard stent combining the MicroNet with a stainless steel stent received CE mark approval for the treatment of coronary artery disease in the European Union. We subsequently replaced the first generation MGuard product with MGuard Prime EPS, which uses a more advanced cobalt-chromium based stent. Our MGuard Prime EPS received CE mark approval in the European Union in October 2010 and marketing approval in those countries listed in the table below. We are currently seeking marketing approval for the MGuard Prime EPS in India, Malaysia, Russia and Singapore. We are focused on seeking marketing approval in these countries because we believe that these countries represent the strongest opportunities for us to grow with respect to our sales.

&#160;

The CGuard EPS received CE mark approval in the European Union on March 14, 2013 and marketing approval in those countries listed in the table below. We are currently seeking marketing approval for the CGuard EPS in Brazil and Russia.

&#160;

&#160;

(1) We have made sales to distributors in this country, but based upon information from such distributors, we believe that the product has not been sold to customers in this country.

&#160;

(2) Due to the changes made to the relevant regulations in Malaysia that became effective in November 2015, we are required to register our product. Sales of MGuard Prime EPS were made to our distributor in Malaysia prior to the date such change became effective. On November 29, 2015 we initiated registration process required pursuant to the amended regulation.

&#160;

&#160;(3) Following the voluntary field action, the Russian ministry of health is holding the registration of MGuard Prime EPS pending its approval of subsequent bench testing results initially submitted on November 18, 2015, and supplementary information submitted on February 26, 2016.

&#160;

(4) We believe that we have regulatory approval for MGuard Prime EPS in South Africa based upon information from our distributor in such country, who was responsible for obtaining the regulatory approval for MGuard Prime EPS. However, the certificate evidencing regulatory approval is held by our distributor and we cannot guarantee that it is in full force and effect.

&#160;

In the United States, the medical devices that will be manufactured and sold by us will be subject to laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including regulations concerning the prerequisites to commercial marketing, the conduct of clinical investigations, compliance with the Quality System Regulation and labeling. We anticipate that our CGuard EPS will be classified as a Class III medical device by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

&#160;

A manufacturer may seek market authorization for a new medical device through the rigorous premarket approval application process, which first requires that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determine that the device is safe and effective for the purposes intended.

&#160;

We will also be required to register with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a medical device manufacturer. As such, our manufacturing facilities will be subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspections for compliance with Quality System Regulation. These regulations will require that we manufacture our products and maintain our documents in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing and quality control activities. As a medical device manufacturer, we will further be required to comply with U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements regarding the reporting of adverse events associated with the use of our medical devices, as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations also govern product labeling and prohibit a manufacturer from marketing a medical device for unapproved applications. If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration believes that a manufacturer is not in compliance with the law, it can institute enforcement proceedings to detain or seize products, issue a recall, enjoin future violations and assess civil and criminal penalties against the manufacturer, its officers and employees. 

&#160;

Customers 

&#160; 

Our customer base is varied. We began shipping our product to customers in Europe in January 2008 and have since expanded our global distribution network to Southeast Asia, India, Latin America and Israel. We currently have distribution agreements for our CE mark-approved MGuard Prime EPS and/or CGuard EPS with medical product distributors based in Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, Australia, South Africa and Latin America. We are currently in discussions with additional distribution companies in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Unless otherwise indicated below, all of the distribution agreements described under &#8220;Customers&#8221; are subject to automatic annual extensions unless affirmatively terminated.

&#160;

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, 79% of our revenue was generated in Europe, and 17% of our revenue was generated in Latin America, with the remaining 4% of our revenue generated in the rest of the world. Our major customers in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 were Avidal Group GmbH, a distributor in Germany that accounted for 11% of our revenues, and Cardio Medical Sales L.P, a distributor in Belarus that accounted for 10% of our revenues.

&#160;

Our agreement with Avidal Group GmbH grants Avidal Group GmbH the right to be a distributor of MGuard Prime EPS and CGuard EPS in Germany until March 2017, subject to the achievement of certain order minimums. Under our agreement with Avidal Group GmbH, as amended, Avidal Group GmbH was required to purchase 850 MGuard Prime EPS and 225 CGuard EPS from us in 2015. Although Avidal Group GmbH did not adhere to their order minimum for 2015, we did not terminate their right to be our distributor of MGuard Prime EPS and CGuard EPS in Germany.

&#160;

Our agreement with Cardio Medical Sales L.P grants Cardio Medical Sales L.P the right to be the exclusive distributor of MGuard Prime EPS and CGuard EPS in Belarus until December 2016, subject to the achievement of certain order minimums. Under our agreement with Cardio Medical Sales L.P, Cardio Medical Sales L.P is required to purchase 450 MGuard Prime EPS from us in 2015, 70 MGuard Prime EPS in 2016 and 30 CGuard EPS in 2016. Although Cardio Medical Sales L.P did not adhere to their order minimum for 2015, we did not terminate their right to be our exclusive distributor of MGuard Prime EPS and CGuard EPS in Belarus. 

&#160;

Penumbra Distribution Agreement 

&#160;

On August 5, 2015, InspireMD, Ltd., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a distribution agreement with Penumbra, Inc., pursuant to which Penumbra, Inc. will act as the exclusive distributor of CGuard EPS in Austria, France, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, Portugal, Switzerland and the United Kingdom and Ireland. The territory covered by the distribution agreement also includes non-exclusive rights to distribute CGuard EPS in Latvia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany and Poland.

&#160;

Under the terms of the distribution agreement, we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all required permits, licenses and other approvals necessary to import, market or sell the CGuard EPS in the territory covered by the distribution agreement. Within 60 days after receipt of all such required approvals in a given territory, Penumbra, Inc. shall place its initial stocking order for CGuard EPS, for which Penumbra, Inc. will pay one-half of the purchase price upon placing such order and the remainder of the purchase price 30 days after receipt of the CGuard products and our invoice for such CGuard EPS products. If, in our reasonable discretion, Penumbra, Inc. fails to order a sufficient quantity of CGuard EPS to successfully commercialize the CGuard EPS in the applicable territory, then we may reduce the territory covered by the distribution agreement upon providing 60 days&#8217; notice to Penumbra, Inc.

&#160;

The distribution agreement requires Penumbra, Inc. to use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase CGuard EPS in certain minimum target amounts agreed to by the parties for the 2015 and 2016 calendar years. For all subsequent calendar years during the term of the distribution agreement, the parties will agree to the minimum annual purchase targets at least 30 days prior to the commencement of such calendar year, which shall be determined in good faith by mutual agreement, taking into account various relevant factors, such as the sales attained during the preceding calendar year and prevailing market conditions, among others. The parties fixed the initial prices to be paid by Penumbra, Inc. for CGuard EPS through December 31, 2015, which were subject to certain reductions for inventory shelf life and other adjustments negotiated by the parties.

&#160;

The initial term of the distribution agreement ends on December 31, 2018, unless sooner terminated pursuant to the termination rights set forth therein. Either party may terminate the distribution agreement (i) without cause upon providing 60 days&#8217; notice to the other party, (ii) upon the other party&#8217;s material breach of the distribution agreement, which is not cured 30 days after written notice thereof from the non-breaching party and (iii) immediately without notice upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution, assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar event with respect to the other party. We may also terminate the distribution agreement if it reasonably believes that Penumbra, Inc., or any party acting on its behalf, has violated the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. In addition, if at any time during the term of the distribution agreement, Penumbra, Inc. distributes or offers for sale products that, in our reasonable judgment, compete with CGuard EPS, then we may terminate the distribution agreement or change the exclusive rights granted to non-exclusive rights upon providing 30 days&#8217; notice to Penumbra, Inc.

&#160;

&#160; 18 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Pursuant to the distribution agreement, we are subject to customary covenants and other continuing regulatory, record-keeping and reporting obligations.

&#160;

The distribution agreement also contains a limited three year warranty for CGuard EPS and other mutual confidentiality and indemnification obligations for us and Penumbra, Inc.

&#160;

Current and future agreements with distributors stipulate that, while we are responsible for training, providing marketing guidance, marketing materials, and technical guidance, distributors will be responsible for carrying out local registration, sales and marketing activities. In addition, in most cases, all sales costs, including sales representatives, incentive programs, and marketing trials, will be borne by the distributor. Under current agreements, distributors purchase stents from us at a fixed price. Our current agreements with distributors are generally for a term of approximately three years.

&#160;

Manufacturing and Suppliers &#160;

&#160;

The polymer fiber for MicroNet is supplied by Biogeneral, Inc., a San Diego, California-based specialty polymer manufacturer for medical and engineering applications.

&#160;

Natec Medical Ltd. supplies us with catheters that help create the base for our CGuard EPS stents. Our agreement with Natec Medical Ltd., which may be terminated by us upon eight months&#8217; notice, calls for a minimum order of 2,000 catheters and commitment to purchase the remaining stock of components for production of the catheters in the event we fail to meet the minimum order for up to approximately $87,000 in 2016.

&#160;

Natec Medical Ltd. supplies us with catheters that help create the base for our MGuard Prime EPS. Our agreement with Natec Medical Ltd., which may be terminated by either party upon six months&#8217; notice, calls for non-binding minimum orders.

&#160;

The cobalt-chromium stent for our MGuard Prime EPS was designed by Svelte Medical Systems Inc. We have an agreement with Svelte Medical Systems Inc., as amended, that grants us a non-exclusive, worldwide license for production and use of the MGuard Prime cobalt-chromium stent for the life of the stent&#8217;s patent, subject to the earlier termination of the agreement upon the bankruptcy of either party or the uncured default by either party under any material provision of the agreement. Our royalty payments to Svelte Medical Systems Inc. are determined by the sales volume of MGuard Prime EPS. Currently, the royalty rate is 2.9% of all net sales. We have mutual indemnification obligations with Svelte Medical Systems Inc. for any damages suffered as a result of third party actions based upon breaches of representations and warranties or the failure to perform certain covenants in the license agreement, and Svelte Medical Systems Inc. will also indemnify us for any damages suffered as a result of third party actions based upon intellectual property or design claims against the cobalt-chromium stent for the MGuard Prime EPS.

&#160;

We manufacture our CGuard EPS and MGuard Prime EPS at our own facility. The bare-metal cobalt-chromium stents for our MGuard Prime EPS and the self-expanding bare-metal stents for our CGuard EPS are being manufactured and supplied by MeKo Laserstrahl-Materialbearbeitung. Our agreement with MeKo Laserstrahl-Materialbearbeitung for the production of electro polished L605 bare-metal stents for MGuard Prime EPS and CGuard EPS is priced on a per-stent basis, subject to the quantity of stents ordered. The complete assembly process for MGuard Prime EPS and CGuard EPS, including knitting and securing the sleeve to the stent and the crimping of the sleeve stent on to a balloon catheter, is done at our Israel manufacturing site. Once MGuard Prime EPS and CGuard EPS have been assembled, they are sent for sterilization in Germany and then back to Israel for final packaging.

Each MGuard stent is manufactured from two main components, the stent and the mesh polymer. The stent is made out of cobalt chromium. This material is readily available and we acquire it in the open market. The mesh is made from polyethylene terephthalate. This material is readily available in the market as well, because it is used for many medical applications. In the event that our supplier can no longer supply this material in fiber form, we would need to qualify another supplier, which could take several months. In addition, in order to retain the approval of the CE mark, we are required to perform periodic audits of the quality control systems of our key suppliers in order to insure that their products meet our predetermined specifications

&#160; 

A CGuard EPS consists of a CGuard stent and the delivery system. Each CGuard stent is manufactured from two main components, a self-expending stent and the mesh polymer. The stent is made out of nitinol. This material is readily available and we acquire it in the open market. The mesh is made from polyethylene terephthalate. We have pending patent rights that cover the proposed CGuard stent with mesh. This material is readily available in the market as well, because it is used for many medical applications. In the event that our supplier can no longer supply this material in fiber form, we would need to qualify another supplier, which could take several months. The delivery system for CGuard is made out of polymer tubes we acquire from an original equipment manufacturer. In the event that our supplier can no longer supply this material, we would need to qualify another supplier, which could take several months. In addition, in order to retain the approval of the CE mark, we are required to perform periodic audits of the quality control systems of our key suppliers in order to insure that their products meet our predetermined specifications.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of March 28, 2016, we had 40 full-time employees. Except for one of our employees in Europe, our employees are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. We do not expect the collective bargaining agreements to which our employees are party to have a material effect on our business or results of operations. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel.
