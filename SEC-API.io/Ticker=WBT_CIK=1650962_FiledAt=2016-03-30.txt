Market and Industry 

Global foodservice sales, which account for the value of all food prepared away from home, is the most important driver of our industry. The global foodservice industry was estimated at approximately $2.7 trillion in 2014 according to Euromonitor International, and is expected to increase at a nominal compounded annual growth rate ("CAGR") of 7% to reach $3.5 trillion by 2018. According to Euromonitor International, the U.S. foodservice market accounted for approximately 19%, or $506 billion, of the total global foodservice market in 2014. We estimate the size of the global foodservice equipment markets we serve to be approximately $27 billion. 

Demand in the restaurant segment, one of seven and our largest end market within the U.S. foodservice industry, is driven by consumer disposable income, employment, investment in new establishments, and the underlying trend for increased convenience. 

Foodservice Equipment and Supplies, an industry publication, estimates that in 2016 for U.S. commercial businesses in need of foodservice equipment, 62% of equipment purchases will be to replace existing equipment, 20% for renovations, 11% for more environmentally friendly or sustainable equipment, and 7% for new construction.

According to Technomic, the foodservice industry in the U.S. is expected to grow at a nominal CAGR of approximately 2% during the 2015-2020 period with some foodservice industry sectors, such as healthcare or fast casual dining growing at the nominal CAGR of 4-6% during the same time period. Management expects that foodservice industry growth within the U.S. will be supported by improving economic conditions, declining rate of unemployment and accelerating increases in real disposable income. Additionally, as a more health conscious public is forsaking convenience foods for fresh, natural alternatives and is focusing on how their food is made, sourced, handled, and prepared, demand for foodservice equipment is expected to rise as foodservice providers adapt to evolving tastes. 

On a global level, the demand for affordable dining is expected to continue to increase. Consumers in every market are expected to continue gravitating towards more informal options, a trend seen among both high income consumers looking to save during a slow economic recovery, and lower income consumers new to foodservice looking for accessible entry points. For foodservice equipment operators in emerging markets, this offers enormous room for innovation, particularly in terms of format, as consumers new to eating out look to experiment with a variety of brands and experiences. Fast-food chains, in particular, have proved successful in these markets in serving occasions where they have historically been weak, such as dinner. 

Per Euromonitor International, global growth is expected to be driven by solid performance in Asia, Latin America, Middle East and Africa as follows: 

&#8226; 

In APAC, foodservice industry sales are projected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 3%, or by $200 billion, during the 2014-2019 period. China is expected to be a major contributor to this region&#8217;s absolute dollar sales growth, despite somewhat challenging market conditions recently. The highest growth is APAC is projected in the juice/smoothie bars and pizza full-service restaurants segments with CAGRs of approximately 13% and 12%, respectively. 

&#8226; 

In Latin America, foodservice industry sales are expected to grow at an approximately 3% CAGR, or by $50 billion, during the 2014-2019 period. The most significant absolute sales dollar growth is expected in Brazil. The highest growth in Latin America overall is projected in the fast-food category with CAGR of approximately 4%, but the largest regional growth opportunities are projected in juice/smoothie bar category with estimated CAGR of approximately 12% during the 2014-2019 period. 

- 8 - 

&#8226; 

In the Middle East and Africa region (&#8220;MEA&#8221;), foodservice industry sales are expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 4% or by $25 billion during the 2014-2019 period. While Sub-Saharan Africa is likely to be one of the most important regions for growth in the long-term, over the next several years the majority of sales in the region will continue to come from the Middle East and the Gulf States in particular. The largest growth opportunities in MEA are expected in the burger fast-food category with a projected CAGR of approximately 10% during the 2014-2019 period. 

In Western Europe, consumers have become much more value-conscious, and increasingly look to modern chains as the best way to spend on eating out. Foodservice sales in Western Europe are projected to grow at an approximately 1% CAGR during the 2014-2019 period according to Euromonitor International. In Eastern Europe, sales are expected to grow with an approximately 2% CAGR during the 2014-2019 period, with the strongest growth projected in convenience stores and fast-food. 

Overall, we believe that continued growth in demand for foodservice equipment will result from the development of new restaurant concepts in the U.S., and the expansion of U.S. and foreign chains into international markets, the replacement and upgrade of existing equipment and new equipment requirements resulting from menu changes. We expect to benefit from these trends, and grow market penetration alongside our customers as they expand into new service categories and geographies. We believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of worldwide growth opportunities with global and regional new product introductions, improvement in operational excellence, and other strategic initiatives.

Product Innovation 

MFS strives to deliver products that enable our customers to provide fresh, new food experiences to consumers outside the home globally. Customer demands are constantly changing, and a more health-conscious public is looking for fresh, natural alternatives to traditional out-of-home eating options, and increasingly cares about how food is sourced, handled and prepared. MFS is focused on providing our customers with the equipment they need to build on the opportunities from these dynamic changes in the market. 

Through innovation, we strive to simplify restaurant operations, improve the quality of the food, improve speed and flexibility of the restaurant operation, and reduce the overall carbon foot print and life cycle operating cost of the equipment. We believe that these benefits will be delivered from our innovation portfolio consisting of mobile connectivity and monitoring, and from stepchange improvements in operator productivity, speed and flexibility, energy efficiency, and health and sanitation. 

&#8226; 

Mobile Connectivity and Monitoring: &#32;Integration of mobile devices in kitchens is increasing rapidly, and will extend the user interface beyond the traditional boundaries of the equipment. The combination of wearables and beacons can provide notification of key tasks and equipment situations requiring immediate attention even if the foodservice preparation crew is not looking at the appliance. Bluetooth allows for secure information exchange using cellular or network mobile devices to collect information on the equipment, view training or maintenance instructions, and update menus and equipment software. RFID tracking of food and holding trays helps ensure the right food in the right quantities is available when needed. Our KitchenConnect series also includes a system for equipment monitoring which collects data to reduce downtime, optimize energy use, and improve service response time. 

&#8226; 

Productivity, Speed and Flexibility: Kitchens that occupy less space, have higher output and are easier to operate are key to growth in the foodservice industry, particularly in urban locations; greater speed and equipment flexibility also allow for higher productivity and a wider range of menu options. For example, restaurants increasingly require smaller zones that can be individually controlled, enabling variable temperature cooking across the surface with lower standby energy losses, and we are a leading provider of such surface cooking platforms. We are also expanding the use of impingement microwave ovens by adding steam and inverter control to the magnetron, which enables better control over moisture levels in the food and the microwave heating rate, and makes the oven much easier to clean with steam. Innovative control systems can improve information flow in the kitchen by letting operators know what and when to cook, and how to maintain and clean the equipment. Our fitkitchen initiative addresses all these procedures holistically, and provides us with unique insights on how to apply and improve our equipment. 

&#8226; 

Energy Efficiency: &#32;We are focused on increasing the efficiency of individual components and reducing standby energy losses. An example of reducing standby energy loss is the use of induction heating for holding pans so that energy is only used when a thermal load is present. We are also leading in the area of high efficiency combustion systems with metal matrix burner technology. This technology reduces gas consumption and allows for variable firing rate. For cooling, natural refrigerants such as R-290 offer improved thermodynamic performance, and variable speed compressors and fans further increase overall cycle performance under part load conditions. 

&#8226; 

Health and Sanitation: Manual sanitation of equipment in the restaurant has become a major challenge due to extended operating hours, the increasing number and complexity of equipment in kitchens, and competing demands from revenue producing tasks. For the cold product category, our HEPA filtration technology brings the cleanroom into the kitchen, controlling airborne contamination of ice machines. Electrically charged particles of water and UV light provide the basis for automated sterilization of food zones and contact surfaces in equipment. Compact steam generators are being embedded in our equipment, providing a proven technology for cleaning cooking cavities in our ovens. 

We have a strong track record of working with customers to develop equipment platforms from scratch, taking into account freshness, flavor and speed of service, as well as constraints of building infrastructure, kitchen ventilation and HVAC systems. Developing products that give our customers a competitive advantage is at the core of our innovation strategy, and we believe that big opportunities to further advance the interaction of equipment, food and people in the kitchen still lie ahead in the foodservice industry. The following graphic depicts our fitkitchen concept:

Additionally, we have a strong base of mid-sized customers and are focused on expanding it further. According to Euromonitor International, many mid-size chains exhibited growth above 20% in 2014, particularly in APAC and Latin America, reflecting the increasing power of local players and strong demand for chained versions of local favorites. Driven by a clear pattern of investment in locally-owned chains and concepts featuring local cuisine, these trends are expected to continue over the long term. We work with each of our mid-size customers to help them capitalize on these trends through our innovation process, which allows us to provide them with the following value propositions: 

&#8226; 

Simplification of their operations; 

&#8226; 

Improved speed and flexibility of the overall operation; 

&#8226; 

Improved quality of the food and service; 

&#8226; 

Reduced energy consumption and carbon footprint; 

- 16 - 

&#8226; 

Lower total cost over the life cycle of the appliance; and 

&#8226; 

Superior reliability of the overall equipment system. 

We do not typically have long-term contracts with our customers; however, large chains frequently authorize specific foodservice equipment manufacturers as approved vendors for particular products, and thereafter, sales are made locally or regionally to end customers via kitchen equipment suppliers, dealers or distributors. Many large quick-service restaurant chains refurbish or open a large number of outlets, or implement menu changes requiring investment in new equipment, over a short period of time. When this occurs, these customers often choose a small number of manufacturers whose approved products may or must be purchased by restaurant operators. We work closely with our customers to develop the products they need and to become approved vendors for these products. 

Our end-customers often need equipment upgrades that enable them to improve productivity and food safety, reduce labor costs, respond to enhanced hygiene, environmental and menu requirements or reduce energy consumption. These changes often require customized cooking and cooling and freezing equipment. In addition, many restaurants seek to differentiate their products by changing their menu and format. We believe that product development is important to our success because a supplier&#8217;s ability to provide customized or innovative foodservice equipment is a primary factor when customers are making their purchasing decisions. Our significant investment in new product research and development positions us to uniquely serve our global customer base. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

We sell our products through a worldwide network of over 3,000 dealers and &#32;distributors in over 100 countries. Our network is differentiated from competitors through serving as a single source for a broad portfolio of leading brands and product categories.

Seasonality 

Typically, the second and third quarters of our fiscal year represent the best periods for our financial results. Our customers are primarily in the northern hemisphere, and the warmer summer weather generally leads to an increase in construction and remodeling within the foodservice industry, as well as in the use and replacement of ice machines. As a result, distributors build inventories during the second quarter to prepare for increased demand. 

Raw Materials 

We support our region-of-use production strategy with corresponding region-of-use supplier partners. The primary raw materials that we use are structural and rolled steel, aluminum, and copper. We also purchase electrical equipment and other semi- and fully-processed materials. We maintain inventories of steel and other purchased material. We have been successful in our goal to maintain alternative sources of raw materials and supplies, and therefore are not dependent on a single source for any particular raw material or supply. 

Engineering, Research and Development 

We believe our extensive engineering, research and development capabilities are a key driver of our success. We engage in research and development activities at 15 &#32;dedicated locations in the Americas, EMEA and APAC. We have a staff of in-house engineers and technicians on three continents, supplemented with external engineering resources, who collectively are responsible for improving existing products and developing new products. We incurred total engineering costs of $47.9 million, $52.6 million , and $42.6 million &#32;during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which included research and development costs of $26.1 million , $31.0 million , and $28.7 million &#32;during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Our team of engineers focuses on developing cost effective, innovative, high-performance, low-maintenance products that are intended to solve problems for our customers in differentiated ways and create significant brand loyalty among customers. Design engineers work closely with our culinary, manufacturing and marketing staff which enables us to identify changing end-user requirements, implement new technologies and effectively introduce product innovations. Close, carefully managed relationships with dealers, distributors and end users help us identify their needs, for not only products, but also for the service and support that are critical to their profitable operations. As part of our ongoing commitment to provide superior products, we intend to continue our efforts to design products that meet evolving customer demands and reduce the period from product conception to product introduction. 

Key projects and initiatives that are the basis for maintaining a competitive advantage in our capabilities for engineering and product development include the following:
