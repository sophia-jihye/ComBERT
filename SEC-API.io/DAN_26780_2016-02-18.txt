Geographic Operations 

&#160; 

We maintain administrative and operational organizations in North America, Europe, South America and Asia Pacific to support our operating segments, assist with the management of affiliate relations and facilitate financial and statutory reporting and tax compliance on a worldwide basis. Our operations are located in the following countries: 

&#160; 

North America 

Europe 

South America 

Asia Pacific 

Canada 

Belgium 

South Africa 

Argentina

&#160; 

Our non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates manufacture and sell products similar to those we produce in the United States. Operations outside the U.S. may be subject to a greater risk of changing political, economic and social environments, changing governmental laws and regulations, currency revaluations and market fluctuations than our domestic operations. See the discussion of risk factors in Item 1A. 

&#160; 

Sales reported by our non-U.S. subsidiaries comprised $3,255 &#32;of our 2015 &#32;consolidated sales of $ 6,060 . A summary of sales and long-lived assets by geographic region can be found in Note 18 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 

Customer Dependence 

&#160; 

We are largely dependent on light vehicle, medium- and heavy-duty vehicle and off-highway original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers. Ford Motor Company (Ford) was the only individual customer accounting for 10% or more of our consolidated sales in 2015 . As a percentage of total sales from operations, our sales to Ford were approximately 20% &#32;in 2015 , 18% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 18% &#32;in 2013 &#32;and our sales to PACCAR, our second largest customer, were approximately 8% in 2015 , 9% in 2014 &#32;and 8% in 2013 . Hyundai Mobis, Nissan Motor Corporation and Tata Motors were our third, fourth and fifth largest customers in 2015 . Our 10 largest customers collectively accounted for approximately 58% &#32;of our sales in 2015 . 

Loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to Ford or other large volume customers would have a significant adverse effect on our financial results until such lost sales volume could be replaced and there is no assurance that any such lost volume would be replaced. 

&#160; 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

We use a variety of raw materials in the production of our products, including steel and products containing steel, stainless steel, forgings, castings and bearings. Other commodity purchases include aluminum, brass, copper and plastics. These materials are typically available from multiple qualified sources in quantities sufficient for our needs. However, some of our operations remain dependent on single sources for certain raw materials. 

&#160; 

While our suppliers have generally been able to support our needs, our operations may experience shortages and delays in the supply of raw material from time to time, due to strong demand, capacity limitations, short lead times, production schedule increases from our customers and other problems experienced by the suppliers. A significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers could adversely impact our ability to meet our production schedules and to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our businesses are generally not seasonal. However, in the light vehicle market, our sales are closely related to the production schedules of our OEM customers and those schedules have historically been weakest in the third quarter of the year due to a large number of model year change-overs that occur during this period. Additionally, third-quarter production schedules in Europe are typically impacted by the summer vacation schedules and fourth-quarter production is affected globally by year-end holidays. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

A substantial amount of the new business we are awarded by OEMs is granted well in advance of a program launch. These awards typically extend through the life of the given program. This backlog of new business does not represent firm orders. We estimate future sales from new business using the projected volume under these programs. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Within each of our markets, we compete with a variety of independent suppliers and distributors, as well as with the in-house operations of certain OEMs. With a renewed focus on product innovation, we differentiate ourselves through efficiency and performance, reliability, materials and processes, sustainability and product extension.

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our proprietary driveline and power technologies product lines have strong identities in the markets we serve. Throughout these product lines, we manufacture and sell our products under a number of patents that have been obtained over a period of years and expire at various times. We consider each of these patents to be of value and aggressively protect our rights throughout the world against infringement. We are involved with many product lines and the loss or expiration of any particular patent would not materially affect our sales and profits. 

&#160; 

We own or have licensed numerous trademarks that are registered in many countries, enabling us to market our products worldwide. For example, our Spicer&#174;, Victor Reinz&#174; and Long&#174; trademarks are widely recognized in their market segments. 

&#160; 

Engineering and Research and Development 

&#160; 

Since our introduction of the automotive universal joint in 1904, we have been focused on technological innovation. Our objective is to be an essential partner to our customers and we remain highly focused on offering superior product quality, technologically advanced products, world-class service and competitive prices. To enhance quality and reduce costs, we use statistical process control, cellular manufacturing, flexible regional production and assembly, global sourcing and extensive employee training. 

&#160; 

We engage in ongoing engineering and research and development activities to improve the reliability, performance and cost-effectiveness of our existing products and to design and develop innovative products that meet customer requirements for new applications. We are integrating related operations to create a more innovative environment, speed product development, maximize efficiency and improve communication and information sharing among our research and development operations. At December 31, 2015 , we had eight stand-alone technical and engineering centers with additional research and development activities carried out at eight additional sites. Our research and development costs were $75 in 2015 , $72 in 2014 &#32;and $64 in 2013 . Total engineering expenses including research and development were $183 in 2015 , $176 in 2014 &#32;and $165 in 2013 . 

&#160; 

Our research and development activities continue to improve customer value. For all of our markets, this means drivelines with higher torque capacity, reduced weight and improved efficiency. End-use customers benefit by having vehicles with better fuel economy and reduced cost of ownership. We are also developing a number of power technologies products for vehicular and other applications that will assist fuel cell, battery and hybrid vehicle manufacturers in making their technologies commercially viable in mass production.
