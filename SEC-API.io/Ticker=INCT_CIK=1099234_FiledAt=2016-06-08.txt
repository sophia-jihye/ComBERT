(&#8220;Company&#8221;) was formed in Delaware in June 1997 under the name SyCo Comics and Distribution Inc. and is the successor to a limited partnership named SyCo Comics and Distribution formed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia on January 15, 1997, by Sy Robert Picon and William Spears, the co-founders and principal stockholders of the Company. On February 17, 1999, SyCo Comics and Distribution Inc. changed its name to Syconet.com, Inc.

&#160;

On November 21, 2002, the Company amended its articles of incorporation changing its name to Point Group Holdings, Incorporated (see Exhibit 3.2). On March 5, 2003, the Company again amended the articles of incorporation so that (a) an increase in the authorized capital stock of the Company can be approved by the board of directors without shareholder consent; and (b) a decrease in the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company (a reverse split) can be approved by the board of directors without shareholder consent (see Exhibit 3.3). On July 11, 2003, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized common shares to 900,000,000 (see Exhibit 3.4). On January 26, 2004, the name of the Company was changed to &#8220;GameZnFlix, Inc&#8221; by the filing of amended articles of incorporation (see Exhibit 3.5).

&#160;

On December 16, 2004, the Company amended the articles of incorporation to increase the authorized common stock of the Company to 2,000,000,000 shares (see Exhibit 3.6). On July 19, 2005, the articles of incorporation were further amended to increase the number of authorized common shares to 4,000,000,000 (see Exhibit 3.7), and on March 21, 2006 increased to 25,000,000,000 (see Exhibit 3.8). On September 6, 2007, a 1,000 to 1 reverse split of common stock took place. On December 31, 2007, 100,000,000 shares of Series B common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock were created by an amendment to the articles of incorporation, along with reducing the authorized common stock to 5,000,000,000 shares (see Exhibit 3.9). On April 9, 2009, a 10,000 to 1 reverse split of the Company&#8217;s common stock became effective.

&#160;

During the period of July 2002 to September 2002, the Company acquired AmCorp Group, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, and Naturally Safe Technologies, Inc. also a Nevada corporation. In February 2005, AmCorp amended its articles of incorporation, changing its name to GameZnFlix Racing and Merchandising, Inc. AmCorp provided services to companies that desired to be listed on the OTCBB and Naturally Safe held patents on a product that assisted Christmas trees in retaining water. Both these companies have ceased operations. In September 2003, the Company acquired Veegeez.com, LLC, a California limited liability company. This company has ceased operations.

&#160;

&#160;

On April 30, 2009, the Company entered into an Acquisition Agreement with TBC Today, Inc., a Nevada corporation, where the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of TBC. Under this agreement, all 11,000,000 shares of TBC Today, Inc. common stock issued and outstanding will be acquired by the Company for 11,000,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Company. On August 14, 2009, the Company issued 11,000,000 restricted shares of common stock to the shareholders of TBC Today, Inc. in completing this acquisition. This company has ceased operations.

&#160;

On May 7, 2009, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State (see Exhibit 3.10). This amendment changed the name of the Company to TBC Global News Network, Inc. This corporate action had previously been approved by consent of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.

&#160;

On March 19, 2010, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Sterling Yacht Sales, Inc. and it stockholders, Glenn W. McMachen, Sr., and Arlene McMachen (see Exhibit 2.2). Under the terms of this agreement, the Company agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Sterling.

&#160;

On September 1, 2014, the Company determined that Sterling and its stockholders materially breached this agreement and therefore the agreement is null and void. Therefore, Sterling is not a subsidiary of the Company and the Company has no further obligations under this agreement.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Current Business of the Company. 

&#160;

The acquisition of Stimulating Software, Play Celebrity and Inner Four leads to a business model that allows for the development of new rebranded games and other media business opportunities. Stimulating Software and Play Celebrity Games (both referred to as &#8220;GameCo&#8221;) have over 30 active and inactive (341) mobile games and has had over 35,000,000 installs on mobile devices since 2009. The distinction between the companies is while both are free to play or commonly referred to as &#8220;freemium&#8221; with built in upgrades and/or advertising Play Celebrity Games apps are designed to match the Celebrity who has requested the app while Stimulating Software are game apps designed and launch.

&#160;

The Company does not use a standard pay to play system for any of its apps, as the Company wants its users to be able to choose between paying or working for their rewards. The Company&#8217;s freemium games offer in-app purchases to unlock additional features. Users who do not wish to pay also have the choice of watching a 30-second video ad to earn in-app currency which can be used to unlock the same items. Over the period of January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, GameCo generated $46,390 in sales from freemium games (net proceeds after Apple/Google/Amazon take their 30% fees).

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Play Celebrity and Stimulating Software have an agreement with TopFan, which has yet to bring any celebrities to have apps developed. This agreement may in the future present the opportunity to create exciting products for the fans of these celebrities (see Exhibit 10.8 &#8211; the signatories to this agreement are Celebrity Games Corp., now known as Play Celebrity, and Celebrity Games Software, LLC, now known as Stimulating Software). The combined 371 mobile games is a starting point for the business model on a go forward basis. The GameCo mobile apps combined with the celebrities, artists and athletes that will be a part of Play Celebrity (see Exhibit 10.9 for Artists Participation Agreement between Play Celebrity and Stimulating Software, and Marcus Cooper), will make for a business model that allows the company to build new applications by using the games that are already developed. An example of this is the Kim Kardashian application launched in 2014. This application was previously titled twice before finally becoming a hit game featuring Kim Kardashian (commonly referred to as &#8220;Re-Skinning&#8221;). The positive side of re-skinning an existing game is significant. As an example, by resigning you save time, development costs are significantly reduced, testing the product and removing bugs is eliminated or significantly reduced and time to get to market is accelerated from months to days.

&#160;

The combined company began in early 2016 to take the 371 existing games and began the process of re skinning these games. The Company&#8217;s four designer/programmers performed the re-skinning of thirty 30 of the Company&#8217;s inventory of apps and launched them as new apps on Google Play, iTunes and Amazon.

&#160;

The marketing plan for the company involves two key ingredients. The first ingredient is to market new celebrity games to our existing user base. The second key ingredient is to have the artist, celebrity or athlete market the product to their fan base using social networks and other available media. This marketing plan is designed to keep the Company&#8217;s marketing expenses marginal and at the same time allow the Company to continue to expand its base of users.

&#160;

The majority of these installs come from new products under stimulating software and from legacy installations from Inner Four. The vast majority of the games is available in the iTunes store today and can be ported to Google, Amazon and other distribution points. This store expansion is key to the Company&#8217;s 12-month strategy. It is the Company&#8217;s goal to have as many games available on as many available platforms by the end of 2016.

&#160;

Inner Four, Inc., the third company that was acquired, is under development as a Cloud based television network under a master developer agreement with xTV.net. The Company plans include developing channels to present talk shows, music videos, and sporting events.

&#160; 

At the present time, the Company has one employee, who consists of the chief executive officer and number of consultants retained advise the Companies on changes in the market places.
