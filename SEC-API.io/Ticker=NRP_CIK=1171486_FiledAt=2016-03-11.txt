 ITEMS 1. AND 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES 

Partnership Structure and Management 

We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed in 2002. We own, operate, manage and lease a diversified portfolio of mineral properties in the United States, including interests in coal, trona and soda ash, construction aggregates, crude oil and natural gas, frac sand and other natural resources. Our business is organized into four operating segments: 

Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other &#8212;consists primarily of coal royalty, coal related transportation and processing assets, aggregate and industrial minerals royalty assets and timber. Our coal reserves are primarily located in Appalachia, the Illinois Basin and the Western United States. Our aggregates and industrial minerals are located in a number of states across the United States. &#32;&#32; 

Soda Ash &#8212;consists of the Partnership's 49% non-controlling equity interest in a trona ore mining operation and soda ash refinery in the Green River Basin, Wyoming. Ciner Resources LP, our operating partner, mines the trona, processes it into soda ash, and distributes the soda ash both domestically and internationally into the glass and chemicals industries. We receive regular quarterly distributions from this business. &#32; 

VantaCore &#8212;consists of our construction materials business acquired in October 2014 that operates hard rock quarries, an underground limestone mine, sand and gravel plants, asphalt plants and marine terminals. &#32;VantaCore operates in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky and Louisiana. &#32;&#32; 

Oil and Gas &#8212;consists of our non-operated working interests, royalty interests and overriding royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties. Our primary interests in oil and natural gas producing properties are non-operated working interests located in the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana. We also own fee mineral, royalty or overriding royalty interests in oil and gas properties in several other regions, including the Appalachian Basin, Oklahoma and Louisiana. &#32; 

Our Corporate and Financing segment includes functional corporate departments that do not earn revenues. Costs incurred by these departments include corporate headquarters and overhead, financing, centralized treasury and accounting and other corporate-level activity not specifically allocated to a segment. 

Effective for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we changed the organizational structure of the internal financial information reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Operating Officer from a single segment to the four operating segments and corporate segment described above as a result of the acquisitions that have diversified our natural resource asset base. The new segment alignment is presented for the period ending December 31, 2015, with prior periods recast for comparability. 

Our operations are conducted through, and our operating assets are owned by, our subsidiaries. We conduct our business through two wholly owned operating companies: Opco and NRP Oil and Gas. NRP Oil and Gas holds our non-operated oil and gas working interests in the Williston Basin. All of our other operations, including other oil and gas assets, are held by Opco. NRP (GP) LP, our general partner, has sole responsibility for conducting our business and for managing our operations. Because our general partner is a limited partnership, its general partner, GP Natural Resource Partners LLC, conducts its business and operations, and the Board of Directors and officers of GP Natural Resource Partners LLC make decisions on our behalf. Robertson Coal Management LLC, a limited liability company wholly owned by Corbin J. Robertson, Jr., owns all of the membership interest in GP Natural Resource Partners LLC. Subject to the Investor Rights Agreement with Adena Minerals, LLC ("Adena Minerals"), Mr. Robertson is entitled to nominate ten directors to the Board of Directors of GP Natural Resource Partners LLC. Mr. Robertson has delegated the right to nominate two of the directors, one of whom must be independent, to Adena Minerals. 

The senior executives and other officers who manage NRP are employees of Western Pocahontas Properties Limited Partnership and Quintana Minerals Corporation, companies controlled by Mr. Robertson, and they allocate varying percentages of their time to managing our operations. Neither our general partner, GP Natural Resource Partners LLC, nor any of their affiliates receive any management fee or other compensation in connection with the management of our business, but they are entitled to be reimbursed for all direct and indirect expenses incurred on our behalf. 

We have regional offices through which we conduct our operations, the largest of which is located at 5260 Irwin Road, Huntington, West Virginia 25705 and the telephone number is (304) 522-5757. Our principal executive office is located at 1201 Louisiana Street, Suite 3400, Houston, Texas 77002 and our telephone number is (713) 751-7507.

Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other &#32; Segment 

We do not operate any coal mines, but lease our reserves to experienced mine operators under long-term leases that grant the operators the right to mine and sell our reserves in exchange for royalty payments. A typical lease has a five- to ten-year base term, with the lessee having an option to extend the lease for additional terms. Leases may include the right to renegotiate rents and royalties for the extended term. We also own and manage coal related infrastructure assets that generate additional revenues, primarily in the Illinois Basin. In addition, we own or lease aggregates and industrial mineral reserves located in a number of states across the country. We derive a small percentage of our aggregates and industrial mineral revenues by leasing our owned reserves to third party operators who mine and sell the reserves in exchange for royalty payments. 

Under our standard lease, lessees calculate royalty payments due to us and are required to report tons of minerals removed as well as the sales prices of the extracted minerals. Therefore, to a great extent, amounts reported as royalty revenue are based upon the reports of our lessees. We periodically audit this information by examining certain records and internal reports of our lessees, and we perform periodic mine inspections to verify that the information that our lessees have submitted to us is accurate. Our audit and inspection processes are designed to identify material variances from lease terms as well as differences between the information reported to us and the actual results from each property. 

In addition to their royalty obligations, our lessees are often subject to pre-established minimum monthly, quarterly or annual payments. These minimum rentals reflect amounts we are entitled to receive even if no mining activity occurred during the period. Minimum rentals are usually credited against future royalties that are earned as minerals are produced. 

Because we do not operate any coal mines, our coal royalty business does not bear ordinary operating costs and has limited direct exposure to environmental, permitting and labor risks. As operators, our lessees are subject to environmental laws, permitting 

requirements and other regulations adopted by various governmental authorities. In addition, the lessees generally bear all labor-related risks, including retiree health care legacy costs, black lung benefits and workers&#8217; compensation costs associated with operating the mines on our coal and aggregates properties. We typically pay property taxes on our properties, which are then reimbursed by the coal lessee pursuant to the terms of the lease.

Unless otherwise indicated, we present the quality of the coal throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K on an as-received basis, which assumes 6% moisture for Appalachian reserves, 12% moisture for Illinois Basin reserves and 25% moisture for Northern Powder River Basin reserves. 

(2) 

Compliance coal, when burned, emits less than 1.2 pounds of sulfur dioxide per million Btu and meets the sulfur dioxide emission standards imposed by Phase II of the Clean Air Act without blending with other coals or using sulfur dioxide reduction technologies. Compliance coal is a subset of low sulfur coal and is, therefore, also reported within the amounts for low sulfur coal. 

(3) 

For purposes of this table, we have defined metallurgical coal reserves as reserves located in those seams that historically have been of sufficient quality and characteristics to be able to be used in the steel making process. Some of the reserves 

in the metallurgical category can also be used as steam coal. In 2015, approximately 30% &#32;of the production and 38% &#32;of the coal royalty revenues from our properties were from metallurgical coal. 

Methodologies Used in Mineral Reserve Estimation 

All of the reserves reported above are recoverable proven or probable reserves as determined by the SEC&#8217;s Industry Guide 7 and are estimated by our internal reserve engineers. The technologies and economic data used by our internal reserve engineers in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, drill logs, geophysical logs, geologic maps including isopach, mine, and coal quality, cross sections, statistical analysis, and available public production data. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating the quantities and qualities of recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, any one of which may, if incorrect, result in an estimate that varies considerably from actual results. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;Our reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may be inaccurate, which could materially adversely affect the quantities and value of our reserves." 

Major Coal Producing Properties 

The following is a summary of our major coal producing properties in each region: 

Appalachia&#8212;Northern Appalachia 

Area F. &#32; Area F is located in Randolph and Upshur Counties, West Virginia. In 2015, approximately 0.5 million tons were produced from this property. We lease this property to Carter Roag Coal Company, a subsidiary of United Coal Company, LLC (owned by Metinvest). Production comes from the Pleasant Hill Sewell Seam deep mine and is trucked to Carter Roag&#8217;s preparation plant situated at Star Bridge, WV. The coal produced from this lease is a medium to high volatile metallurgical product and shipped via the CSX railroad to Baltimore and then by ocean vessel to Metinvest&#8217;s steel mills situated in Ukraine. 

Hibbs Run. &#32; The Hibbs Run property is located in Marion County, West Virginia. In 2015, approximately 8.5 million tons were produced from the property by Consolidation Coal Company, a subsidiary of Murray Energy Corporation. Coal from this property is produced from longwall mines. The royalty rate for this property is a low fixed rate per ton and has a significant effect on the per ton revenue for the region. Coal is shipped by rail to utility customers.

Pinnacle. The Pinnacle property is located in Wyoming and McDowell Counties, West Virginia. In 2015, approximately 2.4 million tons of metallurgical coal were produced from our reserves on this property. We also own an overriding royalty interest on coal produced from the reserves that we do not own at this property, from which we derive additional revenues. We lease the property to a subsidiary of ERP Compliant Fuels, LLC, Seneca Resources, LLC (formerly leased to a subsidiary of Cliffs Natural Resources, Inc). Production comes from a longwall mine and is transported by beltline to a preparation plant and is then shipped via railroad and barge to both domestic and export customers. 

Lynch. The Lynch property is located in Harlan and Letcher Counties, Kentucky. In 2015, approximately 2.2 million tons were produced from this property. This property was formerly leased to a subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources but was sold to a subsidiary of Revelation Energy, LLC during 2015. Production comes from both underground and surface mines. This property has the ability to ship coal on both the CSX and Norfolk Southern railroads. 

Lone Mountain. The Lone Mountain property is located in Harlan County, Kentucky. In 2015, approximately 1.6 million tons were produced from this property. We lease the property to a subsidiary of Arch Coal, Inc.

We lease these properties to a number of operators including Middlesboro Mining Properties, Inc., Revelation Energy, LLC and Corsa Coal Corp. Production comes from both underground and surface mines and is trucked to preparation plants and loading facilities operated by our lessees. Coal is transported by truck and is shipped via both CSX and Norfolk Southern railroads to utility and industrial customers. The map below shows the location of our major properties in Southern Appalachia: 

Illinois Basin 

Williamson Development. The Williamson property is located in Franklin and Williamson Counties, Illinois. The property is under lease to a subsidiary of Foresight Energy, and in 2015, approximately 5.2 million tons were mined on the property. This production is from a longwall mine and is shipped primarily via the Canadian National railroad to domestic utility customers and to various export customers. 

Hillsboro/Deer Run. The Hillsboro property is located in Montgomery and Bond Counties, Illinois. The property is under lease to a subsidiary of Foresight Energy, and in 2015, approximately 2.6 million tons were shipped from the property. When active, production at the Deer Run mine on our Hillsboro property is from an underground longwall mine and is shipped via either the Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern or Canadian National railroads or by barges to domestic utilities or export customers. The Deer Run mine has been idled since March 2015 as a result of elevated carbon monoxide levels in the mine. In July 2015, we received a notice from Foresight Energy declaring a force majeure event at the mine as a result of the elevated carbon monoxide levels. While we are disputing Foresight Energy&#8217;s claim and have filed a lawsuit in connection therewith, the effect of a valid force majeure declaration would relieve Foresight Energy of its obligation to pay us minimum deficiency payments of $7.5 million per 

quarter, or $30.0 million per year. For more information on the idling of the Deer Run mine, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;Foresight Energy's Deer Run Mine is currently idled as a result of elevated carbon monoxide levels at the mine. If the mine remains idled for an extended period or does not resume operations, our financial condition and results of operations could be aversely affected," included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Macoupin . The Macoupin property is located in Macoupin County, Illinois. The property is under lease to a subsidiary of Foresight Energy, and in 2015, approximately 2.4 million tons were shipped from the property. Production is from an underground mine and is shipped via the Norfolk Southern or Union Pacific railroads or by barge to utility customers such or loaded into barges for shipment to export customers. 

Sahara. The Sahara property is located in Saline, Hamilton and Williamson Counties in Illinois. The property is under lease to a subsidiary of Peabody Energy Corporation and approximately 0.6 million tons were mined on the property during 2015. Production is currently from an underground mine and is shipped via barge primarily to utility customers. 

In addition to these properties, we own loadout and other transportation assets at the Williamson and Macoupin mines and at the Sugar Camp mine, which is another mine operated by Foresight Energy. See "&#8212;Coal Transportation and Processing Assets." The map below shows the location of our major properties in the Illinois Basin: 

Northern Powder River Basin 

Western Energy. The Western Energy property is located in Rosebud and Treasure Counties, Montana. In 2015, approximately 4.9 million tons were produced from our property. A subsidiary of Westmoreland Coal Company has two coal leases on the property. Coal is produced by surface dragline mining, and the coal is transported by either truck or beltline to the four-unit 2,200-megawatt Colstrip generation station located at the mine mouth. The map below shows the location of our property in the Northern Powder River Basin: 

Coal Transportation and Processing Assets 

We own transportation and processing infrastructure related to certain of our coal and aggregates properties. We own loadout and other transportation assets at Foresight Energy's Williamson and Macoupin mines in the Illinois Basin. In addition, we own rail loadout and associated infrastructure at the Sugar Camp mine, an Illinois Basin mine also operated by a subsidiary of Foresight Energy. While we own coal reserves at the Williamson and Macoupin mines, we do not own coal reserves at the Sugar Camp mine. We typically lease this infrastructure to third parties and collect throughput fees; however, at the loadout facility at the Williamson mine in Illinois, we operate the coal handling and transportation infrastructure and have subcontracted out that responsibility to a third party. 

Hard Mineral Royalty and Other Assets 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned an estimated 500 million tons of aggregates reserves located in a number of states across the country. We lease a portion of these reserves to third parties in exchange for royalty payments. We also lease approximately 

120 million tons of these reserves to the Grand Rivers operation in the VantaCore segment. The structure of these leases is similar to our coal leases, and these leases typically also require minimum rental payments in addition to royalties. During 2015, our aggregates lessees produced 2.2 million tons of aggregates from these properties and we received $8.1 million &#32;in aggregates royalty revenues, including overriding royalty revenues. In February 2016, we sold the aggregates reserves and related royalty rights at three aggregates operations located in Texas, Georgia and Tennessee, which comprised approximately 27% , or 139 million &#32;tons, of our aggregates reserves as of December 31, 2015, for $10.0 million &#32;in cash. The properties sold generated approximately $0.9 million in aggregates royalty reserves during 2015. The effective date of the sale was February 1, 2016. 

Through our 51% ownership of BRP LLC ("BRP"), a joint venture with International Paper Company, we own approximately 10 million mineral acres in 31 states. While the vast majority of the 10 million acres remain largely undeveloped, BRP currently holds eight active mineral leases and has an ongoing program to identify additional opportunities to lease its minerals to operating parties. BRP&#8217;s hard mineral royalty and other assets include nearly 95,000 net mineral acres of coal rights (primarily lignite and some bituminous coal) in the Gulf Coast region, of which approximately 4,800 acres are leased in Louisiana, Alabama and Texas. In addition, BRP owns copper rights in Michigan&#8217;s Upper Peninsula that are subject to a development agreement with a copper development company. BRP also holds various other mineral rights including coalbed methane, metals, aggregates, water and geothermal, in several states throughout the United States. 

Soda Ash Segment 

We own a 49% non-controlling equity interest in Ciner Wyoming, which is one of the largest and lowest cost producers of soda ash in the world, serving a global market from its facility located in the Green River Basin of Wyoming. The Green River Basin geological formation holds the largest, and one of the highest purity, known deposits of trona ore in the world. Trona, a naturally occurring soft mineral, is also known as sodium sesquicarbonate and consists primarily of sodium carbonate, or soda ash, sodium bicarbonate and water. Ciner Wyoming processes trona ore into soda ash, which is an essential raw material in flat glass, container glass, detergents, chemicals, paper and other consumer and industrial products. The vast majority of the world&#8217;s accessible trona reserves are located in the Green River Basin. According to historical production statistics, approximately one-quarter of global soda ash is produced by processing trona, with the remainder being produced synthetically through chemical processes. The costs associated with procuring the materials needed for synthetic production are greater than the costs associated with mining trona for trona-based production. In addition, trona-based production consumes less energy and produces fewer undesirable by-products than synthetic production. 

Ciner Wyoming&#8217;s Green River Basin surface operations are situated on approximately 880 acres in Wyoming, and its mining operations consist of approximately 23,500 acres of leased and licensed subsurface mining area. The facility is accessible by both road and rail. Ciner Wyoming uses six large continuous mining machines and ten underground shuttle cars in its mining operations. Its processing assets consist of material sizing units, conveyors, calciners, dissolver circuits, thickener tanks, drum filters, evaporators and rotary dryers. The following map provides an aerial overview of Ciner Wyoming&#8217;s surface operations: 

In trona ore processing, insoluble materials and other impurities are removed by thickening and filtering the liquor, a solution consisting of sodium carbonate dissolved in water. Ciner Wyoming then adds activated carbon to filters to remove organic impurities, which can cause color contamination in the final product. The resulting clear liquid is then crystallized in evaporators, producing sodium carbonate monohydrate. The crystals are then drawn off and passed through a centrifuge to remove excess water. The resulting material is dried in a product dryer to form anhydrous sodium carbonate, or soda ash. The resulting processed soda ash is then stored in seven on-site storage silos to await shipment by bulk rail or truck to distributors and end customers. Ciner Wyoming&#8217;s storage silos can hold up to 65,000 short tons of processed soda ash at any given time. The facility is in good working condition and has been in service for over 50 years. 

The evaporation stage of trona ore processing produces a precipitate and natural by-product called deca. "Deca," short for sodium carbonate decahydrate, is one part soda ash and ten parts water. Solar evaporation causes deca to crystallize and precipitate to the bottom of the four main surface ponds at the Green River Basin facility. Ciner Wyoming&#8217;s deca rehydration process enables 

Ciner Wyoming to reduce waste storage needs and convert what is typically a waste product into a usable raw material. As a result of this process, Ciner Wyoming has been able to reduce the amount of short tons of trona ore it takes to produce one short ton of soda ash. 

The soda ash produced is shipped by rail or truck from the Green River Basin facility. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Ciner Wyoming shipped approximately 96% of its soda ash to customers initially via rail under a contract with Union Pacific that expires on December 31, 2017, and the plant receives rail service exclusively from Union Pacific. Ciner Wyoming leases a fleet of more than 2,000 hopper cars that serve as dedicated modes of shipment to its domestic customers. For export, Ciner Wyoming ships soda ash on unit trains consisting of approximately 100 cars to two primary ports: Port Arthur, Texas and Portland, Oregon. From these ports, the soda ash is loaded onto ships for delivery to ports all over the world. American Natural Soda Ash Corporation ("ANSAC") provides logistics and support services for all of Ciner Wyoming&#8217;s export sales. For domestic sales, Ciner Resources Corporation provides similar services. 

Ciner Wyoming&#8217;s largest customer is ANSAC, which buys soda ash (through Ciner Wyoming&#8217;s sales agent) and other of its member companies for further export to its customers. ANSAC takes soda ash orders directly from its overseas customers and then purchases soda ash for resale from its member companies pro rata based on each member&#8217;s production volumes. ANSAC is the exclusive distributor for its members to the markets it serves. However, Ciner Resources Corporation, on Ciner Wyoming&#8217;s behalf, negotiates directly with, and Ciner Wyoming exports to, customers in markets not served by ANSAC. 

Ciner Wyoming is party to several mining leases and one license for its subsurface mining rights. Some of the leases are renewable at Ciner Wyoming&#8217;s option upon expiration. Ciner Wyoming pays royalties to the State of Wyoming, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and Rock Springs Royalty Company, an affiliate of Anadarko Petroleum, which are calculated based upon a percentage of the quantity or gross value of soda ash and related products at a certain stage in the mining process, or a certain sum per ton of such products. These royalty payments are typically subject to a minimum domestic production volume from the Green River Basin facility, although Ciner Wyoming is obligated to pay minimum royalties or annual rentals to its lessors and licensor regardless of actual sales. The royalty rates paid to Ciner Wyoming&#8217;s lessors and licensor may change upon renewal of such leases and license. Under the license with Rock Springs, the applicable royalty rate may vary based on a most favored nation clause in the license which is currently the subject of litigation in Wyoming. 

As a minority interest owner in Ciner Wyoming, we do not operate and are not involved in the day-to-day operation of the trona ore mine or soda ash production plant. Our partner, Ciner Resources LP manages the mining and plant operations. We appoint three of the seven members of the Board of Managers of Ciner Wyoming and have certain limited negative controls relating to the company. 

VantaCore Segment 

VantaCore is a construction materials company that we acquired on October 1, 2014. VantaCore operates four limestone quarries, one underground limestone mine, six sand and gravel plants, two asphalt plants and two marine terminals. VantaCore is headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and its operations are located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky and Louisiana. As of December 31, 2015, VantaCore controlled approximately 400 million tons of estimated aggregates reserves, including approximately 120 million tons of reserves leased at the Grand Rivers operation from the Coal, Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment. The reserve estimates for each of VantaCore&#8217;s properties were prepared internally and audited by an independent third party advisor. For the year ended December 31, 2015, VantaCore sold approximately 6.0 million tons of crushed stone and gravel, including brokered stone, 1.1 million tons of sand and 0.2 million tons of asphalt. VantaCore&#8217;s four operating businesses are Laurel Aggregates, located in Lake Lynn, Pennsylvania, Winn Materials/McIntosh Construction, located in Clarksville, Tennessee, Grand Rivers, located in Grand Rivers, Kentucky and Southern Aggregates, located near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. VantaCore&#8217;s business is seasonal, with production typically lower in the first quarter of each year due to winter weather. The following map shows the locations of each of VantaCore&#8217;s operations. 

Laurel Aggregates 

Laurel Aggregates is a limestone mining company located in Lake Lynn, Pennsylvania. Its operations consist of a surface and underground mines and use conventional drilling, blasting and crushing methods. The surface mine is located on approximately 100 acres of owned property, and the underground reserves are located on approximately 670 acres of leased property. Laurel pays royalties for material mined and sold from its leased property. Laurel also brokers stone for third party quarries located in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Crushed stone is loaded into third party trucks for delivery to customers located in southwestern Pennsylvania, northeastern West Virginia and eastern Ohio. Laurel&#8217;s customers consist of oilfield service companies, natural gas exploration and production companies and construction and contracting companies. 

Winn Materials/McIntosh Construction 

Winn Materials&#8217; operations consist of two crushed stone quarries and a river terminal, while McIntosh is a complementary asphalt producer and paving company. Together, the two companies function as a vertically integrated unit. The operations of Winn/McIntosh are located in Clarksville, Tennessee, which is located approximately 45 miles northwest of Nashville and is Tennessee&#8217;s fifth largest city. 

Winn mines and produces hard rock limestone using conventional drilling, blasting and crushing methods. Winn primarily leases its properties at its two quarries located in Clarksville and in Trenton, Kentucky and pays royalties for material produced and sold from the leased properties. Winn&#8217;s marine terminal business is located on the Cumberland River, adjacent to Winn&#8217;s Clarksville quarry. Its dock transloads various materials by barge. Through the river terminal, Winn loads out crushed stone and also imports products such as river and granite sand, fertilizer and agricultural products for the local and regional markets. The river terminal is currently being expanded to meet growing demand for additional imported product into these markets. Crushed stone produced at Winn&#8217;s quarries and products imported from the river terminal are loaded onto third party trucks for delivery to Winn&#8217;s customers. 

McIntosh sells asphalt to third parties and also operates its own paving business. Winn supplies most of McIntosh&#8217;s crushed stone and sand used for both its asphalt production and construction needs. The Winn/McIntosh businesses sell to and provide services for residential, commercial and industrial customers. These businesses also supply and provide construction services for infrastructure and highway construction projects primarily within Montgomery County, Tennessee, including for Fort Campbell, one of the largest Army bases in the United States. 

Grand Rivers 

VantaCore purchased this 514 acre hard rock quarry operation located on the Tennessee River near Grand Rivers, Kentucky from one of NRP&#8217;s aggregates lessees that had previously idled the operation. Under VantaCore&#8217;s ownership, this operation continues to lease reserves from NRP and sells its limestone aggregates in both the local market loaded onto third party trucks and to river-based markets through a barge load out terminal. 

The Grand Rivers quarry produces various grades of crushed limestone products mined through its open pit using conventional drilling, blasting and crushing methods performed by a third party mining contractor. Grand Rivers pays royalties for material produced and sold from the leased property to a subsidiary of NRP. Crushed stone is loaded into third party trucks to customers in Kentucky and barges for delivery to customers along the Mississippi River Basin and related waterways. Grand Rivers customers currently consist primarily of ready mix concrete companies and construction and contracting companies. 

Southern Aggregates 

Southern Aggregates is a sand and gravel mining company based in Denham Springs, Louisiana approximately 25 miles northeast of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Southern operates six sand and gravel operations. Suction dredges extract sand and gravel, and the mined material is processed at plants generally located at each site. The plants separate gravel and saleable sand from waste sand and clays, with the waste returned to mined-out sections of pits. The saleable sand and gravel material is loaded onto third party trucks for delivery to Southern&#8217;s customers. Southern leases its mineral reserves and pays royalties for material produced and sold from the leased properties. Southern&#8217;s markets extend approximately 100 miles west and south from its operating locations, including to the cities of Baton Rouge, Lafayette and New Orleans. Southern&#8217;s customers consist primarily of ready mix concrete companies, asphalt producers and contractors. 

Oil and Gas Segment 

We own various interests in oil and gas properties that are located in the Williston Basin, the Appalachian Basin, Louisiana and Oklahoma. Our interests in the Appalachian Basin, Louisiana and Oklahoma are minerals and royalty interests, while in the Williston Basin we own non-operated working interests. Our Williston Basin non-operated working interest properties include the properties acquired in the Sanish Field from an affiliate of Kaiser-Francis Oil Company in November 2014. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we sold certain of our oil and gas royalty interests in the Appalachian Basin. 

We generate oil and gas revenues from non-operated working interests, royalty interests and overriding royalty interests in producing oil and gas wells. Our primary interests in oil and natural gas producing properties are our non-operated working interests located in the Williston Basin, but we also own fee mineral, royalty or overriding royalty interests in oil and gas properties in several other areas, including the Appalachian Basin, the Mississippian Lime formation and northern Louisiana. 

Revenues related to our non-operated working interests in oil and gas assets are recognized on the basis of our net revenue interests in hydrocarbons produced. We also incur capital expenditures and operating expenses associated with the non-operated working interests. Oil and gas royalty revenues include production payments as well as bonus payments and are recognized on the basis of hydrocarbons sold by lessees and the corresponding revenues from those sales. Generally, the lessees make payments based on a percentage of the selling price. Some leases are subject to minimum annual payments or delay rentals. Our revenues fluctuate based on changes in the market prices for oil and natural gas, the decline in production from producing wells, and other factors affecting the third-party oil and natural gas exploration and production companies that operate our wells, including the cost of development and production. 

Our non-operated working interests are all located in the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana. As of December 31, 2015, we had non-operated working interests in 21,832 net acres in the basin, all of which are held by production. These assets include 6,086 net acres in the Sanish Field in Mountrail County, North Dakota that we acquired in November 2014 from an affiliate of Kaiser-Francis Oil Company. The interests acquired in that acquisition are all operated by Whiting Petroleum Corporation and include an estimated average working interest of 14% in approximately 210 wells that were producing as of December 31, 2015. 

We own royalty interests where we have leased certain portions of our owned mineral interests to third parties primarily located in the southern portion of the Appalachian Basin and in the Mississippian Lime in Oklahoma. We also own overriding royalty interests primarily located in the Appalachian Basin in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, including in the Marcellus Shale, and in the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana. In February 2016, we sold royalty and overriding royalty interests in several producing 

properties located in the Appalachian Basin, including our overriding royalty interests in the Marcellus Shale, for $36.6 million in cash. The sale included royalty and overriding royalty interests in approximately 765 gross producing wells as of December 31, 2015 and approximately 10% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2015, or 1,094 MBoe. The effective date of the sale was January 1, 2016. 

Through our 51% ownership of BRP as described above, we also own approximately 300,000 gross acres of oil and gas mineral rights in Louisiana, of which over 53,000 acres were leased as of December 31, 2015. In addition to the leased mineral acreage, BRP holds a 1% overriding royalty interest on approximately 25,000 mineral acres in Louisiana. 

Estimated Proved Oil and Gas Reserves 

Proved reserves are those quantities of crude oil and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates renewal is reasonably certain. In connection with the estimation of proved reserves, the term "reasonable certainty" implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of crude oil, natural gas liquids and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. 

Reserves Presentation 

The following table presents our estimated proved oil and gas reserves and related standardized measure of discounted cash flows as of December 31, 2015 as estimated by Netherland, Sewell &#38; Associates, Inc., our independent reserve engineer:

Standardized measure of discounted cash flows represents the present value of estimated future net revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC (using prices and costs in effect as of the date of estimation), less future development, production and income tax expenses, and discounted at 10% per annum to reflect the timing of future net revenue. 

(3) 

Includes 10,063 MBoe of estimated proved reserves attributable to our non-operated working interests in oil and natural gas properties in the Williston Basin, approximately 3% of which were proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015. 

(4) 

Approximately 10% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2015, or 1,094 MBoe, (all located in the Appalachian Basin) were sold in February 2016. 

Our estimates of proved developed reserves, proved undeveloped reserves, and total proved reserves at December 31, 2015 and 2014 and changes in proved reserves during the last year are presented in the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities (Unaudited) under Item 8. of this Form 10-K. Also presented in the Supplemental Information are the Partnership's estimates of future net cash flows and discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves. See Critical Accounting Estimates under Item 7 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the Partnership&#8217;s proved reserves. 

Technologies Used in Proved Reserves Estimation 

Our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2015, were prepared by Netherland, Sewell &#38; Associates, Inc. ("Netherland Sewell"), our independent reserve engineer. To achieve reasonable certainty, Netherland Sewell employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps including isopach and structure maps, analogy and statistical analysis, and available downhole and production data and well test data. A copy of Netherland Sewell&#8217;s summary report is included as Exhibit 99.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information on our estimated proved reserves, see "Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities" to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Estimated Proved Undeveloped Reserves 

During 2015, we participated in 29 wells in the Williston Basin and incurred $29.1 million of related capital expenditures that resulted in the conversion of 286 MBoe of estimated proved undeveloped reserves to estimated proved developed reserves. As of December 31, 2015, we had no estimated proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for more than five years, and we expect all estimated proved undeveloped reserves reported herein will be developed within the next two years. 

Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process 

Netherland Sewell, our independent reserve engineering firm, estimated, in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission, 100% of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2015. The Netherland Sewell technical personnel responsible for preparing the reserve estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. See Exhibit 99.2 included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the qualifications of Netherland Sewell personnel. 

We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to Netherland Sewell in their reserves estimation process. In the fourth quarter, our technical team was in contact regularly with representatives of Netherland Sewell to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in Netherland Sewell&#8217;s preparation of the year-end reserves estimates. A copy of the Netherland Sewell reserve report was reviewed by our internal technical staff prior to the inclusion of such report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Our Director&#8212;Engineering and Reserves is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Prior to joining NRP, he spent nine years at DeGolyer and MacNaughton as a reservoir engineer working on multiple aspects of reserve evaluation and appraisals. The Director&#8212;Engineering and Reserves reports directly to our Vice President, Oil and Gas. 

Drilling and Development Activities 

We do not operate any wells or conduct any drilling activities. The following table sets forth information with respect to the number of net wells drilled and completed on our properties during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Well information for the year ended December 31, 2013 is not included, as our oil and natural gas producing activities were not material to our results of operations for that year. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, whether or not they produce a reasonable rate of return. Net wells represent the total of our fractional working interests or royalty interests, as applicable, owned in gross wells.

As of December 31, 2015, we also owned non-operated working interests in 19 gross oil wells in various stages of development in the Williston Basin. 

(2) 

67 gross (1.4 net) natural gas and oil wells are attributable to our overriding royalty interest in the Marcellus Shale acquired in 2012. The remaining wells consist primarily of conventional oil and gas wells or coal bed methane that are located in the southern portion of the Appalachian Basin. In February 2016, we sold royalty and overriding royalty interests in approximately 765 gross producing wells in the Appalachian Basin as of December 31, 2015. The effective date of the sale was January 1, 2016.

Significant Customers 

We have a significant concentration of revenues with Foresight Energy and its subsidiaries, with total revenues of $86.6 million &#32;in 2015. The exposure is spread out over four different mining operations. We are currently in a dispute with and have filed a lawsuit against Foresight Energy's subsidiary, Hillsboro Energy, for breach of contract due to wrongful declaration of force majeure at the Deer Run mine. For additional information, see Note 15. "Major Lessees" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and "Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;Foresight Energy's Deer Run Mine is currently idled as a result of elevated carbon monoxide levels at the mine. If the mine remains idled for an extended period or does not resume operations, our financial condition and results of operations could be aversely affected," included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Prior to 2015 we derived more than 10% of our total revenues from Alpha Natural Resources ("Alpha"), our second largest lessee after Foresight Energy. Revenue from Alpha declined from $48.8 million &#32;in 2014 to $34.4 million &#32;in 2015 primarily due to Alpha's idling of mines throughout the year and Alpha's August 2015 bankruptcy filing. While Alpha has recently filed a plan of reorganization with the bankruptcy court, we do not yet have certainty as to which, if any, of our leases will be accepted or assigned in the bankruptcy. To the extent our leases are rejected, Alpha&#8217;s operations on those leases will cease. 

Competition 

We face competition from land companies, coal producers, international steel companies and private equity firms in purchasing coal reserves and royalty producing properties. Numerous producers in the coal industry make coal marketing intensely competitive. Our lessees compete among themselves and with coal producers in various regions of the United States for domestic sales. Lessees compete with both large and small producers nationwide on the basis of coal price at the mine, coal quality, transportation cost from the mine to the customer and the reliability of supply. Continued demand for our coal and the prices that our lessees obtain are also affected by demand for electricity and steel, as well as government regulations, technological developments and the availability and the cost of generating power from alternative fuel sources, including nuclear, natural gas and hydroelectric power. 

The construction aggregates industry that VantaCore operates in is highly competitive and fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in operating in VantaCore&#8217;s local markets. Additionally, VantaCore also competes against large private and public companies, some of which are significantly vertically integrated. Therefore, there is intense competition in a number of markets in which VantaCore operates. This significant competition could lead to lower prices and lower sales volumes in some markets, negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows. 

Our trona mining and soda ash refinery business in the Green River Basin, Wyoming, faces competition from a number of soda ash producers in the United States, Europe and Asia, some of which have greater market share and greater financial, production and other resources than Ciner Wyoming does. Some of Ciner Wyoming&#8217;s competitors are diversified global corporations that have many lines of business and some have greater capital resources and may be in a better position to withstand a long-term deterioration in the soda ash market. Other competitors, even if smaller in size, may have greater experience and stronger relationships in their local markets. Competitive pressures could make it more difficult for Ciner Wyoming to retain its existing customers and attract new customers, and could also intensify the negative impact of factors that decrease demand for soda ash in the markets it serves, such as adverse economic conditions, weather, higher fuel costs and taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that directly or indirectly increase the cost or limit the use of soda ash. 

The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies in that industry who have greater resources than we do. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and may be able to expend greater resources to evaluate properties and attract and maintain industry personnel. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to make acquisitions in times of low commodity prices. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. 

Title to Property 

We owned a significant percentage of our coal and aggregates reserves in fee as of December 31, 2015. We lease the remainder from unaffiliated third parties, including leasing aggregates reserves for VantaCore&#8217;s construction materials business. Ciner Wyoming also leases or licenses its trona reserves. As of December 31, 2015, we owned certain of our oil and gas reserves in fee and leased our non-operated working interests in the Williston Basin from third parties. We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our mineral properties, but we have not had a qualified title company confirm this belief. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in certain cases, such as customary easements, rights-of-way, interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of real property, licenses, prior reservations, leases, liens, restrictions and other encumbrances, we believe that none of these burdens will materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest in them or will materially interfere with their use in the operations of our business. 

For most of our properties, the surface, oil and gas and mineral or coal estates are not owned by the same entities. Some of those entities are our affiliates. State law and regulations in most of the states where we do business require the oil and gas owner to coordinate the location of wells so as to minimize the impact on the intervening coal seams. We do not anticipate that the existence of the severed estates will materially impede development of the minerals on our properties. 

Regulation and Environmental Matters 

General 

Operations on our properties must be conducted in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include matters involving the discharge of materials into the environment, employee health and safety, mine permits and other licensing requirements, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed, management of materials generated by mining operations, surface subsidence from underground mining, water pollution, legislatively mandated benefits for current and retired coal miners, air quality standards, protection of wetlands, plant and wildlife protection, limitations on land use, storage of petroleum products and substances which are regarded as hazardous under applicable laws and management of electrical equipment containing PCBs. Because of extensive, comprehensive and often ambiguous regulatory requirements, violations during natural resource extraction operations are not unusual and, notwithstanding compliance efforts, we do not believe violations can be eliminated entirely. 

While it is not possible to quantify the costs of compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, those costs have been and are expected to continue to be significant. Our lessees in our coal and aggregates royalty businesses are required to post performance bonds pursuant to federal and state mining laws and regulations for the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closures, including the cost of treating mine water discharge when necessary. In many states our lessees also pay taxes into reclamation funds that states use to achieve reclamation where site specific performance bonds are inadequate to do so. Determinations by federal or state agencies that site specific bonds or state reclamation funds are inadequate could result in increased bonding costs for our lessees or even a cessation of operations if adequate levels of bonding cannot be maintained. We do not accrue for reclamation costs because our lessees are both contractually liable and liable under the permits they hold for all costs relating to their mining operations, including the costs of reclamation and mine closures. Although the lessees typically accrue adequate amounts for these costs, their future operating results would be adversely affected if they later determined these accruals to be insufficient. In recent years, compliance with these laws and regulations has substantially increased the cost of coal mining for all domestic coal producers 

In addition, the electric utility industry, which is the most significant end-user of steam coal, is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities, which has affected and is expected to continue to affect demand for coal mined from our properties. Current and future proposed legislation and regulations could be adopted that will have a significant additional impact on the mining operations of our lessees or their customers&#8217; ability to use coal and may require our lessees or their customers to change operations significantly or incur additional substantial costs that would negatively impact the coal industry. 

Many of the statutes discussed below also apply to exploration and development activities associated with our interests in crude oil and natural gas properties and to the aggregates and industrial mineral mining operations in which we hold interests, including VantaCore&#8217;s construction aggregates mining and production operations and Ciner Wyoming&#8217;s trona mining and soda ash production operations, and therefore we do not present a separate discussion of statutes related to those activities, except where appropriate. 

Air Emissions 

The Clean Air Act and corresponding state and local laws and regulations affect all aspects of our business. The Clean Air Act directly impacts our lessees&#8217; coal mining and processing operations by imposing permitting requirements and, in some cases, requirements to install certain emissions control equipment, on sources that emit various hazardous and non-hazardous air pollutants. The Clean Air Act also indirectly affects coal mining operations by extensively regulating the air emissions of coal-fired electric power generating plants. There have been a series of federal rulemakings that are focused on emissions from coal-fired electric generating facilities, including the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), regulating emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide, and the Mercury and Air Toxics Rule (MATS), regulating emissions of hazardous air pollutants. Installation of additional emissions control technologies and other measures required under these and other U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, including EPA&#8217;s proposed rules to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants, will make it more costly to operate coal-fired power plants and could make coal a less attractive or even effectively prohibited fuel source in the planning, building and operation of power plants in the future. These rules and regulations have resulted in a reduction in coal&#8217;s share of power generating capacity, which has negatively impacted our lessees&#8217; ability to sell coal 

and our coal-related revenues. Further reductions in coal&#8217;s share of power generating capacity as a result of compliance with existing or proposed rules and regulations would have a material adverse effect on our coal-related revenues. 

The emission of air pollutants from the exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas is also subject to the Clean Air Act and comparable state laws. In 2012, EPA published final New Source Performance Standards for volatile organic compounds and sulfur dioxide and National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants associated with oil and gas facilities. In January 2013, EPA granted petitions asking the agency to reconsider and revise parts of this rule. Accordingly, in September 2013, EPA issued updates to the New Source Performance Standards for the emission of volatile organic compounds from storage vessels used in crude oil and natural gas production. Similarly, in December 2014, EPA finalized rules related to emissions from gas and liquids during well completion. These rules could have an adverse effect on revenues from our interests in oil and natural gas properties. 

Carbon Dioxide and Greenhouse Gas Emissions 

In December 2009, EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other GHGs, present an endangerment to public health and welfare because emissions of such gases are, according to EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on its findings, EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under various provisions of the Clean Air Act. 

In August 2015, EPA published its final Clean Power Plan Rule, a multi-factor plan designed to cut carbon pollution from existing power plants, including coal-fired power plants. The rule requires improving the heat rate of existing coal-fired power plants and substituting lower carbon-emission sources like natural gas and renewables in place of coal. The rule will force many existing coal-fired power plants to incur substantial costs in order to comply or alternatively result in the closure of some of these plants. This rule is expected to have a material adverse effect on the demand for coal by electric power generators and is being challenged by industry participants and other parties in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In February 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States stayed the Clean Power Plan Rule pending a decision by the District of Columbia Circuit as well as any subsequent review by the Supreme Court. 

In October 2015, EPA published its final rule on performance standards for greenhouse gas emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed electric generating units. The final rule requires new steam generating units to use highly efficient supercritical pulverized coal boilers that use partial post-combustion carbon capture and storage technology. The final emission standard is less stringent than EPA had originally proposed due to updated cost assumptions, but could still have a material adverse effect on new coal-fired power plants. 

President Obama also announced an emission reduction deal with China&#8217;s President Xi Jinping in November 2014. The United States pledged that by 2025 it would cut climate pollution by 26 to 28% from 2005 levels. China pledged it would reach its peak carbon dioxide emissions around 2030 or earlier, and increase its non-fossil fuel share of energy to around 20% by 2030. In December 2015, the United States was one of 196 countries that participated in the Paris Climate Conference, at which the participants agreed to limit their emissions in order to limit global warming to 2 &#176; C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspirational goal of 1.5 &#176; C. While there is no way to estimate the impact of these climate pledges and agreements, they could ultimately have an adverse effect on the demand for coal, both nationally and internationally. 

EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States, including coal-fired electric power plants, on an annual basis, as well as certain oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis. 

In August 2015, EPA proposed new regulations to reduce emissions of methane from crude oil and natural gas production and transportation activities such as wells, pipelines, and valves levels by up to 45 percent by 2025 (compared to 2012 levels). A final rule is expected in 2016. 

Hazardous Materials and Waste 

The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or the Superfund law) and analogous state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. We could become liable under federal and state Superfund and waste management statutes if our lessees are unable to pay environmental cleanup costs 

relating to hazardous substances. In addition, we may have liability for environmental clean-up costs in connection with our VantaCore construction aggregates and Ciner Wyoming soda ash businesses and in connection with our non-operated working interests in oil and gas properties, to the extent of our proportionate interest therein. 

Water Discharges 

Operations conducted on our properties can result in discharges of pollutants into waters. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations create two permitting programs for mining operations. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program under Section 402 of the statute is administered by the states or EPA and regulates the concentrations of pollutants in discharges of waste and storm water from a mine site. The Section 404 program is administered by the Army Corps of Engineers and regulates the placement of overburden and fill material into channels, streams and wetlands that comprise "waters of the United States." The scope of waters that may fall within the jurisdictional reach of the Clean Water Act is expansive and may include land features not commonly understood to be a stream or wetlands. In June 2015, EPA issued a new rule defining the scope of "Waters of the United States" (WOTUS) that are subject to regulation. The WOTUS rule has been challenged by a number of states and private parties and was stayed on a nationwide basis by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in October 2015. The Clean Water Act and its regulations prohibit the unpermitted discharge of pollutants into such waters, including those from a spill or leak. Similarly, Section 404 also prohibits discharges of fill material and certain other activities in waters unless authorized by the issued permit. 

In connection with EPA&#8217;s review of permits, it has sought to reduce the size of fills and to impose limits on specific conductance (conductivity) and sulfate at levels that can be unachievable absent treatment at many mines. Such actions by EPA could make it more difficult or expensive to obtain or comply with such permits, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on our coal-related revenues. 

In addition to government action, private citizens&#8217; groups have continued to be active in bringing lawsuits against operators and landowners. Since 2012, several citizen suit group lawsuits have been filed against mine operators for allegedly violating conditions in their NPDES permits requiring compliance with West Virginia&#8217;s water quality standards. Some of the lawsuits allege violations of water quality standards for selenium, whereas others allege that discharges of conductivity and sulfate are causing violations of West Virginia&#8217;s narrative water quality standards, which generally prohibit adverse effects to aquatic life. The citizen suit groups have sought penalties as well as injunctive relief that would limit future discharges of selenium, conductivity or sulfate. The federal district court for the Southern District of West Virginia has ruled in favor of the citizen suit groups in multiple suits alleging violations of the water quality standard for selenium and in two suits alleging violations of water quality standards due to discharges of conductivity. Most of these cases were resolved prior to any appeal and it is difficult to predict whether such suits will continue to be successful. However, additional rulings requiring operators to reduce their discharges of selenium, conductivity or sulfate could result in large treatment expenses for our lessees. 

Since 2013, several citizen group lawsuits have been filed against landowners alleging ongoing discharges of pollutants, including selenium and conductivity, from valley fills located at reclaimed mountaintop removal mining sites in West Virginia. NRP has been named as a defendant in one of these lawsuits. In each case, the mine on the subject property has been closed, the property has been reclaimed, and the state reclamation bond has been released. While it is too early to determine the merits or predict the outcome of any of these lawsuits, any determination that a landowner or lessee has liability for discharges from a previously reclaimed mine site could result in substantial compliance costs or fines and would result in uncertainty as to continuing liability for completed and reclaimed coal mine operations. 

Drilling and development activities associated with our oil and natural gas business generate produced water. Produced water is often disposed of in underground injection control ("UIC") wells that receive permits from EPA or from state agencies that have been granted authority to issue UIC issue permits by EPA. Failures or delays in getting such permits could negatively impact exploration and production activities and, in turn, adversely affect our oil and natural gas business. 

Other Regulations Affecting the Mining Industry 

Mine Health and Safety Laws 

The operations of our lessees, VantaCore and Ciner Wyoming are subject to stringent health and safety standards that have been imposed by federal legislation since the adoption of the Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969. The Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 resulted in increased operating costs and reduced productivity. The Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, which 

significantly expanded the enforcement of health and safety standards of the Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, imposes comprehensive health and safety standards on all mining operations. In addition, the Black Lung Acts require payments of benefits by all businesses conducting current mining operations to coal miners with black lung or pneumoconiosis and to some beneficiaries of miners who have died from this disease. 

Mining accidents in recent years have received national attention and instigated responses at the state and national level that have resulted in increased scrutiny of current safety practices and procedures at all mining operations, particularly underground mining operations. Since 2006, heightened scrutiny has been applied to the safe operations of both underground and surface mines. This increased level of review has resulted in an increase in the civil penalties that mine operators have been assessed for non-compliance. Operating companies and their supervisory employees have also been subject to criminal convictions. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) has also advised mine operators that it will be more aggressive in placing mines in the Pattern of Violations program, if a mine&#8217;s rate of injuries or significant and substantial citations exceed a certain threshold. A mine that is placed in a Pattern of Violations program will receive additional scrutiny from MSHA. 

Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 

The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) and similar statutes enacted and enforced by the states impose on mine operators the responsibility of reclaiming the land and compensating the landowner for types of damages occurring as a result of mining operations. To ensure compliance with any reclamation obligations, mine operators are required to post performance bonds. Our coal lessees are contractually obligated under the terms of our leases to comply with all federal, state and local laws, including SMCRA. Upon completion of the mining, reclamation generally is completed by seeding with grasses or planting trees for use as pasture or timberland, as specified in the reclamation plan approved by the state regulatory authority. In addition, higher and better uses of the reclaimed property are encouraged. Regulatory authorities or individual citizens who bring civil actions under SMCRA may attempt to assign the liabilities of our coal lessees to us if any of these lessees are not financially capable of fulfilling those obligations. 

Mining Permits and Approvals 

Numerous governmental permits or approvals such as those required by SMCRA and the Clean Water Act are required for mining operations. In connection with obtaining these permits and approvals, our lessees may be required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed production of coal may have upon the environment. The requirements imposed by any of these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of mining operations. 

In order to obtain mining permits and approvals from state regulatory authorities, mine operators, including our lessees, must submit a reclamation plan for reclaiming the mined property upon the completion of mining operations. Our lessees have obtained or applied for permits to mine a majority of the reserves that are currently planned to be mined over the next five years. Our lessees are also in the planning phase for obtaining permits for the additional reserves planned to be mined over the following five years. However, given the imposition of new requirements in the permits in the form of policies and the increased oversight review that has been exercised by EPA, there are no assurances that they will not experience difficulty and delays in obtaining mining permits in the future. In addition, EPA has used its authority to create significant delays in the issuance of new permits and the modification of existing permits, which has led to substantial delays and increased costs for coal operators. 

Regulations under SMCRA include a "stream buffer zone" rule that prohibits certain mining activities near streams. In 2008, the federal Office of Surface Mining (OSM), which implements SMCRA, revised the stream buffer zone rule, making it more clear that valley fills are not prohibited by the rule. Environmental groups challenged the revision to the buffer zone rule in federal court. In February 2014, the federal court vacated the 2008 rule and in December 2014, OSM reinstated the previous version of the rule, without clarifying whether the previous version of the rule impacts the ability to construct excess fills. OSM has stated that it is considering future revisions to the buffer zone rule. Any revision or interpretation of the rule limiting or prohibiting valley fills could restrict our lessees&#8217; ability to develop new mines, or could require our lessees to modify existing operations, which could have an adverse effect on our coal-related revenues. 

In April 2013, in Mingo Logan Coal Company v. EPA , the D.C. Circuit Court ruled that EPA has the authority under the Clean Water Act to retroactively veto a Section 404 dredge and fill permit issued at a coal mine by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The decision creates uncertainties for all companies operating with Clean Water Act fill permits and their business partners. While 

the specific facts of this case relate to ongoing fill activities, the broadly written language of the decision could have sweeping implications in other areas and result in increased regulatory activity by EPA that is adverse to the mining industry. 

Other Regulations Affecting the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry 

Hydraulic Fracturing 

The exploration and production companies that operate the crude oil and natural gas properties in which we have interests use hydraulic fracturing to recover oil and natural gas from tight rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing is a process customary to the oil and gas industry in which water, sand and other additives are pumped under high pressure into tight rock formations in a manner that creates or expands fractures in the rock to facilitate oil and gas recovery. While hydraulic fracturing has been used to recover oil and natural gas for decades, the practice has recently received increased scrutiny from various federal, state and local agencies, some of which have prohibited the practice or called for further study of its effects. Future requirements that limit or more strictly regulate the permitting or use of hydraulic fracturing could impact revenues from our oil and natural gas properties. 

Permitting 

Additionally, state agencies are generally charged with issuing permits governing the location and construction of drilling sites. Delays or failures to obtain such permits due to local land use or environmental concerns could negatively impact revenues from our oil and gas operations. 

Transportation 

Our revenues could be negatively impacted if the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which approves interstate pipelines and certain gathering lines, fails to timely approve pipelines that transport oil or natural gas produced from the properties in which we own interests. Additionally, our oil and natural gas revenues could be negatively impacted by rules proposed in July 2014 by the United States Department of Transportation governing the transportation of crude oil by rail. As proposed, the rules would require thousands of railroad tank cars to be upgraded or phased out by 2017. Railroad tank car shortages resulting from the proposed rule could delay or increase the costs of transportation of crude oil from our Williston Basin non-operated working interests and negatively impact revenues from those properties. 

Employees and Labor Relations 

We historically have not had any employees. To carry out our operations, affiliates of our general partner employ 88 people who directly support our operations. None of these employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. As a result of our acquisition of VantaCore in the fourth quarter of 2014, we employ 225 people who support VantaCore&#8217;s construction aggregates mining and production operations. None of these employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
