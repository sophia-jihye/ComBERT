Recent Developments 

&#160; 

Cloudweb, Inc., formerly known as Formigli Inc., was a company in the development stages that planned to engage in the worldwide distribution of custom handmade Italian road bikes, made by Renzo Formigli. Amy Chaffe, who was the President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, founded the Company. 

The Company and Ms. Chaffe decided to conduct a corporate restructuring. On December 3, 2015, Mr. Renzo Formigli resigned as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. 

On the same day, the Company filed Articles of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Florida Department of State whereby it amended its Articles of Incorporation by (i) changing its name to &#8220;Cloudweb, Inc.&#8221;, (ii) increasing the Company&#8217;s authorized number of shares of common stock from 100 million to 500 million, and (iii) increasing the Company&#8217;s total issued and outstanding shares of common stock by conducting a forward split of such shares at the rate of 100 shares for every one (1) share currently issued and outstanding (the &#8220;Forward Split&#8221;). 

The Company then filed an Issuer Company-Related Action Notification Form with FINRA requesting that the name change be effected in the market. It also requested that its ticker symbol be changed to &#8220;CLOU&#8221;. 

Amy Chaffe, the Company&#8217;s President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and sole member of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, executed an agreement whereby an aggregate of 7,500,000 shares of Company common stock owned by her would be cancelled without any remuneration, leaving Ms. Chaffe owning 2,500,000 shares of Company common stock after such cancellation and prior to the Forward Split. 

On January 28, 2016, a change in control of Cloudweb Inc. (the "Company") occurred by virtue of the Company's largest shareholder Amy Chaffe selling all of the shares of the Company's common stock that she owned, which was in the amount of 250,000,000 shares, to certain third party investors. Such shares sold by Ms. Chaffe represented 80% of the Company's total issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As part of the sale of the shares, the purchaser of such shares, Mr. Zhi De Liao, arranged with Ms. Chaffe his appointment to the Company's Board of Directors and as an executive officer of the Company. Immediately thereafter, Ms. Chaffe resigned as a member of the Board. Mr. Zhi De Liao is Cloudweb&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, and a member of Cloudweb&#8217;s Board of Directors. 

Cloudweb then completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Data Cloud from Mr. Liao pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement. As a result of the completion of this acquisition, 2,500,000 shares of Cloudweb&#8217;s common stock were issued to Mr. Liao. Mr. Liao now hold 81% of the Company&#8217;s total issued and outstanding shares of common stock. 

Data Cloud owns 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Web Hosting Solutions Ltd (&#8220;WHS&#8221;), which it purchased from James Holland for GBP 47,000. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Data Cloud agreed to employ Mr. Holland to continue management and operations of WHS during the period of his employment and appoint Mr. Holland to its Board of Directors. WHS has been providing web hosting solutions for approximately ten (10) years and became a UK private limited company in 2012. In connection with the Share Exchange Agreement, Cloudweb elected to enter into the web hosting industry.
