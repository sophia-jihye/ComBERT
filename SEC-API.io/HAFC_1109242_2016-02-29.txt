 Item 1. Business 

General 

Hanmi Financial Corporation (&#8220;Hanmi Financial,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) is a Delaware corporation incorporated on March 14, 2000 to be the holding company for Hanmi Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;) and is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHCA&#8221;). Hanmi Financial also elected financial holding company status under the BHCA in 2000. Our principal office is located at 3660 Wilshire Boulevard, Penthouse Suite A, Los Angeles, California 90010, and our telephone number is (213) 382-2200. 

Hanmi Bank, the primary subsidiary of Hanmi Financial, is a state chartered bank incorporated under the laws of the State of California on August 24, 1981, and licensed pursuant to the California Financial Code (&#8220;Financial Code&#8221;) on December 15, 1982. The Bank&#8217;s deposit accounts are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (&#8220;FDIA&#8221;) up to applicable limits thereof, and the Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System. The Bank&#8217;s headquarters is located at 3660 Wilshire Boulevard, Penthouse Suite A, Los Angeles, California 90010. 

The Bank is a community bank conducting general business banking, with its primary market encompassing the Korean-American community as well as other ethnic communities across California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Texas, Virginia and Washington. The Bank&#8217;s full-service offices are located in markets where many of the businesses are run by immigrants and other minority groups. The Bank&#8217;s client base reflects the multi-ethnic composition of these communities. 

Hanmi Financial sold their insurance subsidiaries, Chun-Ha Insurance Services, Inc. (&#8220;Chun-Ha&#8221;) and All World Insurance Services, Inc. (&#8220;All World&#8221;), to Chunha Holding Corporation on June 30, 2014. Total assets and net asset of Chun-Ha and All World were $5.6 million and $3.3 million, respectively. The total sales price was $3.5 million, of which $2.0 million was paid upon signing. See &#8220;Note 4&#8212;Sale of Insurance Subsidiaries and Discontinued Operations.&#8221; 

On August 31, 2014, Hanmi Financial completed its acquisition of Central Bancorp Inc., a Texas corporation (&#8220;CBI&#8221;), the parent company of United Central Bank (&#8220;UCB&#8221;). In the merger with CBI, each share of CBI common stock was exchanged for $17.64 per share or $50 million in the aggregate. In addition, Hanmi Financial paid $28.7 million to redeem CBI preferred stock immediately prior to the consummation of the merger. The merger consideration was funded from consolidated cash of Hanmi Financial. At August 31, 2014, CBI had total assets, liabilities and equity of $1.27 billion, $1.17 billion and $93.3 million, respectively. Total loans and deposits were $297.3 million and $1.10 billion, respectively, at August 31, 2014. The Company recorded a $14.6 million bargain purchase gain related to this transaction. See &#8220;Note 2 &#8212; Acquisition.&#8221; The Company had no acquisitions during 2015. 

The Bank&#8217;s revenues are derived primarily from interest and fees on loans, interest and dividends on securities portfolio, and service charges on deposit accounts, as well as a bargain purchase gain in 2014. A summary of revenues for the periods indicated follows:

Market Area 

The Bank historically has provided its banking services through its branch network to a wide variety of small- to medium-sized businesses. Throughout the Bank&#8217;s service areas, competition is intense for both loans and deposits. While the market for banking services is dominated by a few nationwide banks with many offices operating over wide geographic areas, the Bank&#8217;s primary competitors are relatively larger and smaller community banks that focus their marketing efforts on Korean-American businesses in the Bank&#8217;s service areas. With the acquisition of CBI during 2014, the Bank expanded its market share from our core Korean American customer base to the wider Asian American and mainstream communities primarily in Illinois and Texas. 

Lending Activities 

The Bank originates loans for its own portfolio and for sale in the secondary market. Lending activities include real estate loans (commercial property, construction and residential property), commercial and industrial loans (commercial term, commercial lines of credit and international), consumer loans and SBA loans. 

Real Estate Loans 

Real estate lending involves risks associated with the potential decline in the value of the underlying real estate collateral and the cash flow from income-producing properties. Declines in real estate values and cash flows can be caused by a number of factors, including adversity in general economic conditions, rising interest rates, changes in tax and other laws and regulations affecting the holding of real estate, environmental conditions, governmental and other use restrictions, development of competitive properties and increasing vacancy rates. When real estate values decline, the Bank&#8217;s real estate dependence increases the risk of loss both in the Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio and the Bank&#8217;s holdings of other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;),which are the result of foreclosures on real property due to default by borrowers who use the property as collateral for loans. OREO properties are categorized as real property that is owned by the Bank but which is not directly related to the Bank&#8217;s business. 

Commercial Property 

The Bank offers commercial real estate loans, which are usually collateralized by first deeds of trust. The Bank generally obtains formal appraisals in accordance with applicable regulations to support the value of the real estate collateral. All appraisal reports on commercial mortgage loans are reviewed by an appraisal review officer. The review generally covers an examination of the appraiser&#8217;s assumptions and methods that were used to derive a value for the property, as well as compliance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (&#8220;USPAP&#8221;). The Bank determines credit worthiness of a borrower by evaluating cash flow ability, asset and debt structure, as well as the credit history. The purpose of the loan is also an important consideration that dictates loan structure and credit decision. 

The Bank&#8217;s commercial real estate loans are principally secured by investor-owned or owner-occupied commercial and industrial buildings. Generally, these types of loans are made with a maturity date of up to seven years based on longer amortization periods. Typically, the Bank's commercial real estate loans have a debt-coverage-ratio at time of origination of 1.25 or more and a loan-to-value ratio of 70 percent or less. In addition, the Bank generally seeks an adjustable rate of interest indexed to the prime rate appearing in the West Coast edition of The Wall Street Journal &#32;(&#8220;WSJ Prime Rate&#8221;) or the Bank&#8217;s prime rate (&#8220;Bank Prime Rate&#8221;), as adjusted from time to time. The Bank also offers fixed-rate commercial real estate loans, including hybrid-fixed rate loans that are fixed for one to five years and then convert to adjustable rate loans for the remaining term. Amortization schedules for commercial real estate loans generally do not exceed 25 years. 

Payments on loans secured by investor-owned and owner-occupied properties are often dependent upon successful operation or management of the properties. Repayment of such loans may be subject to the risk from adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. The Bank seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, including limiting the size of such loans in relation to the market value of the property and strictly scrutinizing the property securing the loan. At the time of loan origination a sensitivity analysis is performed for potential increases to vacancy and interest rates to stress adverse conditions. Additionally, a quarterly risk assessment is also performed for the commercial real estate secured loan portfolio, which involves evaluating recent industry trends. When possible, the Bank also obtains corporate or individual guarantees. Representatives of the Bank conduct site visits of most properties securing the Bank&#8217;s real estate loans before the loans are approved. 

The Bank generally requires the borrower to provide, at least annually, current cash flow information in order for the Bank to re-assess the debt-coverage-ratio. In addition, the Bank requires title insurance to insure the status of its lien on all of the real estate secured loans when a trust deed on the real estate is taken as collateral. The Bank also requires the borrower to maintain fire insurance, extended coverage casualty insurance and, if the property is in a flood zone, flood insurance, in an amount equal to the outstanding loan balance, subject to applicable laws that may limit the amount of hazard insurance a lender 

can require to replace such improvements. We cannot assure that these procedures will protect against losses on loans secured by real property. 

Construction 

The Bank finances a small portfolio of construction of multifamily, low-income housing, commercial and industrial properties within its market area. The future condition of the local economy could negatively affect the collateral values of such loans. The Bank&#8217;s construction loans typically have the following structure: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

maturities of two years or less; 

&#8226; 

a floating rate of interest based on the Bank Prime Rate or the WSJ Prime Rate; 

&#8226; 

minimum cash equity of 35 percent of project cost; 

&#8226; 

reserve of anticipated interest costs during construction or advance of fees; 

&#8226; 

first lien position on the underlying real estate; 

&#8226; 

loan-to-value ratios at time of origination that do not exceed 65 percent; and 

&#8226; 

recourse against the borrower or a guarantor in the event of default. 

On a case-by-case basis, the Bank does commit to making permanent loans on the property under loan conditions that require strong project stability and debt service coverage. Construction loans involve additional risks compared to loans secured by existing improved real property. Such risks include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

the uncertain value of the project prior to completion; 

&#8226; 

the inherent uncertainty in estimating construction costs, which are often beyond the borrower&#8217;s control; 

&#8226; 

construction delays and cost overruns; 

&#8226; 

possible difficulties encountered in connection with municipal, state or other governmental ordinances or regulations during construction; and 

&#8226; 

the difficulty in accurately evaluating the market value of the completed project. 

Because of these uncertainties, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds where repayment of the loan is dependent, in part, on the success of the final project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest on the loan. If the Bank is forced to foreclose on a construction project prior to or at completion due to a default under the terms of a loan, there can be no assurance that the Bank will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, or accrued interest on, the loan as well as the related foreclosure and holding costs. In addition, the Bank may be required to fund additional amounts in order to complete a pending construction project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminable period of time. The Bank has underwriting procedures designed to identify factors that it believes to be acceptable levels of risk in construction lending, including, among other procedures, engaging qualified and bonded third parties to provide progress reports and recommendations for construction loan disbursements. No assurance can be given that these procedures will prevent losses arising from the risks associated with construction loans described above. 

Residential Property 

The Bank originates and purchases fixed-rate and variable-rate mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family properties with amortization schedules of 15 to 30 years and maturity schedules of up to 30 years. The loan fees, interest rates and other provisions of the Bank&#8217;s residential loans are determined by an analysis of the Bank&#8217;s cost of funds, cost of origination, cost of servicing, risk factors and portfolio needs. 

The Bank may sell some of the mortgage loans that it originates to secondary market participants. The average turn-around time from origination of a mortgage loan to its sale to a secondary market participant ranges from 30 to 90 days. The interest rate and the price of the loan are typically agreed upon between the Bank and the secondary market purchaser prior to the origination of the loan. 

Commercial and Industrial Loans 

The Bank offers commercial loans for intermediate and short-term credit. Commercial loans may be unsecured, partially secured or fully secured. The majority of the commercial loans that the Bank originates are for business located primarily in California, Illinois and Texas, and the maturity schedules range from 12 to 60 months. The Bank finances primarily small- and 

middle-market businesses in a wide spectrum of industries. Commercial and industrial loans consist of credit lines for operating needs, loans for equipment purchases and working capital, and various other business purposes. The Bank requires credit underwriting before considering any extension of credit. 

Commercial lending entails significant risks. Commercial lending loans typically involve larger loan balances, are generally dependent on the cash flow of the business and may be subject to adverse conditions in the general economy or in a specific industry. Short-term business loans are customarily intended to finance current operations and typically provide for principal payment at maturity, with interest payable monthly. Term loans typically provide for floating interest rates, with monthly payments of both principal and interest. 

In general, it is the intent of the Bank to take collateral whenever possible, regardless of the loan purpose(s). Collateral may include, but is not limited to, liens on inventory, accounts receivable, fixtures and equipment, leasehold improvements and real estate. Where real estate is the primary collateral, the Bank obtains formal appraisals in accordance with applicable regulations to support the value of the real estate collateral. Typically, the Bank requires all principals of a business to be co-obligors on all loan instruments and all significant stockholders of corporations to execute a specific debt guaranty. All borrowers must demonstrate the ability to service and repay not only their obligations to the Bank, but also any and all outstanding business debt, without liquidating the collateral, based on historical earnings or reliable projections. 

Commercial Term 

The Bank offers term loans for a variety of needs, including loans for working capital, purchases of equipment, machinery or inventory, business acquisitions, renovation of facilities, and refinancing of existing business-related debts. These loans have repayment terms of up to seven years. 

Commercial Lines of Credit 

The Bank offers lines of credit for a variety of short-term needs, including lines of credit for working capital, accounts receivable and inventory financing, and other purposes related to business operations. Commercial lines of credit usually have a term of 12 months or less. 

International 

The Bank offers a variety of international finance and trade services and products, including letters of credit, import financing (trust receipt financing and bankers&#8217; acceptances) and export financing. Although most of our trade finance activities are related to trade with Asian countries, all of our loans are made to companies domiciled in the United States, and a substantial portion of those borrowers are California-based businesses engaged in import and export activities. 

Consumer Loans 

Consumer loans are extended for a variety of purposes, including automobile loans, secured and unsecured personal loans, home improvement loans, home equity lines of credit, unsecured lines of credit and credit cards. Management assesses the borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness and ability to repay the debt through a review of credit history and ratings, verification of employment and other income, review of debt-to-income ratios and other measures of repayment ability. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary importance, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount. Most of the Bank&#8217;s loans to individual consumers are repayable on an installment basis. 

SBA Loans 

The Bank originates loans (&#8220;SBA loans&#8221;) that are guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;), an independent agency of the federal government. SBA loans are offered for business purposes such as owner-occupied commercial real estate, business acquisitions, start-ups, franchise financing, working capital, improvements and renovations, inventory and equipment and debt-refinancing. SBA loans offer lower down payments and longer term financing which helps small business that are starting out, or about to expand. The guarantees on SBA loans currently range from 75 percent to 85 percent of the principal amount of the loan. The Bank typically requires that SBA loans be secured by business assets and by a first or second deed of trust on any available real property. When the SBA loan is secured by a first deed of trust on real property, the Bank generally obtains appraisals in accordance with applicable regulations. SBA loans have terms ranging from 5 to 25 years depending on the use of the proceeds. To qualify for a SBA loan, a borrower must demonstrate the capacity to service and repay the loan, without liquidating the collateral, based on historical earnings or reliable projections. 

The Bank normally sells to unrelated third parties a substantial amount of the guaranteed portion of the SBA loans that it originates. When the Bank sells a SBA loan, it has an option to repurchase the loan if the loan defaults. If the Bank repurchases a loan, the Bank will make a demand for guarantee purchase to the SBA. Even after the sale of an SBA loan, the Bank retains the right to service the SBA loan and to receive servicing fees. The unsold portions of the SBA loans that remain owned by the Bank are included in loans receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2015 , the Bank had $195.2 million of SBA loans in its loan portfolio, and was servicing $474 million of SBA loans sold to investors. 

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments 

As part of the suite of services available to its small- to medium-sized business customers, the Bank from time to time issues formal commitments and lines of credit. These commitments can be either secured or unsecured. They may be in the form of revolving lines of credit for seasonal working capital needs or may take the form of commercial letters of credit or standby letters of credit. Commercial letters of credit facilitate import trade. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. 

Lending Procedures and Loan Limits 

Individual lending authority is granted to the Chief Credit Officer and certain additional designated officers. Loans for which direct and indirect borrower liability exceeds an individual&#8217;s lending authority are referred to the Bank&#8217;s Management Credit Committee and, for those in excess of the Management Credit Committee&#8217;s approval limits, to the Loan and Credit Policy Committee. 

Legal lending limits are calculated in conformance with the California Financial Code, which prohibits a bank from lending to any one individual or entity or its related interests on an unsecured basis any amount that exceeds 15 percent of the sum of such bank&#8217;s stockholders&#8217; equity plus the allowance for loan losses, capital notes and any debentures, plus an additional 10 percent on a secured basis. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank&#8217;s authorized legal lending limits for loans to one borrower were $74.5 million for unsecured loans plus an additional $49.7 million for specific secured loans. 

The Bank seeks to mitigate the risks inherent in its loan portfolio by adhering to certain underwriting practices. The review of each loan application includes analysis of the applicant&#8217;s experience, prior credit history, income level, cash flow, financial condition, tax returns, cash flow projections, and the value of any collateral to secure the loan, based upon reports of independent appraisers and/or audits of accounts receivable or inventory pledged as security. In the case of real estate loans over a specified threshold, the review of collateral value includes an appraisal report prepared by an independent Bank-approved appraiser. All appraisal reports on commercial real property secured loans are reviewed by an appraisal review officer. The review generally covers an examination of the appraiser&#8217;s assumptions and methods that were used to derive a value for the property, as well as compliance with the USPAP. 

Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowance for Off-Balance Sheet Items and Provision for Credit Losses 

The Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level considered by management to be adequate to cover the inherent risks of loss associated with its loan portfolio under prevailing economic conditions. In addition, the Bank maintains an allowance for off-balance sheet items associated with unfunded commitments and letters of credit, which is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

The Bank assesses its allowance for loan losses for adequacy on a quarterly basis. The California Department of Business Oversight (&#8220;DBO&#8221;), formerly known as the California Department of Financial Institutions, and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (&#8220;FRB&#8221;) may require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses through a provision for loan losses based upon their assessment of the information available to them at the time of their examinations. 

Deposits 

The Bank offers a traditional array of deposit products, including noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking and savings accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal (&#8220;NOW&#8221;) accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. These accounts, except for noninterest-bearing checking accounts, earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and management&#8217;s desire to increase certain types or maturities of deposit liabilities. Our approach is to tailor fit products and bundle those that meet the customer&#8217;s needs. This approach is designed to add value for the customer, increase products per household and produce higher service fee income. 

Available Information 

We file reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;), including our Proxy Statements, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments thereto. These reports and other information on file can be inspected and copied at the public reference facilities of the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington D.C., 20549 on official business days during the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains a website that contains the reports, proxy and information statements and other information we file with them. The address of the site is www.sec.gov . 

We also maintain an Internet website at www.hanmi.com . We make available free of charge through our website our Proxy Statements, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments thereto, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such reports with the SEC. We make our website content available for information purposes only. It should not be relied upon for investment purposes. None of the information contained in or hyperlinked from our website is incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Bank had a total of 609 full-time employees and 13 part-time employees. None of the employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The management of the Bank believes that their employee relations are satisfactory. 

Insurance 

We maintain directors and officers, financial institution bond and commercial insurance at levels deemed adequate by management to protect Hanmi Financial from certain litigation and other losses. 

Competition 

The banking and financial services industry in each state we are located generally, and in the Bank&#8217;s market areas specifically, are highly competitive. The increasingly competitive environment faced by banks is primarily the result of changes in laws and regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, new competitors in the market, and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. We compete for loans, deposits and customers with other commercial banks, savings institutions, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, real estate investment trusts, insurance companies, finance companies, money market funds, credit unions and other non-bank financial service providers. Some of these competitors are larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets, including foreign-ownership, and/or offer a broader range of financial services. 

Many of our competitors are larger financial institutions that offer some services, such as more extensive and established branch networks and trust services, which the Bank does not provide. 

Other institutions, including brokerage firms, credit card companies and retail establishments, offer banking services and products to consumers that are in direct competition with the Bank, including money market funds with check access and cash advances on credit card accounts. In addition, many non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal or state regulations that govern bank holding companies and federally insured banks. 

The Bank&#8217;s direct competitors are community banks that focus their marketing efforts on Korean-American, Asian-American and immigrant-owned businesses, while offering the same or similar services and products as those offered by the Bank. These banks compete for loans and deposits primarily through the interest rates and fees they charge and the convenience and quality of service they provide to customers. 

Economic, Legislative and Regulatory Developments 

Future profitability, like that of most financial institutions, is primarily dependent on interest rate differentials and credit quality. In general, the difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rates received by us on our interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to our customers and securities held in our investment portfolio, will comprise the major portion of our earnings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, such as inflation, recession and unemployment, and the impact that future changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions might have on us cannot be predicted. 

Our business is also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;), the federal government, and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the FRB. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policies (with objectives such as curbing inflation and combating recession) through its open-market operations in U.S. government securities, by adjusting the required level of reserves for depository institutions subject to its reserve requirements, and by varying the target federal funds and discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions. The actions of the Federal Reserve in these areas influence the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and affect interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The nature and impact on us of any future changes in monetary and fiscal policies cannot be predicted. 

From time to time, federal and state legislation is enacted that may have the effect of materially increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities, or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers, such as federal legislation permitting affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies and securities firms. We cannot predict whether or when any potential legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the outcome of any investigations initiated by state authorities or litigation raising issues may result in necessary changes in our operations, additional regulation and increased compliance costs. 

Regulation and Supervision 

(a) General 

The Company and the Bank are subject to significant regulation and restrictions by federal and state laws and regulatory agencies. These regulations and restrictions are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) and for the protection of borrowers, and secondarily for the stability of the U.S. banking system. The following discussion of statutes and regulations is a summary and does not purport to be complete nor does it address all applicable statutes and regulations. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations referred to in this discussion. From time to time, federal and state legislation is enacted and implemented by regulations which may have the effect of materially increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities, or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers. 

We cannot predict whether or when other legislation or new regulations may be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that new legislation or any implemented regulations and supervisory policies would have on our financial condition and results of operations. Such developments may further alter the structure, regulation, and competitive relationship among financial institutions, and may subject us to increased regulation, disclosure, and reporting requirements. 

(b) Legislation and Regulatory Developments 

The implementation and impact of legislation and regulations enacted since 2008 in response to the U.S. economic downturn and financial instability, continued in 2015 as a modest recovery returned to many institutions in the banking sector. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank, Act of 2010 ("Dodd-Frank" or "Dodd-Frank Act") are effective and have been fully implemented, including the revisions in the deposit insurance assessment base for FDIC insurance and the permanent increase in coverage to $250,000; the permissibility of paying interest on business checking accounts; the removal of barriers to interstate branching and required disclosure and shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation. Implementation in 2014 of additional Dodd-Frank regulatory provisions included aspects of (i) the final new capital rules and (ii) the so called Volcker Rule restrictions on certain proprietary trading and investment activities. 

In the exercise of their supervisory and examination authority, the regulatory agencies have emphasized corporate governance, stress testing, enterprise risk management and other board responsibilities; anti-money laundering compliance and enhanced high risk customer due diligence; vendor management; cyber security and fair lending and other consumer compliance obligations. 

(c) Capital Adequacy Requirements 

Bank holding companies and banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies. New capital rules described below were effective on January 1, 2014, and are being phased in over various periods (the &#8220;New Capital Rules&#8221;). The basic capital rule changes were fully effective on January 1, 2015, but many elements are being phased in over multiple future years. Capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations (See &#8220;Prompt Corrective Action Provisions&#8221; below), involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting, and other factors. The risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks require capital ratios that vary based on the perceived 

degree of risk associated with a banking organization&#8217;s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, such as loans, and those recorded as off-balance sheet items, such as commitments, letters of credit and recourse arrangements. The risk-based capital ratio is determined by classifying assets and certain off-balance sheet financial instruments into weighted categories, with higher levels of capital being required for those categories perceived as representing greater risks and dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance sheet items. Bank holding companies and banks engaged in significant trading activity may also be subject to the market risk capital guidelines and be required to incorporate additional market and interest rate risk components into their risk-based capital standards. To the extent that the new rules are not fully phased in, the prior capital rules continue to apply. 

Under the risk-based capital guidelines in place prior to the effectiveness of the New Capital Rules, there were three fundamental capital ratios: a total risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a Tier 1 leverage ratio. To be deemed &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; a bank must have a total risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least ten percent, six percent and five percent, respectively. Under the capital rules that applied in 2014, there was no Tier 1 leverage requirement for a holding company to be deemed well-capitalized. At December 31, 2015 , the Company and the Bank&#8217;s total risk-based capital ratios were 14.91% and 14.86%, respectively; their Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios were 13.65% and 13.60%, respectively; their Common equity tier 1 capital ratios were 13.65% and 13.60%, respectively, and the Company&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s leverage capital ratios were 11.31% and 11.27%, respectively, all of which ratios exceeded the minimum percentage requirements to be deemed &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; for regulatory purposes. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Capital Resources.&#8221; The federal banking agencies may require banks and bank holding companies subject to enforcement actions to maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum ratios otherwise required to be deemed well capitalized, in which case institutions may no longer be deemed to be well capitalized and may therefore be subject to restrictions on taking brokered deposits. 

(d) New Capital Rules and Minimum Capital Ratios 

The federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final regulations in July 2013, which revised their risk-based and leverage capital requirements for banking organizations to meet requirements of Dodd&#8211;Frank and to implement Basel III international agreements reached by the Basel Committee. Although many of the rules contained in these final regulations are applicable only to large, internationally active banks, some of them will apply on a phased in basis to all banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank. 

The following are among the new requirements that are phased in beginning January 1, 2015: &#160; 

&#8226; An increase in the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio from 4.00% to 6.00% of risk-weighted assets; 

&#8226; 

A new category and a required 4.50% of risk-weighted assets ratio is established for &#8220;common equity Tier 1&#8221; as a subset of Tier 1 capital limited to common equity; 

&#8226; 

A minimum non-risk-based leverage ratio is set at 4.00%, eliminating a 3.00% exception for higher rated banks; 

&#8226; 

Changes in the permitted composition of Tier 1 capital to exclude trust preferred securities, mortgage servicing rights and certain deferred tax assets and include unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities; 

&#8226; 

The risk-weights of certain assets for purposes of calculating the risk-based capital ratios are changed for high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans, certain past due non-residential mortgage loans and certain mortgage-backed and other securities exposures; 

&#8226; An additional &#8220;countercyclical capital buffer&#8221; is required for larger and more complex institutions; and 

&#8226; 

A new additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk weighted assets over each of the required capital ratios will be phased in from 2016 to 2019 and must be met to avoid limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses. 

Including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, the new final capital rule would result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, (ii) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. In January 2016, the new capital conservation buffer requirement started to phase in at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and would increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. While the new final capital rule sets higher regulatory capital standards for the Company and the Bank, bank regulators may also continue their past policies of expecting banks to maintain additional capital beyond the new minimum requirements. The implementation of the new capital rules or more stringent requirements to maintain higher levels of capital or to maintain higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s net income and return on equity, restrict the ability to pay dividends or executive bonuses and require the raising of additional capital. 

Management believes that, as of December 31, 2015 , the Company and the Bank would meet all applicable capital requirements under the New Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently in effect. 

(e) Final Volcker Rule 

Under the Volker Rule, and subject to certain exceptions, banking entities, including the Company and the Bank, will be restricted from engaging in activities that are considered proprietary trading and from sponsoring or investing in certain entities, including hedge or private equity funds that are considered &#8220;covered funds.&#8221; These rules became effective on April 1, 2014, although certain provisions are subject to delayed effectiveness under rules promulgated by the Federal Reserve. The Company and the Bank held no investment positions at December 31, 2015 which were subject to the final &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221;. Therefore, while these new rules may require us to conduct certain internal analysis and reporting, we believe that they will not require any material changes in our operations or business. 

(f) Bank Holding Company Regulation 

Bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are subject to significant regulation and restrictions by Federal and State laws and regulatory agencies, which may affect the cost of doing business, and may limit permissible activities and expansion or impact the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers. 

A wide range of requirements and restrictions are contained in both Federal and State banking laws, which together with implementing regulatory authority: 

Require periodic reports and such additional reports of information as the Federal Reserve may require; 

Require bank holding companies to meet or exceed increased levels of capital (See &#8220;Capital Adequacy Requirements&#8221; and &#8220;New Capital Rules and Minimum Capital Ratios&#8221; above); 

Require that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to subsidiary banks and commit resources as necessary to support each subsidiary bank. 

Limit dividends payable to shareholders and restricts the ability of bank holding companies to obtain dividends or other distributions from their subsidiary banks. The Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on both its common and preferred stock is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s funds to pay dividends or to pay principal and interest on our debt obligations are derived from dividends paid by the Bank; 

Require a bank holding company to terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries, affiliates or investments if the Federal Reserve believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary; 

Require the prior approval of senior executive officer or director changes and prohibit golden parachute payments, including change in control agreements, or new employment agreements with such payment terms, which are contingent upon termination if an institution is in &#8220;troubled condition&#8221;; 

Regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt, including the authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt and require prior approval to purchase or redeem securities in certain situations; and 

Require prior Federal agency approval of acquisitions and mergers with banks and consider certain competitive, management, financial, anti-money-laundering compliance, potential impact on U.S. financial stability or other factors in granting these approvals, in addition to similar California or other state banking agency approvals which may also be required. 

(g) Other Restrictions on the Company&#8217;s Activities 

Subject to prior notice or Federal Reserve approval, bank holding companies may generally engage in, or acquire shares of companies engaged in, activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank holding companies which elect and retain &#8220;financial holding company&#8221; status pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) may engage in these nonbanking activities and broader securities, insurance, merchant banking and other activities that are determined to be &#8220;financial in nature&#8221; or are incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature without prior Federal Reserve approval. Pursuant to GLBA and Dodd-Frank, in order to elect and retain financial holding company status, a bank holding company and all depository institution subsidiaries of a bank holding company must be considered well capitalized and well managed, and, except in limited circumstances, depository subsidiaries must be in satisfactory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;), which requires banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate. Failure to sustain compliance with these requirements or correct any non-compliance within a fixed time period could lead to divestiture of subsidiary banks or require all activities to conform to those permissible for a bank holding company. The Company has 

elected, and currently maintains, financial holding company status. Neither the Company nor the Bank has engaged in any activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. The Federal Reserve rated the Bank as &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; in meeting community credit needs under the CRA at its most recent examination for CRA performance. 

The Company is also a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 3700 of the California Financial Code. Therefore, the Company and any of its subsidiaries are subject to examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the California Department of Business Oversight (&#8220;DBO&#8221;). DBO approvals may also be required for certain mergers and acquisitions. 

(h) Bank Regulation 

As a California commercial bank whose deposits are insured by the FDIC, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision, and regular examination by the DBO and by the FRB, as the Bank&#8217;s primary Federal regulator, and must additionally comply with certain applicable regulations of the FDIC. Specific federal and state laws and regulations which are applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, their activities relating to dividends, investments, loans, the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans, servicing and foreclosing on loans, borrowings, capital requirements, certain check-clearing activities, branching, and mergers and acquisitions. California banks are also subject to statutes and regulations including Federal Reserve Regulation O and Federal Reserve Act Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation W, which restrict or limit loans or extensions of credit to &#8220;insiders&#8221;, including officers, directors, and principal shareholders, and loans or extension of credit by banks to affiliates or purchases of assets from affiliates, including parent bank holding companies, except pursuant to certain exceptions and only on terms and conditions at least as favorable to those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated parties. Dodd-Frank expanded definitions and restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders under Sections 23A and 23B and also lending limits for derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions 

Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (&#8220;FDI Act&#8221;) and the California Financial Code, California state chartered commercial banks may generally engage in any activity permissible for national banks. Therefore, the Bank may form subsidiaries to engage in the many so-called &#8220;closely related to banking&#8221; or &#8220;nonbanking&#8221; activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries or in subsidiaries of bank holding companies. Further, California banks may conduct certain &#8220;financial&#8221; activities permitted under GLBA in a &#8220;financial subsidiary&#8221; to the same extent as may a national bank, provided the bank is and remain s &#32;&#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;well-managed&#8221; and in satisfactory compliance with the CRA. The Bank currently has no financial subsidiaries. 

(i) Enforcement Authority 

The federal and California regulatory structure gives the bank regulatory agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of appropriate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. The regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before an institution&#8217;s capital becomes impaired. The guidelines establish operational and managerial standards generally relating to: (1) internal controls, information systems, and internal audit systems; (2) loan documentation; (3) credit underwriting; (4) interest-rate exposure; (5) asset growth and asset quality; and (6) compensation, fees, and benefits. Further, the regulatory agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves. If, as a result of an examination, the DBO or the FRB should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of the Bank&#8217;s operations are unsatisfactory or that the Bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, the DBO and the FRB , &#32;and separately the FDIC as insurer of the Bank&#8217;s deposits, have residual authority to: 

Require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice; 

Direct an increase in capital and the maintenance of higher specific minimum capital ratios, which could preclude the Bank from being deemed well capitalized and restrict its ability to accept certain brokered deposits; 

Restrict the Bank&#8217;s growth geographically, by products and services, or by mergers and acquisitions, including bidding in FDIC receiverships for failed banks; 

Enter into or issue informal or formal enforcement actions, including required Board resolutions, Matters Requiring Board Attention, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders or prompt corrective action orders to take corrective action and cease unsafe and unsound practices; 

Require prior approval of senior executive officer or director changes; remove officers and directors and assess civil monetary penalties; and 

Terminate FDIC insurance, revoke the charter and/or take possession of and close and liquidate the Bank or appoint the FDIC as receiver. 

(j) Deposit Insurance 

The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, of federally insured banks and savings institutions and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and savings industries. The FDIC insures our customer deposits through the DIF up to prescribed limits for each depositor. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors. The FDIC may terminate a depository institution&#8217;s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution&#8217;s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of the bank&#8217;s depositors. The termination of deposit insurance for a bank would also result in the revocation of the bank&#8217;s charter by the DBO. 

Our FDIC insurance expense totaled $2.4 million for 2015 . We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance, which can be affected by the cost of bank failures to the FDIC among other factors. Any future increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material and adverse effect on our earnings and could have a material adverse effect on the value of, or market for, our common stock. 

(k) Prompt Corrective Action Provisions 

The FDI Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards, including requiring the prompt submission of an acceptable capital restoration plan. Depending on the bank&#8217;s capital ratios, the agencies&#8217; regulations define five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. At each successive lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to more restrictions, including restrictions on the bank&#8217;s activities, operational practices or the ability to pay dividends. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. 

The prompt corrective action standards were changed when the new capital rule ratios became effective. Under the new standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the Bank is required to meet the new common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5%, an increased Tier 1 ratio of 8% (increased from 6%), a total capital ratio of 10% (unchanged) and a leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged). 

(l) Dividends 

It is the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization&#8217;s expected future needs and financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve also discourages dividend payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. 

The Bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its holding company. The Company is dependent on the performance of the Bank for funds which may be received as dividends from the Bank for use in the operation of the Company and the ability of the Company to pay dividends to shareholders. Future cash dividends by the Bank will also depend upon management&#8217;s assessment of future capital requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. When effective, the new capital rules may restrict dividends by the Bank if the additional capital conservation buffer is not achieved. 

The power of the board of directors of the Bank to declare a cash dividend to the Company is subject to California law, which restricts the amount available for cash dividends to the lesser of a bank&#8217;s retained earnings or net income for its last three fiscal years (less any distributions to shareholders made during such period). Where the above test is not met, cash dividends may still be paid, with the prior approval of the DBO, in an amount not exceeding the greatest of (1) retained earnings of the bank; (2) the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year; or (3) the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year. 

In addition, under federal law, a member bank, such as the Bank, may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during the calendar year, including a proposed dividend, exceeds the sum of the Bank&#8217;s net income during 

the calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two calendar years, unless the dividend has been approved by the FRB. 

(m) Operations and Consumer Compliance Laws 

The Bank must comply with numerous federal and state anti-money laundering and consumer protection statutes and implementing regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, the CRA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the National Flood Insurance Act, the California Homeowner Bill of Rights and various federal and state privacy protection laws. Noncompliance with any of these laws could subject the Bank to compliance enforcement actions as well as lawsuits and could also result in administrative penalties, including, fines and reimbursements. The Bank and the Company are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition. 

These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure and reporting requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, servicing, collecting and foreclosure of loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to enforcement actions, injunctions, fines or criminal penalties, punitive damages to consumers, and the loss of certain contractual rights. 

Dodd-Frank provided for the creation of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve with broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards. The CFPB's functions include investigating consumer complaints, conducting market research, rulemaking, supervising and examining bank consumer transactions, and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services. CFPB regulations and guidance apply to all financial institutions, with banks of $10 billion or more in assets subject to examination by the CFPB. Banks with less than $10 billion in assets, including the Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance by their primary federal banking agency. 

In 2015 , the CFPB adopted revisions to Regulation Z, which implement the Truth in Lending Act, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, and apply to all consumer mortgages (except home equity lines of credit, timeshare plans, reverse mortgages, or temporary loans). The revisions mandate specific underwriting criteria for home loans in order for creditors to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer&#8217;s ability to repay and establish certain protections from liability under this requirement for &#8220;qualified mortgages&#8221; meeting certain standards. In particular, it will prevent banks from making &#8220;no doc&#8221; and &#8220;low doc&#8221; home loans, as the rules require that banks determine a consumer&#8217;s ability to pay based in part on verified and documented information. Because we do not originate &#8220;no doc&#8221; or &#8220;low doc&#8221; loans, we do not believe this regulation will have a significant impact on our operations. However, because a substantial portion of the mortgage loans originated by the Bank do not meet the definitions for a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; under final regulations adopted by the CFPB, the Bank may be subject to additional disclosure obligations and extended time periods for the assertion of defenses by the borrower against enforcement in connection with such mortgage loans. 

(n) Federal Home Loan Bank System 

The Bank is a member and holder of the capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (&#8220;FHLBSF&#8221;). There are a total of twelve Federal Home Loan Banks (each, an &#8220;FHLB&#8221;) across the U.S. owned by their members who are more than 7,500 community financial institutes of all sizes and types. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region and makes available loans or advances to its members. Each FHLB is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. Each FHLB makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the individual FHLB. Each member of FHLBSF is required to own stock in an amount equal to the greater of (i) a membership stock requirement of 1.0 percent of an institution&#8217;s &#8220;membership asset value&#8221; which is determined by multiplying the amount of the member&#8217;s membership assets by the applicable membership asset factors and is capped at $25 million, or (ii) an activity based stock requirement (4.7% of the member&#8217;s outstanding advances plus 5.0% of the member&#8217;s outstanding mortgage loans purchased and held by FHLBSF). At December 31, 2015 , the Bank was in compliance with the FHLBSF&#8217;s stock ownership requirement, and our investment in FHLBSF capital stock totaled $16.4 million. The total borrowing capacity available based on pledged collateral and the remaining available borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2015 &#32;were $457.2 million and $287.2 million, respectively. 

(o) Impact of Monetary Policies 

The earnings and growth of the Bank are largely dependent on its ability to maintain a favorable differential or spread between the yield on its interest-earning assets and the rates paid on its deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. As a result, the Bank&#8217;s performance is influenced by general economic conditions, both domestic and foreign, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, and the policies of the regulatory agencies. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policies (such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession) by its open-market operations in U.S. government securities, by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve requirements, and by varying the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks from the Federal Reserve Banks. The actions of the Federal Reserve in these areas influence the growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits, and also affect interest rates charged on loans and deposits. The nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted. 

(p) Securities Regulation and Corporate Governance 

The Company&#8217;s common stock is publicly held and listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (&#8220;NASDAQ&#8221;), and the Company is subject to the periodic reporting, information, proxy solicitation, insider trading, corporate governance and other requirements and restrictions of the Exchange Act and the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) promulgated thereunder as well as listing requirements of NASDAQ. 

The Company is subject to the accounting oversight and corporate governance requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including, among other things, required executive certification of financial presentations, requirements for board audit committees and their members, and disclosure of controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. 

The Company is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act, and the Exchange Act, both as administered by the SEC. As a company listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the Company is subject to NASDAQ listing standards for listed companies. The Company is also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other federal and state laws and regulations which address, among other issues, required executive certification of financial presentations, corporate governance requirements for board audit and compensation committees and their members, and disclosure of controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. NASDAQ has also adopted corporate governance rules, which facilitate stockholders and investors to monitor the performance of companies and their directors. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management and the Company&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm are required to assess the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 . These assessments are included in Part II &#8212; Item 9A &#8212; &#8220;Controls and Procedures.&#8221; 

(q) Audit Requirements 

The Bank is required to have an annual independent audit, alone or as a part of its bank holding company&#8217;s audit, and to prepare all financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Bank and the Company are also each required to have an audit committee comprised entirely of independent directors. As required by NASDAQ, the Company has certified that its audit committee has adopted formal written charters and meets the requisite number of directors, independence, and other qualification standards. As such, among other requirements, the Company must maintain an audit committee that includes members with banking or related financial management expertise, has access to its own outside counsel, and does not include members who are large customers of the Bank. In addition, because the Bank has more than $4 billion in total assets, it is subject to the FDIC requirements for audit committees of large institutions. 

(r) Regulation of Non-Bank Subsidiaries 

Non-bank subsidiaries are subject to additional or separate regulation and supervision by other state, federal and self-regulatory bodies. Additionally, any foreign-based subsidiaries would also be subject to foreign laws and regulations.
