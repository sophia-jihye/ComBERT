General

The Bank was organized in 1916. The Bank is a Pennsylvania chartered full-service, community-oriented savings bank. We provide financial services to individuals, families and businesses through our 26 full-service banking offices, located in Monroe, Northampton, Lehigh, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery Counties, Pennsylvania. The Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In March 2014, the Bank converted its charter from a Pennsylvania savings and loan association to a Pennsylvania savings bank. The charter change did not have a material effect on the operations of the Bank.

The Bank&#8217;s business consists primarily of accepting deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in residential first mortgage loans (including construction mortgage loans), commercial real estate loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, commercial and consumer loans (including indirect auto loans). We offer a variety of deposit accounts, including checking, savings and certificates of deposits. We also offer asset management and trust services. We offer investment services through our relationship with Cetera Investment Services LLC, a third party broker/dealer and investment advisor. We offer insurance benefit consulting services through our wholly owned subsidiary, ESSA Advisory Services, LLC.

The Bank&#8217;s executive offices are located at 200 Palmer Street, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania 18360. Our telephone number at this address is (570) 421-0531. Our website address is www.essabank.com .

Loan Originations and Repayments. We originate residential mortgage loans pursuant to underwriting standards that generally conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines. Loan origination activities are primarily concentrated in Monroe, Northampton, Lehigh, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties, Pennsylvania and secondarily in other Pennsylvania counties contiguous to our primary market area. New loans are generated primarily from the efforts of employees and advertising, a network of select mortgage brokers, other parties with whom we do business, customer referrals, and from walk-in customers. Loan applications are centrally underwritten and processed at our corporate center. 

One- to four-family Residential Loans. Historically, our principal lending activity has consisted of the origination of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans secured primarily by properties located in Monroe, Northampton, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Lehigh, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties, Pennsylvania. At September 30, 2016, $596.6 million, or 48.6%, of our loan 

portfolio, consisted of one- to four-family residential loans. Our origination of one- to four-family loans increased in fiscal year 2016 compared to fisca l year 2015 and fiscal year 2014. Generally, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans are originated in amounts up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property, although loans may be made with higher loan-to-value rat ios if private mortgage insurance is specified to compensate for the risk. Fixed-rate loans are originated for terms of 10, 15, 20 and 30 years. At September 30, 2016, our largest loan secured by one- to four-family real estate had a principal balance of a pproximately $1.9 million and was secured by a single family house. This loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms. 

We also offer adjustable-rate mortgage loans which have initial fixed terms of one, three, five or seven-years before converting to an annual adjustment schedule based on changes in a designated United States Treasury index. We originated $5.0 million of adjustable rate one- to four-family residential loans during the year ended September 30, 2016 and $2.2 million during the year ended September 30, 2015. Our adjustable rate mortgage loans provide for maximum rate adjustments of 200 basis points per adjustment, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 500 basis points. Our adjustable rate mortgage loans amortize over terms of up to 30 years.

Adjustable rate mortgage loans decrease the risk associated with changes in market interest rates by periodically repricing, but involve other risks. As interest rates increase, the principal and interest payments on the loan increase, thus increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Adjustment of the contractual interest rate is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustments specified by our loan documents and therefore, is potentially limited in effectiveness during periods of rapidly rising interest rates. At September 30, 2016, $41.1 million, or 6.9%, of our one- to four-family residential loans had adjustable rates of interest.

All one- to four-family residential mortgage loans that we originate include &#8220;due-on-sale&#8221; clauses, which provides the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that the borrower sells or otherwise conveys title to the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid.

Regulations limit the amount that a savings bank may lend relative to the value of the real estate securing the loan, as determined by an appraisal of the property at the time the loan is originated. For all purchase money loans, we utilize outside independent appraisers approved by the Board of Directors. All purchase money and most refinance loans require a lender&#8217;s title insurance policy. Certain modest refinance requests may utilize an automated valuation model with an exterior inspection report and title search. We also require fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance.

Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. Home equity loans and lines of credit are generated by our loan originators. Eligible properties include primary and vacation homes in northeastern Pennsylvania, with the majority of loans being originated in Monroe, Northampton and Lehigh Counties. As of September 30, 2016, home equity loans and lines totaled about $48.2 million, or 3.9%, of our loan portfolio. 

The maximum combined loan-to-value originated is currently 80%, depending on the collateral and the holder of the first mortgage. There is a small portion of the portfolio originated in years past that contains original combined loan-to-values of up to 90%. Our home equity lines of credit typically feature a 10 year draw period with interest-only payments permitted, followed by another 10 years of fully amortizing payments with no further ability to draw funds. Similar combined loan-to-value characteristics and standards exist for the lines as are outlined above for the loans.

Loan underwriting standards limit the maximum size of a junior lien loan to between $100,000 and $200,000, depending on the loan type and collateral. All loans exceeding 70-75% of value require an appraisal by bank-approved, licensed appraisers. Loans up to $25,000 with lesser loan-to-value ratios may utilize an automated valuation model. Title/lien searches are secured on all home equity loans and lines greater than $25,000.

Commercial Real Estate Loans. At September 30, 2016, $288.4 million, or 23.5%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans are secured by office buildings, mixed-use properties and other commercial properties. We generally originate adjustable rate commercial real estate loans with an initial term of five years and a repricing option, and a maximum term of up to 25 years. The maximum loan-to-value ratio for most commercial real estate loans is 75% to 80% and 85% for select loans with faster amortizations. At September 30, 2016, our largest commercial real estate relationship balance was $13.6 million, which was performing in accordance with its terms. 

We consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including credit history, profitability and expertise, as well as the value and condition of the mortgaged property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower&#8217;s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower&#8217;s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the 

debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service) to ensure that it is at least 120% of the monthly debt service. All commercial real estate loans in excess of $250,000 are appraised by outside independent appraisers approved by the Board of Directors. Personal guarantees are obtained from commercial real estate borrowers although we may occasionally waive this requirement given very strong loan to value and debt service coverage ratios. All pur chase money and most asset refinance borrowers are required to obtain title insurance. We also require fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance. 

Loans secured by commercial real estate generally are considered to present greater risk than one- to four-family residential loans. Commercial real estate loans often involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Repayment of these loans depends to a large degree on the results of operations and management of the properties securing the loans or the businesses conducted on such property, and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. Accordingly, the nature of these loans makes them more difficult for management to monitor and evaluate.

First Mortgage Construction Loans. At September 30, 2016, $1.7 million, or 0.1%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of first mortgage construction loans. Our first mortgage construction loans are for the construction of residential properties. We currently offer fixed and adjustable-rate residential first mortgage construction loans. First mortgage construction loans are generally structured for permanent mortgage financing once the construction is completed. At September 30, 2016, our largest first mortgage construction loan balance was $321,000. The loan was performing in accordance with its terms. First mortgage construction loans will generally be made in amounts of up to 80% of the appraised value of the completed property, or the actual cost of the improvements. First mortgage construction loans require only the payment of interest during the construction period. Once converted to permanent financing, they generally repay over a 30 year period. Funds are disbursed based on our inspections in accordance with a schedule reflecting the completion of portions of the project. 

First mortgage construction loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than other one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. The risk of loss on a construction loan depends, in part, upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost of construction and the successful completion of construction within budget.

For all such loans, we utilize outside independent appraisers approved by the Board of Directors. All borrowers are required to obtain title insurance. We also require fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance on properties.

Commercial Loans. At September 30, 2016, approximately $40.0 million, or 3.3%, of our loan portfolio, consisted of commercial loans. We generally offer commercial loans to individuals and businesses located in our primary market area. The commercial loan portfolio includes lines of credit, equipment loans, vehicle loans, improvement loans and term loans. These loans are primarily secured by vehicles, machinery and equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, marketable securities, deposit accounts and real estate. 

Obligations of States and Political Subdivisions. At September 30, 2016, $56.9 million, or 4.6%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of loan transactions including tax and revenue anticipation notes, general obligation notes, and authority general revenue notes. The financial strength of the state or political subdivision, type of transaction, relationship efforts, and profitability of return are considered when pricing and structuring each transaction. 

Auto Loans. At September 30, 2016, $193.1 million, or 15.7% of our total loan portfolio consisted of auto loans. Franklin Security specialized in indirect automobile lending. After the acquisition of Franklin Security, the Bank retained a number of their experienced employees. Although collateralized, these loans require stringent underwriting standards and procedures. Each loan decision is based primarily on the credit history of the individual(s) and their ability to repay the loan. Collision and comprehensive insurance is required and the Bank must be listed as the loss payee. 

Indirect auto loans are inherently risky as they are often secured by assets that depreciate rapidly. In some cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted automobile loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency may not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. Automobile loan collections depend on the borrower&#8217;s continuing financial stability, and therefore, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, or personal bankruptcy.

Other Loans. We offer a variety of loans that are either unsecured or secured by property other than real estate. These loans include loans secured by deposits and personal unsecured loans. At September 30, 2016, these other loans totaled $3.3 million, or 0.3%, of the total loan portfolio. 

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan, and the adequacy of the value of the property that will secure the loan. To assess the borrower&#8217;s 

ability to repay, we review each borrower&#8217;s employment and credit history and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of mortgagors. For all loans the Board has granted lending authority to prescribed loan committees. Larger and more complex loan requests require the involvement of senior management or the Board. 

Non-Performing Loans and Problem Assets

Performance of the loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis by Bank Management. A number of factors regarding the borrower, such as overall financial strength, collateral values and repayment ability, are considered in deciding what actions should be taken when determining the collectability of interest for accrual purposes.

When a loan, including a loan that is impaired, is classified as nonaccrual, the accrual of interest on such a loan is discontinued. A loan is typically classified as nonaccrual when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. A loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to management&#8217;s judgment as to the collectability of principal.

Loans are usually restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time, and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.

Non-performing Loans. At September 30, 2016, $19.3 million, or 1.57% of our total loans, were non-performing loans. The majority of these loans were commercial real estate loans and residential mortgage loans. Non-performing commercial real estate loans totaled $8.1 million at September 30, 2016. Residential first mortgage loans that were 90 days or more past due or classified as non-performing troubled debt restructured loans totaled $9.0 million at September 30, 2016. In connection with the ENB acquisition, the Company acquired loans with deteriorated credit quality totaling $3.5 million. These loans were carried at $1.8 million at September 30, 2016. The Company acquired no loans with deteriorated credit quality in connection with the acquisition of Franklin Security Bank in April 2014, and acquired no non-performing assets from First National Community Bank in January 2014. 

Real Estate Owned. At September 30, 2016, the Company had $2.7 million of real estate owned consisting of 34 properties. These properties are being carried on the Company&#8217;s books at fair value less estimated costs to sell. All these properties are being actively marketed and additional losses may occur.

Non-performing troubled debt restructurings are included in total troubled debt restructurings as part of the non-performing assets table.

For the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012, gross interest income that would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms was $779,000, $188,000, $660,000, $883,000 and $592,000, respectively.

At Septem ber 30, 2016, the principal balance of troubled debt restructures was $7.8 million as compared to $7.6 million at September 30, 2015. Of the $7.8 million of troubled debt restructures at September 30, 2016, $433,000 are performing loans and $7.4 million ar e non-accrual loans. 

Of the 57 loans that comprised our troubled debt restructures at September 30, 2016, no loans were granted a rate concession at a below market interest rate, 21 loans with balances totaling $3.0 million were granted market rate and terms concessions, 24 loans with balances totaling $4.1 million were granted terms concessions and 12 loans with balances totaling $722,000 were granted interest rate concessions.

Troubled debt restructured loans at September 30, 2016 were comprised of 46 residential loans totaling $5.0 million, 8 commercial real estate loans totaling $2.6, and 3 consumer loans (home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, and other) totaling $234,000.

For the year ended September 30, 2016, 18 loans totaling $2.5 million were removed from TDR status, 4 loans totaling $497,000 were transferred to foreclosed real estate, 10 loans for $1.5 million had completed timely payments, and 4 loan totaling $446,000 was paid off.

We have modified terms of performing loans that do not meet the definition of a TDR. The vast majority of such loans were simply rate modifications of residential first mortgage loans in lieu of refinancing. The non-TDR rate modifications were all performing loans when the rates were reset to current market rates. For the year ended September 30, 2016, we modified 29 loans totaling $3.9 million. With regard to commercial loans, including commercial real estate loans, various non-troubled loans were modified, either for the purpose of a rate reduction to reflect current market rates (in lieu of a refinance) or the extension of a loan&#8217;s maturity date. In total we modified 9 commercial loans with an aggregate balance of approximately $10.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2016.

Delinquencies. The following tab le sets forth certain information with respect to our loan portfolio delinquencies at the dates indicated. Loans delinquent for 90 days or more are generally classified as nonaccrual loans.

Classified Assets. Banking re gulations and our Asset Classification Policy provide that loans and other assets considered to be of lesser quality should be classified as &#8220;Substandard,&#8221; &#8220;Doubtful&#8221; or &#8220;Loss&#8221; assets. An asset is considered Substandard if it is inadequately protected by t he current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Asse ts classified as Doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and value s, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as Loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. We classify an asset as &#8220;Sp ecial Mention&#8221; if the asset has a potential weakness that warrants management&#8217;s close attention. While such assets are not impaired, management has concluded that if the potential weakness in the asset is not addressed, the value of the asset may deteriora te, thereby adversely affecting the repayment of the asset. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company classified approximately $12.3 million of our assets as Special Mention of which $9.1 million were commercial and commercial real estate loans and $33.3 million as Substandard of which $22.6 million were commercial and commercial real estate loans. No loans were classified Doubtful or Loss. On the basis of management&#8217;s review of its assets, at September 30, 2015, we classified approximately $8.7 million of our assets as Special Mention of which $4.5 million were commercial and commercial real estate loans and $36.6 million as Substandard of which $21.5 million were commercial and commercial real estate loans. No loans were classified as Doubtful or Loss.

The loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Not all classified assets constitute non-performing assets.

Allowance for Loan Losses

Our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level necessary to absorb loan losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Management, in determining the allowance for loan losses, considers the losses inherent in its loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activities, along with the general economic and real estate market conditions. Our allowance for loan losses consists of two elements: (1) an allocated allowance, which comprises allowances established on specific loans and class allowances based on historical loss experience and current trends, and (2) an unallocated allowance based on general economic conditions and other risk factors in our markets and portfolios. We maintain a loan review system, which allows for a periodic review (at least quarterly) of our loan portfolio and the early identification of potential impaired loans. Such system takes into consideration, among other things, delinquency status, size of loans, type and market value of collateral and financial condition of the borrowers. Specific loan loss allowances are established for identified losses based on a review of such information. A loan evaluated for impairment is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All loans identified as impaired are evaluated independently. We do not aggregate such loans for evaluation purposes. Loan impairment is measured based on the fair value of collateral method, taking into account the appraised value, any valuation assumptions used, estimated costs to sell and trends in the market since the appraisal date. General loan loss allowances are based upon a combination of factors including, but not limited to, actual loan loss experience, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, management&#8217;s judgment and losses which are probable and reasonably estimable. The allowance is increased through provisions charged against current earnings and recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Loans that are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. While management uses available information to recognize probable and reasonably estimable loan losses, future loss provisions may be necessary based on changing economic conditions. Payments received on impaired loans generally are either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to management&#8217;s judgment as to the collectability of principal. The allowance for loan losses as of September 30, 2016 is maintained at a level that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio, and such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable.

In addition, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221;), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. The banking regulators may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their analysis and review of information available to them at the time of their examination.

The following table sets forth activity in our allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.

Loans acquired by the Company as a result of the Company&#8217;s mergers with ENB which closed on December 4, 2015, First Star, which closed on July 31, 2012, and Franklin Security, which closed on April 4, 2014, were recorded at fair value on the purchase date without the carryover of any related allowance for loan losses. At each reporting date subsequent to their purchase, these loans have been included in the Company&#8217;s evaluation of the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses. At September 30, 2012, there were $207.1 million of former First Star loans without an accompanying allowance for loan loss included in the Company&#8217;s total loans when calculating the allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio. At September 30, 2013, there were $155.4 million of loans of former First Star loans included in the Company&#8217;s total loans when calculating the loan loss to total loans ratio. At September 30, 2013 there was an allowance for loan losses of $257,000 related to First Star loan that was included in the allowance for loan losses. This loan was not a significant factor in the increase in the allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio from 0.76% at September 30, 2012 to 0.86% at September 30, 2013. At September 30, 2014, there were $133.1 million of former First Star loans and $128.6 of former Franklin Security loans without an accompanying allowance for loan loss included in the Company&#8217;s total loans when calculating the allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio. These loans were a significant factor in the decline of this ratio from 0.86% at September 30, 2013 to 0.81% at September 30, 2014. At September 30, 2015, there were $111.4 million of former First Star loans and $88.9 million of former Franklin Security loans without an accompanying allowance for loan loss included in the Company&#8217;s total loans when calculating the allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio. These loans were not a significant factor in the decline of this ratio from 0.81% at September 30, 2014 to 0.80% at September 30, 2015. At September 30, 2016 there were $97.9 

million of former First Star loans, $60.6 million of former Franklin Security loans and $97.9 million of former ENB loans with a related allowance for loan loss of $236,000 included in the Company&#8217;s total loans when calcula ting the allowance for loans losses to total loans ratio. These loans were a significant factor in the decline of this ratio from 0.80% at September 30, 2015 to 0.74% at September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2012, there were $9.4 million of former First Sta r loans, without an accompanying allowance for loan losses included in the Company&#8217;s total loans when calculating the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans (ALL to NPL) ratio. At September 30, 2013, there were $7.3 million of former First Star loans included in the Company&#8217;s total loans when calculating the ALL to NPL ratio. At September 30, 2013 there was an allowance for loan losses of $257,000 related to one of these loans that was included in the allowance for loan losses. These loans were n ot a significant factor in the increase in the ALL to NPL ratio to 33.79% at September 30, 2013 from 30.12% at September 30, 2012. At September 30, 2014, there were $11.2 million of former First Star loans and $1.6 million of former Franklin Security loans included in the Company&#8217;s total loans when calculating the ALL to NPL ratio. At September 30, 2014 there was an allowance for loan losses of $66,000 related to one of these loans included in the Company&#8217;s total loans when calculating the ALL to NPL that w as included in the allowance for loan losses. These loans were not a significant factor in the increase in the ALL to NPL ratio from 33.79% at September 30, 2013 to 38.98% at September 30, 2014. At September 30, 2015, there were $6.1 million of former Firs t Star loans and $1.8 million of former Franklin Security loans included in the Company&#8217;s total loans when calculating the ALL to NPL ratio. At September 30, 2015 there was an allowance for loan losses of $266,000 related to these loans included in the Com pany&#8217;s total loans when calculating that was included in the allowance for loan losses. These loans were not a significant factor in the increase in the ALL to NPL ratio from 38.98% at September 30, 2014 to 44.36% at September 30, 2015. At September 30, 20 16, there were $5.0 million of former First Star loans, $1.2 million of former Franklin Security loans and $2.2 of former ENB loans in the Company&#8217;s total loans when calculating the ALL to NPL ratio. At September 30, 2016 there was an allowance for loan lo sses of $236,000 related to these loans included in the allowance for loan losses. These loans were not a significant reason for the increase in the ALL to NPL ratio from 44.36% at September 30, 2015 to 46.89% at September 30, 2016. 

See &#8220;Non-Performing Loans and Problem Assets.&#8221; There can be no assurance that we will not experience a deterioration of our loan portfolio, including increases in non-performing loans, problem assets and charge-offs, in the future.

Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses. The following tables set forth the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan category, the percent of the allowance to the total allowance and the percent of loans in each category to total loans at the dates indicated. The allowance for loan losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories.

We use the accrual method of accounting for all performing loans. The accrual of interest income is generally discontinued when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest previously credited to income is reversed. Interest received on nonaccrual loans is applied against principal. Generally, residential and consumer loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and ultimate collectability of total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. Commercial loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and ultimate collectability of total contractual principal and interest no longer is in doubt.

In our collection efforts, we will first attempt to cure any delinquent loan. If a real estate secured loan is placed on nonaccrual status, it will be subject to transfer to the real estate owned (&#8220;REO&#8221;) portfolio (comprised of properties acquired by or in lieu of foreclosure), upon which our loan servicing department will pursue the sale of the real estate. Prior to this transfer, the loan balance will be reduced, if necessary, to reflect its current market value less estimated costs to sell. Write downs of REO that occur after the initial transfer from the loan portfolio and costs of holding the property are recorded as other operating expenses, except for significant improvements which are capitalized to the extent that the carrying value does not exceed estimated net realizable value.

Fair values for determining the value of collateral are estimated from various sources, such as real estate appraisals, financial statements and from any other reliable sources of available information. For those loans deemed to be impaired, collateral value is reduced for the estimated costs to sell. Reductions of collateral value are based on historical loss experience, current market data, and any other source of reliable information specific to the collateral.

This analysis process is inherently subjective, as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to revisions as more information becomes available. Although we believe that we have established the allowance at levels to absorb probable and estimable losses, future additions may be necessary if economic or other conditions in the future differ from the current environment.

Securities Activities

Our securities investment policy is established by our Board of Directors. This policy dictates that investment decisions be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns, cash flow targets, and consistency with our interest rate risk management strategy. Our investment policy is reviewed annually by our ALCO/Investment management committee. All policy changes recommended by this management committee must be approved by the Board of Directors. The Committee is comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller, Chief Operating Officer, Senior Vice President Retail Services Division and the Senior Vice President Administration/Operations. Authority to make investments under the approved guidelines is delegated by the Committee to appropriate officers. While general investment strategies are developed and authorized by the ALCO / Investment management committee, the execution of specific actions rests with the Chief Financial Officer.

The approved investment officers are authorized to execute investment transactions up to $5.0 million per transaction without the prior approval of the ALCO / Investment management committee and within the scope of the established investment policy. These officers are also authorized to execute investment transactions between $5.0 million and $10.0 million with the additional 

a pproval from the Chief Executive Officer. Each transaction in excess of $10.0 million must receive prior approval of the ALCO/Investment Committee. 

Our current investment policy generally permits investments in debt securities issued by the U.S. government and U.S. agencies, municipal bonds, and corporate debt obligations, as well as investments in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (federal agency securities) and, to a much lesser extent, other equity securities. Securities in these categories are classified as &#8220;investment securities&#8221; for financial reporting purposes. The policy also permits investments in mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through securities issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Government National Mortgage Association (&#8220;GNMA&#8221;) as well as commercial paper, corporate debt and municipal bonds. Our current investment strategy uses a risk management approach of diversified investing in fixed-rate securities with short- to intermediate-term maturities, as well as adjustable-rate securities, which may have a longer term to maturity. The emphasis of this approach is to increase overall investment securities yields while managing interest rate risk.

Our policy is that, at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held to maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, depending on our ability and intent. Securities available-for-sale are reported at fair value, while securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost. Currently, all securities are classified as available-for-sale.

Mortgage-Backed Securities. We purchase mortgage-backed securities in order to generate positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, lower credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and GNMA and increased liquidity. We invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities issued or sponsored by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and GNMA. At September 30, 2016, our mortgage-backed securities portfolio had a fair value of $219.2 million, consisting primarily of Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and GNMA mortgage-backed securities. 

Mortgage-backed securities are created by pooling mortgages and issuing a security collateralized by the pool of mortgages with an interest rate that is less than the interest rate on the underlying mortgages. Mortgage-backed securities typically represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multi-family mortgages, although most of our mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by single-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities (generally U.S. government agencies and U.S. government sponsored enterprises, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and GNMA) pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors, such as the Bank, and guarantee the payment of principal and interest to these investors. Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual prepayments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments, thereby affecting the net yield on such securities. We review prepayment estimates for our mortgage-backed securities at the time of purchase to ensure that prepayment assumptions are reasonable considering the underlying collateral for the securities at issue and current interest rates, and to determine the yield and estimated maturity of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Periodic reviews of current prepayment speeds are performed in order to ascertain whether prepayment estimates require modification that would cause amortization or accretion adjustments.

Equity Securities. At September 30, 2016, our equity securities had a fair value of $25,000. 

In addition, we hold Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (&#8220;FHLB-Pittsburgh&#8221;) common stock to qualify for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System and to be eligible to borrow funds under the FHLB advance program. There is no market for the common stock.

The aggregate fair value of our FHLB-Pittsburgh common stock as of September 30, 2016 was $15.3 million based on its par value. No unrealized gains or losses have been recorded because we have determined that the par value of the common stock represents its fair value. We owned shares of FHLB-Pittsburgh common stock at September 30, 2016 with a par value that was equal to what we were required to own to maintain our membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System and to be eligible to obtain advances. We are required to purchase additional stock as our outstanding advances increase. Any excess stock we own is redeemed weekly by the FHLB-Pittsburgh.

We review equity and debt securities with significant declines in fair value on a periodic basis to determine whether they should be considered temporarily or other than temporarily impaired. If a decline in the fair value of a security is determined to be other than temporary, we are required to reduce the carrying value of the security to its fair value and record a non-cash, credit related impairment charge in the amount of the decline, net of tax effect, against our current income.

Our investment securities portfolio contains unrealized losses on securities, including mortgage-related instruments issued or backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, or generally viewed as having the implied guarantee of the United States government, and debt obligations of a State or political subdivision.

Our policy is to recognize an other-than-tempora ry impairment of equity securities where the fair value has been significantly below cost for four consecutive quarters. For fixed maturity investments with unrealized losses due to interest rates where the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery in market value, declines in value below cost are not assumed to be other than temporary. We review our position quarterly and concluded t hat at September 30, 2016, declines included in the table below represent temporary declines due to interest rate change, and we do not intend to sell those securities and it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell those securities before the ir anticipated recovery in market value. 

The following table sets forth the composition of our securities portfolio (excluding FHLB-Pittsburgh common stock) at the dates indicated.

Sources of Funds 

General. Deposits, borrowings, repayments and prepayments of loans and securities, proceeds from maturing securities and cash flows from operations are the primary sources of our funds for use in lending, investing and for other general purposes. 

Deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposit accounts consist of savings accounts, Interest bearing demand accounts accounts, checking accounts, money market accounts, club accounts, certificates of deposit and IRAs and other qualified plan accounts. We provide commercial checking accounts for businesses. 

At September 30, 2016, our deposits totaled $1.2 billion. Interest-bearing demand deposit, savings and club and money market deposits totaled $559.2 million at September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, we had a total of $512.7 million in certificates of deposit. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits totaled $142.9 million. Although we have a significant portion of our deposits in shorter-term certificates of deposit, we monitor activity on these accounts and, based on historical experience and our current pricing strategy, we believe we will retain a large portion of these accounts upon maturity.

Our deposits are obtained predominantly from the areas in which our branch offices are located. We rely on our favorable locations, customer service and competitive pricing to attract and retain these deposits. While we accept certificates of deposit in excess of $100,000 for which we may provide preferential rates, we generally do not solicit such deposits as they are more difficult to retain than core deposits. At September 30, 2016, we had a total of $198.6 million of brokered certificates of deposits, a decrease of $73.3 million from the prior fiscal year end. Our brokered certificates of deposits range from less than one- to seven-year terms, and are purchased only through pre-approved brokers.

The following table sets forth the distribution of average deposit accounts, by account type, at the dates indicated.

At September 30, 2016, we had the ability to borrow approximately $602.3 million under our credit facilities with the FHLB-Pittsburgh.

Competition

We face significant competition in both originating loans and attracting deposits. The counties in which we operate have a significant concentration of financial institutions, many of which are significantly larger institutions and have greater financial resources, and many of which are our competitors to varying degrees. Our competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, leasing companies, insurance companies and other financial service companies. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from nondepository competitors such as the mutual fund industry, securities and brokerage firms and insurance companies.

We seek to meet this competition by the convenience of our branch locations, emphasizing personalized banking and the advantage of local decision-making in our banking business. Specifically, we promote and maintain relationships and build customer loyalty within local communities by focusing our marketing and community involvement on the specific needs of individual neighborhoods. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank had the largest deposit market share in Monroe County, Pennsylvania. We do not rely on any individual, group, or entity for a material portion of our deposits.

Employees

As of September 30, 2016, we had 285 full-time employees, and 41 part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

General

The Company is a Pennsylvania corporation. The Company was formerly regulated as a savings and loan holding company, and in November 2014 took the steps necessary to be regulated as a bank holding company. As a bank holding company, we are required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board.

The Bank is a Pennsylvania-chartered savings bank and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;). We are subject to extensive regulation by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the &#8220;Department&#8221;), our chartering agency, and by the FDIC, our primary federal regulator. We must file reports with the Department and the FDIC concerning our activities and financial condition, in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other savings institutions. There are periodic examinations by the Department and the FDIC to test our compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and with their examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the Department or the FDIC could have a material adverse impact on us and our operations.

Federal Legislation

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), enacted on July 21, 2010, has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and is affecting the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to set minimum capital levels for depository institution holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries with the components of Tier 1 capital restricted to capital instruments considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. The legislation established a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards then in effect, and directed the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within 18 months from the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives. The required capital regulations have been issued and were effective January 1, 2015.

The Dodd-Frank Act also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) with substantial power to implement and oversee consumer protection laws. The CFPB Bureau has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as the Bank, including the authority to prohibit &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#8221; acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets continue to be examined for compliance by their applicable bank regulators.

The legislation broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a depository institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2008. The Dodd-Frank Act increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called &#8220;golden parachute&#8221; payments, and by authorizing the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company&#8217;s proxy materials. The Dodd-Frank Act also provided for originators of certain securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for transferred loans, directed the Federal Reserve Board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage origination.

The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits lenders from making residential mortgages unless the lender makes a reasonable and good faith determination that the borrower has a reasonable ability to repay the mortgage loan according to its terms. A borrower may recover statutory damages equal to all finance charges and fees paid within three years of a violation of the ability-to-repay rule and may raise a violation as a defense to foreclosure at any time. As authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB has adopted regulations defining &#8220;qualified mortgages&#8221; that are presumed to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s ability-to-repay rules. Under the CFPB regulations, qualified mortgages must satisfy the following criteria: (i) no negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments or a term greater than 30 years; (ii) no points or fees in excess of 3% of the loan amount for loans over $100,000; (iii) borrower&#8217;s income and assets are verified and documented; and (iv) the borrower&#8217;s debt-to-income ratio generally may not exceed 43%. Qualified mortgages are conclusively presumed to comply with the ability-to-repay rule unless the mortgage is a &#8220;higher cost&#8221; mortgage, in which case the presumption is rebuttable. The Bank will not grant a non-qualified mortgage loan unless such loan falls 

under the &#8220;temporary qualified mortgage&#8221; guidance and there were additional factors to support the exception (which may include a review of the borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness and whether a deposit relationship exists). 

Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act had delayed effective dates and required extensive regulations. Although the ultimate impact of these regulations cannot be completely determined at this time, it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations will increase our operating and compliance costs.

Regulation by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities

The Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, as amended (the &#8220;Banking Code&#8221;) contains detailed provisions governing the organization, location of offices, rights and responsibilities of directors, officers, employees, and depositors, as well as corporate powers, savings and investment operations and other aspects of the Bank and its affairs. The Banking Code delegates extensive rulemaking power and administrative discretion to the Department so that the supervision and regulation of state-chartered savings banks may be flexible and readily responsive to changes in economic conditions and in savings and lending practices. The Department may also take enforcement actions against savings banks and may appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings bank under certain circumstances.

The Department generally examines each savings bank not less frequently than once every two years. Although the Department may accept the examinations and reports of the FDIC in lieu of the Department&#8217;s examination, the current practice is for the Department to conduct individual examinations. The Department may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any trustee, officer, attorney, or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Department has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Department why such person should not be removed.

The Bank was formerly a Pennsylvania savings association. Changes to Pennsylvania law repealed the Savings Association Code. Consequently, in March 2014, the Bank converted its charter to a Pennsylvania savings bank whose state law powers are primarily governed by Chapter 5 of the Pennsylvania Baking Code of 1965, as amended. The charter conversion did not have a material effect on the operations of the Bank.

Regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

The Bank is also subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision, among other things, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as its primary federal regulator. Such regulation and supervision:

&#160;

&#8226; 

limits the investment authority of the Bank; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

establishes a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with the Bank&#8217;s safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

establishes various capital categories resulting in various levels of regulatory scrutiny applied to the institutions in a particular category; and 

&#160;

&#8226; 

establishes standards for safety and soundness. 

The FDIC generally examines each savings bank not less frequently than once every two years. The FDIC has the authority to order any savings bank or its directors, trustees, officers, attorneys or employees to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound banking practice.

Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC.

Before making a new investment or engaging in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured savings bank must seek approval from the FDIC to make such investment or engage in such activity. The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the savings bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance funds. Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a &#8220;financial subsidiary&#8221; are subject to additional restrictions. Although the Bank meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries, it has not chosen to engage in such activities.

Transactions with Affiliates 

Transactions between an insured bank, such as the Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and implementing regulations. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. Generally, a subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution or financial subsidiary is not treated as an affiliate of the bank under Sections 23A and 23B but instead is considered part of the Bank for purposes of the applicable limits and requirements.

Section 23A:

&#160;

&#8226; 

limits the extent to which a bank and its subsidiaries may engage in &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such bank&#8217;s capital stock and retained earnings, and limits all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and retained earnings; and 

&#160;

&#8226; 

requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. 

The term &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions. Most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100% to 130% of the loan amounts, depending on the type of collateral. In addition, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate.

Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts.

Under the FDIC&#8217;s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions were assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution&#8217;s rate depended upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations. Institutions deemed less risky pay FDIC assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution&#8217;s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated the risk categories and base assessments for most banks on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure over three years. In conjunction with the DIF reserve ratio achieving 1.5%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was also reduced for most banks to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points.

The FDIC may adjust its assessment scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment.

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Bank does not believe that it is taking or is subject to any action, condition or violation that could lead to termination of its deposit insurance.

All FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on obligations issued by the Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the annualized FICO assessment was 0.56 basis points of an institution&#8217;s total assets less tier 1 capital.

Capital Requirements

Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets, and a Tier 1 capital to total adjusted assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.

The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively, and a leverage ratio of at least 4% Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholde rs&#8217; equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in eq uity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified re quirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 

In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets ( e.g. , recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four- family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.

In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.

In assessing an institution&#8217;s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary.

At September 30, 2016, the Bank&#8217;s capital exceeded all applicable requirements.

Any state-chartered savings bank that fails any of the capital requirements is subject to possible enforcement actions by the FDIC. Such actions could include a capital directive, a cease and desist order, civil money penalties, the establishment of restrictions on an institution&#8217;s operations, termination of federal deposit insurance, and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. Certain corrective actions are required by law, as described further under &#8220;Prompt Corrective Action.&#8221;

We are also subject to capital regulations of the Department which generally incorporate federal requirements.

Dividends from ESSA Bank &#38; Trust

Our ability to pay dividends depends, to a large extent, upon the Bank&#8217;s ability to pay dividends to ESSA Bancorp . The Banking Code states, that no dividend may be paid out of surplus without approval of the Department. Dividends may be paid out of accumulated net earnings. No dividend may generally be paid that would result in the Bank failing to comply with its regulatory capital requirements.

Prompt Corrective Action

Under the federal Prompt Corrective Action regulations, a savings bank is deemed to be (i) &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has total risk-based capital of 10.0% or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, a Tier I leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or more, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or more and is not subject to any written capital order or directive; (ii) &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or more, a Tier I leverage capital ratio of 4.0% or more, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% or more, and does not meet the definition of &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;; (iii) &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0%, a Tier I leverage capital ratio that is less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.5%, (iv) &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.0%, a Tier I leverage capital ratio that is less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3%; and (v) &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. Federal regulations also specify 

circumstances under which a federal banking agency may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the n ext lower category (except that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized). 

Generally, the FDIC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings bank that becomes &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date a savings bank receives notice that it is &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; Any holding company for the savings bank required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of: an amount equal to 5% of a savings bank&#8217;s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the FDIC, or the amount necessary to restore the savings bank to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the FDIC notifies the savings bank that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. The FDIC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against an undercapitalized savings bank, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.

The Prompt Corrective categories discussed above were effective January 1, 2015 and reflect the revised regulatory capital requirements effective the same date.

As of September 30, 2016, the Bank was a &#8220;well-capitalized institution&#8221; under the Prompt Corrective Action regulations.

The USA PATRIOT Act

The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 gave the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act also required the federal banking agencies to take into consideration the effectiveness of controls designed to combat money laundering activities in determining whether to approve a merger or other acquisition application of a member institution. Accordingly, if we engage in a merger or other acquisition, our controls designed to combat money laundering would be considered as part of the application process. We have established policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations.

Holding Company Regulation

Federal Regulation. The Company is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company and is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the &#8220;Bank Holding Company Act&#8221;), as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. This eliminated the inclusion of certain instruments from tier 1 capital, such as trust preferred securities, that were previously includable for bank holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act grandfathered instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary institutions applied to bank holding companies of greater than $1.0 billion in assets, including the Company, effective January 1, 2015. As in the case with the institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer is being phased in between 2016 and 2019. 

Regulations of the Federal Reserve Board provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength policy and required the issuance of implementing regulations. Under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank must guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of an undercapitalized bank. If an undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividend or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, Federal Reserve Board policy is that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company&#8217;s net income for the past year is consistent with the company&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.

A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, will be equal to 10% or more of the company&#8217;s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. Such notice and approval is not 

required for a b ank holding company that is &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, that has received a composite &#8220;1&#8221; or &#8220;2&#8221; rating, as well as a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating for management, at its most recent bank holding company examinatio n by the Federal Reserve Board, and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues. Federal Reserve Board guidance provides for agency prior review of bank holding company dividends and stock redemptions and repurchases in certain additional circumstances, which may affect our ability to pay dividends. 

As a financial holding company, we are permitted (1) to engage in other activities that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally, or (2) to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities. We may not, however, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank holding company or a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.

In order to maintain our status as a financial holding company, we must remain &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed&#8221; under applicable regulations and maintain a satisfactory or better rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. Failure to meet one or more of the requirements would mean, depending on the requirements not met, that we could not undertake new activities, make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies, or continue certain activities.

Federal Securities Laws

Shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock are registered with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). The Company is also subject to the proxy rules, tender offer rules, insider trading restrictions, annual and periodic reporting, and other requirements of the Exchange Act.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted in response to public concerns regarding corporate accountability in connection with certain accounting scandals. The stated goals of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally applies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act includes specific additional disclosure requirements, requires the Securities and Exchange Commission and national securities exchanges to adopt extensive additional disclosure, corporate governance and other related rules, and mandates further studies of certain issues by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees.

Although we have and will continue to incur additional expense in complying with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the resulting regulations, management does not expect that such compliance will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

Regulatory Enforcement Authority

Federal law provides federal banking regulators with substantial enforcement powers. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders, and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties, as defined. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities.

FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION

Federal Taxation

General. ESSA Bancorp, Inc. and the Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to ESSA Bancorp, Inc. and the Bank. 

Method of Accounting. For federa l income tax purposes, ESSA Bancorp, Inc. currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending September 30 for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns. The Small Business Protection Act of 199 6 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for bad debt reserves by savings institutions, effective for taxable years beginning after 1995. 

Bad Debt Reserves. Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996, the Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts for tax purposes and to make annual additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at the Bank&#8217;s taxable income. As a result of the Small Business Protection Act of 1996, the Bank must use the specific charge off method in computing its bad debt deduction for tax purposes. 

Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996, bad debt reserves created prior to 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if the Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definition tests. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated these thrift-related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 reserves remain subject to tax recapture should the Bank make certain distributions from its tax bad debt reserve or cease to maintain a financial institution charter. At September 30, 2016, the Bank&#8217;s total federal pre-1988 reserve was approximately $4.6 million. This reserve reflects the cumulative effects of federal tax deductions by the Bank for which no federal income tax provision has been made. 

Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, referred to as &#8220;alternative minimum taxable income.&#8221; The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent alternative minimum tax income is in excess of the regular income tax. Net operating losses can, in general, offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. At September 30, 2016, the Bank had a $356,000 minimum tax credit carryforward. 

Net Operating Loss Carryovers. A financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years (five years for losses incurred in 2001, 2002 and 2009) and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At September 30, 2016, the Bank had no net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes. 

Corporate Dividends. We may exclude from our income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. 

Audit of Tax Returns. ESSA Bancorp&#8217;s federal income tax returns have not been audited in the most recent three-year period. The 2012, 2013, and 2014 tax years remain open. 

State Taxation
