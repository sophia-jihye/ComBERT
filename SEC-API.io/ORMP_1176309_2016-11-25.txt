DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

We are a pharmaceutical company currently engaged in the research and development of innovative pharmaceutical solutions, including an oral insulin capsule to be used for the treatment of individuals with diabetes, and the use of orally ingestible capsules or pills for delivery of other polypeptides.

&#160;

Oral insulin : We are seeking to revolutionize the treatment of diabetes through our proprietary flagship product, an orally ingestible insulin capsule (ORMD-0801). We completed a Phase IIb clinical trial on 180 type 2 diabetic patients that was conducted in 33 sites in the United States. This double-blind, randomized, 28-day clinical trial was conducted under an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. The clinical trial, designed to assess the safety and efficacy of ORMD-0801, investigated ORMD-0801 over a longer treatment period and had statistical power to give us greater insight into the drug&#8217;s efficacy. The trial was initiated in June 2015, was completed during April 2016 and successfully met its primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints. Prior to that trial, we completed Phase IIa clinical trials in patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We also conducted a glucose clamp study of our oral insulin capsule on type &#160; 1 diabetic volunteers. The glucose clamp is a method for quantifying insulin absorption in order to measure a patient&#8217;s insulin sensitivity and how well a patient metabolizes glucose. The in-life phase was completed in October 2016, and we anticipate receiving the results during the first quarter of calendar year 2017. In October 2016, we initiated an additional Phase IIa dose finding clinical trial on approximately 30 adults type 2 diabetic patients. This trial is being conducted in order to define the optimal dosing of ORMD-0801 moving forward. Our technology allows insulin to travel from the gastrointestinal tract via the portal vein to the bloodstream, revolutionizing the manner in which insulin is delivered. It enables its passage in a more physiological manner than current delivery methods of insulin. Our technology is a platform that has the potential to deliver medications and vaccines orally that today can only be delivered via injection.

&#160;

Oral Glucagon-like peptide-1 : Glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, is an incretin hormone, which is a type of gastrointestinal hormone that stimulates the secretion of insulin from the pancreas. The incretin concept was hypothesized when it was noted that glucose ingested by mouth (oral) stimulated two to three times more insulin release than the same amount of glucose administered intravenously. In addition to stimulating insulin release, GLP-1 was found to suppress glucagon release (hormone involved in regulation of glucose) from the pancreas, slow gastric emptying to reduce the rate of absorption of nutrients into the blood stream, and increase satiety. Other important beneficial attributes of GLP-1 are its effects of increasing the number of beta cells (cells that manufacture and release insulin) in the pancreas and, possibly, protection of the heart. In addition to our flagship product, the insulin capsule, we are using our technology for an orally ingestible GLP-1 capsule (ORMD-0901). In August 2015, we began a non-FDA approved clinical trial for our oral exenatide capsule on type 2 diabetic patients. All follow-up visits of this study were completed during the second quarter of calendar year 2016, and we anticipate the results analysis to be completed during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2016. In June 2016, we also began a pre-clinical toxicology study.

&#160;

Diabetes : Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce or properly use insulin. Insulin is a hormone that causes sugar to be absorbed into cells, where the sugar is converted into energy needed for daily life. The cause of diabetes is attributed both to genetics (type 1 diabetes) and, most often, to environmental factors such as obesity and lack of exercise (type 2 diabetes). According to the International Diabetes Federation, or IDF, an estimated 415 million adults worldwide suffered from diabetes in 2015 and the IDF projects this number will increase to 642 million by 2040. Also, according to the IDF, in 2015, an estimated 5.3 million people died from diabetes. According to the American Diabetes Association, or ADA, in the United States there were approximately 29.1 million people with diabetes, or 9.3% of the United States population in 2015. Diabetes is a leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and amputation.

&#160;

Intellectual property : We own a portfolio of patents and patent applications covering our technologies, and we are aggressively protecting these technology developments on a worldwide basis.

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Management : We are led by a highly-experienced management team knowledgeable in the treatment of diabetes. Our Chief Medical and Technology Officer, Miriam Kidron, PhD, is a world-recognized pharmacologist and a biochemist and the innovator primarily responsible for our oral insulin technology development and know-how.

&#160;

Scientific Advisory Board : Our management team has access to our internationally recognized Scientific Advisory Board whose members are thought-leaders in their respective areas. The Scientific Advisory Board is comprised of Dr. Roy Eldor, Professor Ele Ferrannini, Professor Avram Hershko and Dr. Harold Jacob.

&#160;

Strategy 

&#160;

Short Term Business Strategy 

&#160;

We plan to conduct further research and development on the technology covered by the patent application &#8220;Methods and Composition for Oral Administration of Proteins,&#8221; which we acquired from Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Ltd. in 2006, and which is pending in various foreign jurisdictions, as well as the other patents we have filed in various foreign jurisdictions since then, as discussed below under &#8220;&#8212;Patents and Licenses&#8221; and below under &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; .

&#160;

Through our research and development efforts, we are seeking to develop an oral dosage form that will withstand the harsh chemical environment of the stomach and intestines and will be effective in delivering active insulin or other proteins, such as exenatide, for the treatment of diabetes. The enzymes and vehicles that are added to the proteins in the formulation process must not modify the proteins chemically or biologically, and the dosage form must be safe to ingest. We plan to continue to conduct clinical trials to show the effectiveness of our technology. We originally filed an IND with the FDA in December 2012 for clearance to begin a Phase II clinical trial of ORMD-0801, in order to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of our oral insulin capsule on type 2 diabetic volunteers. Because the identical formulation of ORMD-0801 had not yet been studied in humans at bedtime, in February 2013, the FDA noted concerns about mitigating potential risks of severe hypoglycemia and requested that we perform a sub-study in a controlled in-patient setting for a one-week period prior to beginning the larger multi-centered Phase II trial. As a result, we withdrew the original IND and, in April 2013, we submitted a new IND for the Phase IIa sub-study. Following the FDA&#8217;s clearance to proceed in May 2013, we began the Phase IIa sub-study in July 2013. As we announced in January 2014, the Phase IIa sub-study met all primary and secondary endpoints. Specifically, the Phase IIa study evaluated the pharmacodynamic effects of ORMD-0801 on mean nighttime glucose (determined using a continuous glucose monitor). The results showed that ORMD-0801 exhibited a sound safety profile, led to reduced mean daytime and nighttime glucose readings and lowered fasting blood glucose concentrations, when compared to placebo. In addition, no serious adverse events occurred during this study, and the only adverse events that occurred were not drug related. In light of these results, in June 2015, we initiated the Phase IIb clinical trial on 180 type 2 diabetic patients which was completed in April 2016. This double-blind, randomized, 28-day study clinical trial was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of ORMD-0801, and was conducted in 33 sites in the United States. The trial indicated a statistically significant lowering of glucose relative to placebo across several endpoints. The trial&#8217;s positive topline data showed that the study successfully met its primary efficacy and safety endpoints. The trial primarily evaluated the nighttime glucose lowering effect and safety of ORMD-0801 compared to a placebo. The results of the mean nighttime glucose showed a significant difference in mean change from run-in. ORMD-0801 oral insulin was safe and well-tolerated for the dosing regimen in this trial. The trial further evaluated the effect of ORMD-0801 on mean 24-hour glucose, fasting glucose, and daytime glucose and the results showed a statistically significant difference in mean change from run-in. Two examples of the data gleaned from this study are shown below:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

* Indicates Statistically Significant Difference from Placebo (p-Value&#60;0.05)

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

No significant difference was shown in change in morning fasting serum insulin, C-Peptide, or triglycerides.

&#160; 

Following the significant results of the Phase IIb trial, we initiated in October 2016 an additional Phase IIa, dose finding clinical trial on approximately 30 adult type 2 diabetic patients. This randomized, double-blind trial is being conducted in order to define the optimal dosing of ORMD-0801 moving forward. 

&#160;

In February 2014, we submitted a protocol to the FDA to initiate a Phase IIa trial of our oral insulin capsule for type 1 diabetes volunteers. The protocol was submitted under our existing IND to include both type 1 and type 2 diabetes indications. Beginning in March 2014, the double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, seven-day study design was carried out at an inpatient setting on 25 type 1 diabetic patients. As we announced in October 2014, the results showed that ORMD-0801 oral insulin given before meals appeared to be safe and well-tolerated for the dosing regimen in this study. Although the study was not powered to show statistical significance, there were internally consistent trends observed. Consistent with the timing of administration, the data showed a decrease in rapid acting insulin, a decrease in post-prandial glucose, a decrease in daytime glucose by continual glucose monitoring and an increase in post-prandial hypoglycemia in the active group.

&#160;

We also conducted a glucose clamp study of our oral insulin capsule on type 2 diabetic volunteers that was performed at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. The glucose clamp is a method for quantifying insulin absorption in order to measure a patient&#8217;s insulin sensitivity and how well a patient metabolizes glucose. We completed the in-life phase of the study in October 2016, and anticipate to receive the results during the first quarter of calendar year 2017.

&#160;

Clinical trials are planned in order to substantiate our results as well as for purposes of making future filings for drug approval. We also plan to conduct further research and development by deploying our proprietary drug delivery technology for the delivery of other polypeptides in addition to insulin, and to develop other innovative pharmaceutical products.

&#160;

&#160;

The table below gives an overview of our product pipeline:

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Another component of our business strategy is to partner with other companies or medical institutions in order to further develop our technology and commence pre-commercialization activities. On November 30, 2015, we, our Israeli subsidiary and HTIT entered into a Technology License Agreement, which was further amended, according to which we granted HTIT an exclusive commercialization license in the territory of the People's Republic of China, Macau and Hong Kong, or the Territory, related to our oral insulin capsule, ORMD-0801. Pursuant to this license agreement, HTIT will conduct, at its own expense, certain pre-commercialization and regulatory activities with respect to our technology related to the ORMD-0801 capsule, and will pay certain royalties and an aggregate of approximately $37.5 million (see &#8220;Out-Licensed Technology&#8221; below). We plan to seek additional partnerships or forms of cooperation with other companies or medical institutions. While our strategy is to partner with an appropriate party, no assurance can be given that any third party would be interested in partnering with us. Under certain circumstances, we may determine to develop one or more of our oral dosage form on our own, either world-wide or in select territories.

&#160;

Long Term Business Strategy 

&#160;

If our oral insulin capsule or other drug delivery solutions show significant promise in clinical trials, we plan to ultimately seek a strategic commercial partner, or partners, with extensive experience in the development, commercialization, and marketing of insulin applications and/or other orally digestible drugs. We anticipate such partner or partners would be responsible for, or substantially support, late stage clinical trials (Phase III) to increase the likelihood of obtaining regulatory approvals and registrations in the appropriate markets in a timely manner. We further anticipate that such partner, or partners, would also be responsible for sales and marketing of our oral insulin capsule in these markets. Such planned strategic partnership, or partnerships, may provide a marketing and sales infrastructure for our products as well as financial and operational support for global clinical trials, post marketing studies, label expansions and other regulatory requirements concerning future clinical development in the United States and elsewhere. Any future strategic partner, or partners, may also provide capital and expertise that would enable the partnership to develop new oral dosage form for other polypeptides. While our strategy is to partner with an appropriate party, no assurance can be given that any third party would be interested in partnering with us. Under certain circumstances, we may determine to develop one or more of our oral dosage form on our own, either world-wide or in select territories.

&#160;

Other Planned Strategic Activities 

&#160;

In addition to developing our own oral dosage form drug portfolio, we are, on an on-going basis, considering in-licensing and other means of obtaining additional technologies to complement and/or expand our current product portfolio. Our goal is to create a well-balanced product portfolio that will enhance and complement our existing drug portfolio.

Product Development 

&#160;

Research and Development Summary 

&#160;

We devote the majority of our efforts to research and development, including clinical studies for our lead clinical product candidates, as described below.

&#160;

Orally Ingestible Insulin 

&#160;

During fiscal 2007, we conducted several clinical studies of our orally ingestible insulin that were intended to assess both the safety/tolerability and absorption properties of our proprietary oral insulin. Based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacologic outcomes of these trials, we decided to continue the development of our oral insulin product.

&#160;

During fiscal 2008, we successfully completed animal studies and non-FDA approved clinical trials using our oral insulin capsule, including a Phase Ib clinical trial in healthy human volunteers with the intent of dose optimization; a Phase IIa study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our oral insulin capsule in type 2 diabetic volunteers at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem; and a Phase IIa study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our oral insulin capsule on type 1 diabetic volunteers.

&#160;

Our successful non-FDA clinical trials continued in fiscal 2009, with a Phase IIb study in South Africa to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of our oral insulin capsule on type 2 diabetic volunteers.

&#160;

In September 2010, we reported the successful results of an exploratory clinical trial testing the effectiveness of our oral insulin capsule in type 1 diabetes patients suffering from uncontrolled diabetes. Unstable or labile diabetes is characterized by recurrent, unpredictable and dramatic blood glucose swings often linked with irregular hyperglycemia and sometimes serious hypoglycemia affecting type 1 diabetes patients. This completed exploratory study was a proof of concept study for defining a novel indication for ORMD-0801. We believe the encouraging results justify further clinical development of ORMD-0801 capsule application toward management of uncontrolled diabetes.

&#160;

In March 2011, we reported that we successfully completed a comprehensive toxicity study for our oral insulin capsule. The study was completed under conditions prescribed by the FDA Good Laboratory Practices regulations.

&#160;

As described above, we began FDA-approved clinical trials of ORMD-0801 in July 2013, with the Phase IIa sub-study, which evaluated the pharmacodynamic effects of ORMD-0801 on mean nighttime glucose (determined using a continuous glucose monitor) in volunteers with type 2 diabetes. As we announced in January 2014, the results showed that ORMD-0801 exhibited a sound safety profile, led to reduced mean daytime and nighttime glucose readings and lowered fasting blood glucose concentrations, when compared to placebo.

&#160;

In March 2014, we began an FDA-approved Phase IIa trial of ORMD-0801 in volunteers with type 1 diabetes. As we announced in October 2014, the results showed that ORMD-0801 oral insulin given before meals appeared to be safe and well-tolerated for the dosing regimen in this study. Although the study was not powered to show statistical significance, there were internally consistent trends observed. Consistent with the timing of administration, the data showed a decrease in rapid acting insulin, a decrease in post-prandial glucose, a decrease in daytime glucose by continual glucose monitoring and an increase in post-prandial hypoglycemia in the active group.

&#160;

In April 2015, we began a glucose clamp study of our oral insulin capsule on type 2 diabetic volunteers that was performed at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and University Health System&#8217;s Texas Diabetes Institute. The glucose clamp is a method for quantifying insulin absorption in order to measure a patient&#8217;s insulin sensitivity and how well a patient metabolizes glucose. We completed the in-life phase of the study in October 2016, and anticipate receiving the results during the first quarter of calendar year 2017.

&#160;

In June 2015, we initiated a Phase IIb clinical trial on 180 type 2 diabetic patients, which was completed in April 2016. This double-blind, randomized, 28-day study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of ORMD-0801 and was conducted in 33 sites in the United States. The trial indicated a statistically significant lowering of glucose relative to placebo across several endpoints. The trial successfully met its primary efficacy and safety endpoints and its secondary and exploratory endpoints.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In October 2016, we initiated an additional Phase IIa dose finding clinical trial on approximately 30 adult type 2 diabetic patients. This randomized, double-blind trial is being conducted in order to define the optimal dosing of ORMD-0801 moving forward.

&#160;

We utilize Clinical Research Organizations, or CROs, to conduct our clinical studies. We currently have an agreement with Integrium LLC to act as CRO for the Phase IIa dose finding clinical trial of ORMD-0801 in volunteers having type 2 diabetes, described above.

&#160;

GLP-1 Analog 

&#160;

During fiscal 2009, we completed pre-clinical trials of ORMD-0901, an analog for GLP-1, which included animal studies that suggested that the GLP-1 analog (exenatide-4), when combined with Oramed&#8217;s absorption promoters, is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and retains its biological activity.

&#160;

In December 2009, we completed non-FDA approved clinical trials of an oral GLP-1 analog in healthy, male volunteers conducted at Hadassah University Medical Center in Jerusalem. This study tested the safety and efficacy of ORMD-0901, an encapsulated oral GLP-1 analog formulation. The results of the study indicated that ORMD-0901 was well tolerated by all subjects and demonstrated physiological activity, as extrapolated from ensuing subject insulin levels when compared to those observed after treatment with placebo.

&#160;

In January 2013, we began a clinical trial for our oral exenatide capsule on healthy volunteers and type 2 diabetic patients. Based on this study, we decided to make slight adjustments in the manufacturing of these capsules and have begun pre-toxicology studies on the new capsules.

&#160;

In September 2013, we submitted a pre-IND package to the FDA for ORMD-0901, our oral exenatide capsule, for a Phase II clinical trial on healthy volunteers and type 2 diabetic patients. We began a toxicology study in June 2016 and expect to file an IND and move directly into a large Phase II multi-center trial in the United States. 

&#160;

In August 2015, we began a non-FDA approved clinical trial for our oral exenatide capsule on type 2 diabetic patients. All follow-up visits of this study were completed during the second quarter of calendar year 2016, and we anticipate the results analysis to be completed during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2016.

&#160;

Combination Therapy 

&#160; 

In June 2012, we presented an abstract, which reported the impact of our oral insulin capsule ORMD-0801 delivered in combination with our oral exenatide capsule ORMD-0901. The work that was presented assessed the safety and effectiveness of a combination of oral insulin and oral exenatide treatments delivered to pigs prior to food intake. The drug combination resulted in significantly improved blood glucose regulation when compared to administration of each drug separately.

&#160;

In February 2013, we commenced a first human clinical trial on type 2 diabetic volunteers with our oral insulin capsule delivered in combination with our oral exenatide capsule. In the near term, we are focusing our efforts on the development of the Company&#8217;s flagship products, oral insulin and oral exenatide. Once these two products have progressed further in clinical trials, we intend to conduct additional studies with the oral combination therapy.

&#160;

Feasibility study 

&#160;

In August 2015, we entered into an agreement with a large international pharmaceutical company, or the Pharma Company, pursuant to which we conducted a feasibility study, using one of the Pharma Company's propriety injectable compounds. The study used our proprietary technology in order to deliver the compound orally. Following the successful completion of the first step of the study in July 2016, we continued to the second step of the study. The study will provide data required for decision making on whether to enter into a license agreement between the parties.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Raw Materials 

&#160;

Our oral insulin capsule is currently manufactured by Swiss Caps AG.

&#160;

One of our oral capsule ingredients is being developed and produced by an Indian company.

&#160;

In July 2010, Oramed Ltd. entered into the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, or MSA, with Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GMBH, or Sanofi-Aventis. According to the MSA, Sanofi-Aventis will supply Oramed Ltd. with specified quantities of recombinant human insulin to be used for clinical trials in the United States.

&#160;

We purchase, pursuant to separate agreements with third parties, the raw materials required for the manufacturing of our oral capsule. We generally depend upon a limited number of suppliers for the raw materials. Although alternative sources of supply for these materials are generally available, we could incur significant costs and disruptions if we would need to change suppliers. The termination of our relationships with our suppliers or the failure of these suppliers to meet our requirements for raw materials on a timely and cost-effective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;

Patents and Licenses 

&#160;

We maintain a proactive intellectual property strategy, which includes patent filings in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States and other commercially significant markets. We hold 29 patent applications currently pending, with respect to various compositions, methods of production and oral administration of proteins and exenatide. Expiration dates for pending patents, if granted, will fall between 2026 and 2034.

&#160;

We hold 30 patents, three of which were issued in fiscal 2016, including patents issued by the United States, Swiss, German, French, U.K., Italian, Netherland, Spanish, Australian, Israeli, Japanese, Russian, Canadian, Hong Kong, Chinese, European and Indian patent offices that cover a part of our technology, which allows for the oral delivery of proteins and patents issued by the Australian, Israeli, New Zealand, South African and Russian patent offices that cover part of our technology for the oral delivery of exenatide.

&#160;

Consistent with our strategy to seek protection in key markets worldwide, we have been and will continue to pursue the patent applications and corresponding foreign counterparts of such applications. We believe that our success will depend on our ability to obtain patent protection for our intellectual property.

&#160;

Our patent strategy is as follows:

&#160;

Aggressively protect all current and future technological developments to assure strong and broad protection by filing patents and/or continuations in part as appropriate,

&#160;

Protect technological developments at various levels, in a complementary manner, including the base technology, as well as specific applications of the technology, and

&#160;

Establish comprehensive coverage in the United States and in all relevant foreign markets in anticipation of future commercialization opportunities.

&#160;

We also rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. Our policy is to require our employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers, our board of directors, or our Board, technical review board and other advisors, to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual&#8217;s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. We also require signed confidentiality or material transfer agreements from any company that is to receive our confidential information. In the case of employees, consultants and contractors, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of our Company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.

Out-Licensed Technology 

&#160;

In June 2010, Oramed Ltd. entered into a joint venture agreement with D.N.A Biomedical Solutions Ltd., or D.N.A, for the establishment of Entera Bio LTD, or Entera.

&#160;

Under the terms of a license agreement that was entered into between Oramed Ltd. and Entera in August 2010, we out-licensed technology to Entera, on an exclusive basis, for the development of oral delivery drugs for certain indications to be agreed upon between the parties. The out-licensed technology differs from our main delivery technology that is used for oral insulin and GLP-1 analog and is subject to different patent applications. Entera&#8217;s initial development effort is for an oral formulation for the treatment of osteoporosis. In March 2011, we entered into a patent transfer agreement to replace the original license agreement upon closing pursuant to which Oramed Ltd. assigned to Entera all of its right, title and interest in and to the patent application that it had licensed to Entera in August 2010. Under this agreement, Oramed Ltd. is entitled to receive from Entera royalties of 3% of Entera&#8217;s net revenues (as defined in the agreement) and a license back of that patent application for use in respect of diabetes and influenza.

&#160;

In March 2011, we also consummated a transaction with D.N.A, whereby we sold to D.N.A 47% of Entera&#8217;s outstanding share capital on an undiluted basis. As consideration for the Entera shares, we received consideration of cash and ordinary shares of D.N.A, having an aggregate value of approximately $1,032,000 as of March 31, 2011. The promissory note was secured by a personal guarantee of the D.N.A majority shareholders and its term was extended in August 2011. D.N.A paid off the promissory note in November 2011. The market price for D.N.A&#8217;s ordinary shares is subject to market fluctuations and may, at times, have a price below the value on the date we acquired such shares. The closing price for D.N.A&#8217;s ordinary shares was $0.068 per share on November 22, 2016. In addition, the ordinary shares of D.N.A have historically experienced low trading volume; as a result there is no guarantee that we will be able to resell the ordinary shares of D.N.A at the prevailing market prices. In addition, D.N.A invested $250,000 in our private placement investment round, which closed in March 2011, for which it received 65,105 shares of our common stock and five-year warrants to purchase 22,787 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $6.00 per share.

&#160;

D.N.A consummated a reverse stock split at a ratio of one-for-two, effective October 4, 2015, and unless otherwise indicated, share amounts of D.N.A included in this Form 10-K have been adjusted to reflect the effects of the reverse stock split.

&#160;

In October 2012, as part of a securities purchase agreement with D.N.A, we received the option to purchase up to 10,818,806 ordinary shares of D.N.A, valued at approximately $629,000 at the day of the transaction, and we exercised the option in February 2013.

&#160;

Through August 31, 2016, we sold a total of 4,812,995 shares for total consideration of $364,000, and as of August 31, 2016, we held 10,208,144 shares.

&#160;

In June 2016, Entera announced that it had obtained orphan status from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for its oral treatment for hypoparathyroidism. EMA approval is in addition to the orphan status it obtained from the FDA for the same oral treatment in April 2014.

&#160;

In July 2015, Entera announced it had completed a phase 2a study to assess the safety and efficacy of its oral treatment for hypoparathyroidism and that the goals of the study were achieved.

&#160;

On November 30, 2015, we, our Israeli subsidiary and HTIT entered into a Technology License Agreement, and on December 21, 2015 these parties entered into an Amended and Restated Technology License Agreement that was further amended by the parties on June 3, 2016 and July 24, 2016, or the License Agreement. According to the License Agreement, we granted HTIT an exclusive commercialization license in the Territory, related to our oral insulin capsule, ORMD-0801. Pursuant to the License Agreement, HTIT will conduct, at its own expense, certain pre-commercialization and regulatory activities with respect to our technology and ORMD-0801 capsule, and will pay (i) royalties of 10% on net sales of the related commercialized products to be sold by HTIT in the Territory, or Royalties, and (ii) an aggregate of approximately $37.5 million, of which $3 million is payable immediately, $8 million will be paid in near term installments subject to our entry into certain agreements with certain third parties, and $26.5 million will be payable upon achievement of certain milestones and conditions. In the event that we will not meet certain conditions, the Royalties rate may be reduced to a minimum of 8%. Following the expiration of our patents covering the technology in the Territory, the Royalties rate may be reduced, under certain circumstances, to 5%. The initial payment of $3 million was received in January 2016. Following achievement of certain milestones, the second and third milestone payments of $6.5 million and $4 million, respectively, were received in July 2016 and the fourth milestone payment of $4 million was received in October 2016.

We also entered into a separate securities purchase agreement with HTIT, or the SPA, pursuant to which HTIT invested $12 million in us in December 2015 (see &#8211; &#8220;Liquidity and capital resources&#8221; below). In connection with the License Agreement and the SPA, we received a non-refundable payment of $500,000 as a no-shop fee.

Government Regulation 

&#160;

The Drug Development Process 

&#160;

Regulatory requirements for the approval of new drugs vary from one country to another. In order to obtain approval to market our drug portfolio, we need to go through a different regulatory process in each country in which we apply for such approval. In some cases information gathered during the approval process in one country can be used as supporting information for the approval process in another country. As a strategic decision, we decided to first explore the FDA regulatory pathway. The following is a summary of the FDA&#8217;s requirements.

&#160;

The FDA requires that pharmaceutical and certain other therapeutic products undergo significant clinical experimentation and clinical testing prior to their marketing or introduction to the general public. Clinical testing, known as clinical trials or clinical studies, is either conducted internally by life science, pharmaceutical, or biotechnology companies or is conducted on behalf of these companies by CROs.

&#160;

The process of conducting clinical studies is highly regulated by the FDA, as well as by other governmental and professional bodies. Below we describe the principal framework in which clinical studies are conducted, as well as describe a number of the parties involved in these studies.

&#160;

Protocols. Before commencing human clinical studies, the sponsor of a new drug or therapeutic product must submit an IND application to the FDA. The application contains, among other documents, what is known in the industry as a protocol. A protocol is the blueprint for each drug study. The protocol sets forth, among other things, the following:

&#160;

&#9679; Who must be recruited as qualified participants, &#160;

&#9679; How often to administer the drug or product, &#160;

&#9679; What tests to perform on the participants, and &#160;

&#9679; What dosage of the drug or amount of the product to give to the participants. &#160;

Institutional Review Board. An institutional review board is an independent committee of professionals and lay persons which reviews clinical research studies involving human beings and is required to adhere to guidelines issued by the FDA. The institutional review board does not report to the FDA, but its records are audited by the FDA. Its members are not appointed by the FDA. All clinical studies must be approved by an institutional review board. The institutional review board&#8217;s role is to protect the rights of the participants in the clinical studies. It approves the protocols to be used, the advertisements which the company or CRO conducting the study proposes to use to recruit participants, and the form of consent which the participants will be required to sign prior to their participation in the clinical studies.

&#160;

Clinical Trials. Human clinical studies or testing of a potential product are generally done in three stages known as Phase I through Phase III testing. The names of the phases are derived from the regulations of the FDA. Generally, there are multiple studies conducted in each phase.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Phase I. Phase I studies involve testing a drug or product on a limited number of healthy or patients participants, typically 24 to 100 people at a time. Phase I studies determine a product&#8217;s basic safety and how the product is absorbed by, and eliminated from, the body. This phase lasts an average of six months to a year.

&#160;

Phase II. Phase II trials involve testing of no more than 300 participants at a time who may suffer from the targeted disease or condition. Phase II testing typically lasts an average of one to two years. In Phase II, the drug is tested to determine its safety and effectiveness for treating a specific illness or condition. Phase II testing also involves determining acceptable dosage levels of the drug. Phase II studies may be split into Phase IIa and Phase IIb sub-studies. Phase IIa studies may be conducted with patient volunteers and are exploratory (non-pivotal) studies, typically designed to evaluate clinical efficacy or biological activity. Phase IIb studies are conducted with patients defined to evaluate definite dose range and evaluate efficacy. If Phase II studies show that a new drug has an acceptable range of safety risks and probable effectiveness, a company will generally continue to review the substance in Phase III studies.

&#160;

Phase III. Phase III studies involve testing large numbers of participants, typically several hundred to several thousand persons. The purpose is to verify effectiveness and long-term safety on a large scale. These studies generally last two to three years. Phase III studies are conducted at multiple locations or sites. Like the other phases, Phase III requires the site to keep detailed records of data collected and procedures performed.

&#160;

New Drug Approval. The results of the clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a new drug application, or NDA. Following the completion of Phase III studies, assuming the sponsor of a potential product in the United States believes it has sufficient information to support the safety and effectiveness of its product, the sponsor will generally submit an NDA to the FDA requesting that the product be approved for marketing. The application is a comprehensive, multi-volume filing that includes the results of all clinical studies, information about the drug&#8217;s composition, and the sponsor&#8217;s plans for producing, packaging and labeling the product. The FDA&#8217;s review of an application can take a few months to many years, with the average review lasting 18 months. Once approved, drugs and other products may be marketed in the United States, subject to any conditions imposed by the FDA.

&#160;

Phase IV. The FDA may require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials following new drug approval. The purpose of these trials, known as Phase IV studies, is to monitor long-term risks and benefits, study different dosage levels or evaluate safety and effectiveness. In recent years, the FDA has increased its reliance on these trials. Phase IV studies usually involve thousands of participants. Phase IV studies also may be initiated by the company sponsoring the new drug to gain broader market value for an approved drug.

&#160;

The drug approval process is time-consuming, involves substantial expenditures of resources, and depends upon a number of factors, including the severity of the illness in question, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in the clinical trials.

&#160;

Other Regulations 

&#160;

Various federal, state and local laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, the environment and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export, use, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research are applicable to our activities. They include, among others, the U.S. Atomic Energy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and Resources Conservation and Recovery Act, national restrictions on technology transfer, import, export, and customs regulations, and other present and possible future local, state, or federal regulation. The compliance with these and other laws, regulations and recommendations can be time-consuming and involve substantial costs. In addition, the extent of governmental regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Competition 

&#160;

Competition in General 

&#160;

Competition in the area of biomedical and pharmaceutical research and development is intense and significantly depends on scientific and technological factors. These factors include the availability of patent and other protection for technology and products, the ability to commercialize technological developments and the ability to obtain regulatory approval for testing, manufacturing and marketing. Our competitors include major pharmaceutical, medical products, chemical and specialized biotechnology companies, many of which have financial, technical and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, many biotechnology companies have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or through joint ventures. We are aware of certain other products manufactured or under development by competitors that are used for the treatment of the diseases and health conditions that we have targeted for product development. We can provide no assurance that developments by others will not render our technology obsolete or noncompetitive, that we will be able to keep pace with new technological developments or that our technology will be able to supplant established products and methodologies in the therapeutic areas that are targeted by us. The foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. These companies, as well as academic institutions, governmental agencies and private research organizations, also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants.

&#160;

Competition within our sector is increasing, so we will encounter competition from existing firms that offer competitive solutions in diabetes treatment solutions. These competitive companies could develop products that are superior to, or have greater market acceptance, than the products being developed by us. We will have to compete against other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with greater market recognition and greater financial, marketing and other resources.

&#160;

Our competition will be determined in part by the potential indications for which our technology is developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. In addition, the first product to reach the market in a therapeutic or preventive area is often at a significant competitive advantage relative to later entrants to the market. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we, or our potential corporate partners, can develop products, complete the clinical trials and approval processes and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market are expected to be important competitive factors. Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop effective proprietary products, develop and implement production and marketing plans, obtain and maintain patent protection and secure adequate capital resources. We expect our technology, if approved for sale, to compete primarily on the basis of product efficacy, safety, patient convenience, reliability, value and patent position.

&#160;

Competition for Our Oral Insulin Capsule 

&#160;

We anticipate the oral insulin capsule to be a competitive diabetes drug because of its anticipated efficacy and safety profile. The following are treatment options for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Insulin injections, &#160;

&#160; &#9679; Insulin pumps, or &#160;

&#160; &#9679; A combination of diet, exercise and oral medication which improve the body&#8217;s response to insulin or cause the body to produce more insulin. &#160;

Several entities who are actively developing oral insulin capsules and/or alternatives to insulin are thought to be: Novo Nordisk (Denmark), Biocon Limited (India) and Midatech (UK).

&#160;

Scientific Advisory Board 

&#160;

We maintain a Scientific Advisory Board consisting of internationally recognized scientists who advise us on scientific and technical aspects of our business. The Scientific Advisory Board meets periodically to review specific projects and to assess the value of new technologies and developments to us. In addition, individual members of the Scientific Advisory Board meet with us periodically to provide advice in their particular areas of expertise. The Scientific Advisory Board consists of the following members, information with respect to whom is set forth below: Dr. Roy Eldor, Professor Ele Ferrannini, Professor Avram Hershko and Dr. Harold Jacob.

&#160;

He has published over 500 original papers and 50 book chapters and he is a &#8220;highly cited researcher,&#8221; according to the Institute for Scientific Information.

&#160;

Professor Avram Hershko, MD, PhD , joined the Oramed Scientific Advisory Board in July 2008. He earned his MD degree (1965) and PhD degree (1969) from the Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School of Jerusalem. Professor Hershko served as a physician in the Israel Defense Forces from 1965 to 1967. After a post-doctoral fellowship with Gordon Tomkins at the University of San Francisco (1969 - 72), he joined the faculty of the Haifa Technion becoming a professor in 1980. He is now Distinguished Professor in the Unit of Biochemistry in the B. Rappaport Faculty of Medicine of the Technion. Professor Hershko&#8217;s main research interests concern the mechanisms by which cellular proteins are degraded, a formerly neglected field of study. Professor Hershko and his colleagues showed that cellular proteins are degraded by a highly selective proteolytic system. This system tags proteins for destruction by linkage to a protein called ubiquitin, which had previously been identified in many tissues, but whose function was previously unknown. Subsequent work by Professor Hershko and many other laboratories has shown that the ubiquitin system has a vital role in controlling a wide range of cellular processes, such as the regulation of cell division, signal transduction and DNA repair. Professor Hershko was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (2004) jointly with his former PhD student Aaron Ciechanover and their colleague Irwin Rose. His many honors include the Israel Prize for Biochemistry (1994), the Gairdner Award (1999), the Lasker Prize for Basic Medical Research (2000), the Wolf Prize for Medicine (2001) and the Louisa Gross Horwitz Award (2001). Professor Hershko is a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences (2000) and a Foreign Associate of the U.S. Academy of Sciences (2003).
