Overview

&#160;

For more than the past six years, we have been focused exclusively on efforts to develop a business centered around the commercial manufacturing of pure lithium metal, a raw material for use in lightweight, high energy density batteries, in an environmentally friendly manner. Lithium is the lightest of all metals, and has the highest electrochemical potential, making lithium the clear raw material of choice for batteries. There is a substantial existing market for lithium metal in primary (non-rechargeable) batteries, and future opportunities exist for next generation batteries under development.

&#160;

Commencing in October 2010, working through a third party, we conducted a series of tests to determine if the process worked and, based on the results, initially believed that the process was workable, however it did not prove to be commercially feasible and R&#38;D efforts involving this license were abandoned.

&#160;

In June 2013, we filed a new patent for a proprietary room temperature process titled &#8220;Producing Lithium&#8221; and we are currently focusing all of our business efforts on this new technology.

&#160;

alpha-En&#8217;s Proposed Process

&#160;

Based on results to date, including what we believe to be multiple validations of the proof of process from independent laboratories, we believe that our proprietary technology offers a number of advantages over lithium extraction techniques currently in use. Traditionally, industrial production of lithium metal involved the electrolysis of molten salts at temperatures of 400&#176;-600&#176; Celsius (752&#176;-1112&#176; Fahrenheit). Maintaining these salts at high heat levels adds meaningful production costs to the process. Mercury is also used in the process, in quantities not legal in the US.

&#160;

Our proprietary technology allows for processing at room temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, without the use of mercury, and allows for the use of lithium carbonate as a primary feed stock. The advantages are:

&#160;

&#183; lower process temperatures and electrical efficiency mean lower manufacturing costs; &#160;

&#183; environmental risks, containment costs and costly regulations are reduced by the absence of toxic mercury; &#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; lithium carbonate can be used as the feed stock, reducing raw material and overall manufacturing costs, and eliminating the hazardous by-products typically produced when processing halide salts of lithium; &#160;

&#183; the process offers flexible dendrite free deposition on a myriad of different substrates in custom form factors; and &#160;

&#183; lithium is free of impurities and trace metals, and we believe is the material of choice for advanced batteries. &#160;

In 2012 and 2013, we devoted our resources to refining our technology to manufacture lithium metal, from the lab bench to the manufacturing floor. We believe that we have advanced the state of this technology and are taking preliminary steps in order to begin manufacturing the product. To achieve this end, however, additional funds will need to be raised, as to which there can be no assurance.

&#160;

In July 2013, we filed a patent application titled &#34;Producing Lithium,&#34; based on our proprietary room temperature, flexible and energy efficient process. This proprietary process uses low grade lithium carbonate as a feedstock, and does not require mercury or release toxic materials such as chlorine gas. This patent application is pending.

&#160;

Currently, we are attempting to further implement our business plan, develop IP associated with our core technology, and broaden our patent portfolio, and generate sufficient revenue; however, our cash position may not be sufficient to support our daily operations. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to further implement our business plan and generate sufficient revenue and in our ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering, there can be no assurance to that effect. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan and generate sufficient revenue and our ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering.

Corporate Information and Development

&#160;

alpha-En Corporation is a Delaware corporation. From 1969 to September 1996, operating as Wombat Productions, our primary focus was the production of one-hour profiles of Hollywood stars. In September 1996, we sold this business to former management and changed our name to Avenue Entertainment Group, Inc. From September 1996 to September 2005, we were an independent entertainment company that produced feature films, television films and made-for-television/cable movies.

&#160;

Our company cut back daily operations in late 2005 and essentially ceased daily operations in May 2006. From May 2006 through the date we entered into a Technology License Agreement in February 2009, we were substantially inactive. All monies disbursed by us from 2006 through January 2009 were used to pay previously-incurred accounting fees and for the payment of directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; insurance premiums. During that period, we had no employees and our board of directors did not meet.

&#160;

On April 30, 2008, our board of directors and stockholders owning a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted to approve an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to (a) change our corporate name to alpha-En Corporation, and (b) increase the aggregate number of our authorized shares of common stock from 15,000,000 shares to 35,000,000 shares. On June 9, 2008, we filed the certificate of amendment to our certificate of incorporation, effecting these changes. Pursuant to the corporate name change, effective July 22, 2008, our company&#8217;s trading symbol was changed to &#8220;ALPE.&#8221;

&#160;

On February 25, 2009, we were granted an exclusive, worldwide, transferable, perpetual license to use certain proprietary technology for the processing of lithium for use in batteries and other fields, which technology was deemed not commercially viable and is no longer used by us. In exchange for the license, we had certain financial, share issuance and royalty obligations if certain sale thresholds were met. However, since such thresholds were not met, we are currently negotiating a settlement of the license. There can be no assurance that a settlement will be consummated.

The license had been recorded at its fair value of $250,000 based on management&#8217;s projected net cash flows to be realized from sales of products under the license. As of December 31, 2011, we had evaluated the fair value of the license intangible asset and determined that it is in excess of the carrying value based on the estimated net discounted cash flows anticipated from the sale of the process under the license. We recorded an impairment of $250,000 at December 31, 2011. Pursuant to the terms of the license, the additional 2,000,000 shares of our common stock, which were subject to forfeiture if there had not been at least $1,000,000 in total commercial sales of licenses products by February 25, 2012. As of February 25, 2012, commercial sales of the licensed products had not commenced.

&#160;

On September 17, 2014, we formed Clean Lithium Corporation, a New York corporation, as a current majority owned subsidiary. On October 13, 2014, we sold 150,000 shares of common stock of Clean Lithium Corporation to an unaffiliated investor for $150,000.

&#160;

On July 30, 2015, we executed a Stock Purchase and Warrant Grant Agreement with an individual for the sale of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase 1,000,000 shares of our common stock, and the sale of 300,000 shares of our subsidiary, Clean Lithium Corporation. The warrant is exercisable at $0.20 per share expiring five years from the closing date. The purchase price of $1,000,000 was agreed to be (i) $650,000 for our common stock, (ii) $300,000 for the Clean Lithium Corporation common stock and (iii) $50,000 for the warrant to purchase shares of our common stock. We received the first $500,000 on September 3, 2015 and the second $500,000 on October 19, 2015.
