 Item 1. 

Business

General 

&#160;

Inland Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (which we refer to herein as the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) was incorporated on August 24, 2011 as a Maryland corporation. We were formed to acquire, directly or indirectly, a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate located throughout the United States. We are permitted to acquire retail properties, office buildings, multi-family properties and industrial/distribution and warehouse facilities. To date, we have focused on acquiring retail properties. We may acquire these properties directly or through joint ventures. We also may invest in real estate-related equity securities as well as commercial mortgage-backed securities. Our sponsor, Inland Real Estate Investment Corporation, referred to herein as our &#8220;Sponsor&#8221; or &#8220;IREIC,&#8221; is an indirect subsidiary of The Inland Group, Inc. Various affiliates of our Sponsor are involved in our business. We are externally managed and advised by IREIT Business Manager &#38; Advisor, Inc., referred to herein as our &#8220;Business Manager,&#8221; an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of our Sponsor. Our Business Manager is responsible for overseeing and managing our day-to-day operations. Our properties are managed by Inland National Real Estate Services, LLC and, subsequent to the end of the year, are being managed by Inland Commercial Real Estate Services LLC, referred to herein as our &#8220;Real Estate Managers,&#8221; indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of our Sponsor.

On October 18, 2012, we commenced our initial public offering, referred to herein as the &#8220;Offering,&#8221; and it concluded on October 16, 2015. We offered 150,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $10.00 per share on a &#8220;best efforts&#8221; basis through Inland Securities Corporation, or &#8220;Inland Securities,&#8221; our dealer manager, a wholly owned subsidiary of our Sponsor. &#8220;Best efforts&#8221; means that Inland Securities was not obligated to purchase any specific number or dollar amount of shares. We also offered up to 30,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $9.50 per share to stockholders who elected to participate in our distribution reinvestment plan (as amended, the &#8220;DRP&#8221;). We subsequently filed a new Registration Statement pursuant to which we are offering up to 25,000,000 shares of our common stock to existing stockholders who elect to participate in the DRP.

At December 31, 2015, we owned 54 retail properties, totaling approximately 6.0 million square feet. At December 31, 2015, our portfolio had weighted average physical and economic occupancy of 96.2% and 97.2%, respectively. Economic occupancy excludes square footage that we own but which is not occupied by a tenant and which is subject to an earnout component on the original purchase price. Specifically, at the time of acquisition, in some cases, a portion of the purchase price was contingent on the seller leasing certain vacant space by certain applicable times. We are not obligated to pay this contingent purchase price unless the seller obtains leases for the vacant space within the time limits and parameters set forth in the acquisition agreement. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, annualized base rent (&#8220;ABR&#8221;) per square foot averaged $17.05 and $14.48, respectively, for all properties owned. ABR is calculated by annualizing the current, in place monthly base rent for leases, including any tenant concessions, such as rent abatement or allowances, which may have been granted and excluding ground leases. ABR including ground leases averaged $14.90 and $13.08, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

We provide the following programs to facilitate additional investment in our shares and to provide limited liquidity for stockholders.

Distribution Reinvestment Plan

We provide existing stockholders with the option to purchase additional shares from us by automatically reinvesting cash distributions through the DRP, subject to certain share ownership restrictions. We do not pay any selling commissions or a marketing contribution and due diligence expense allowance in connection with the DRP. Shares are sold at a price equal to $9.50 per share until such time as we report an estimated value of our shares (the &#8220;Valuation Date&#8221;). On and after the Valuation Date, the price per share under the DRP will be equal to the estimated value of a share, as determined by our board of directors and reported by us from time to time. We intend to publish an estimated value of our shares no later than April 2016.

Distributions reinvested through the DRP were approximately $20.8 million, $5.4 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Share Repurchase Program

Under the share repurchase program (&#8220;SRP&#8221;), we are authorized to purchase shares from stockholders who purchased their shares from us or received their shares through a non-cash transfer and who have held their shares for at least one year, if requested, if we choose to repurchase them. Subject to funds being available, we limit the number of shares repurchased during any calendar year to 5% of the number of shares outstanding on December 31 st of the previous calendar year. Funding for the SRP comes from proceeds we receive from the DRP. In the case of repurchases made because of the death of a stockholder or qualifying disability, as defined in the SRP, neither the one year holding period, the limit regarding funds available from the DRP nor the 5% limit applies. The SRP will 

&#160;

immediately termi nate if our shares become listed for trading on a national securities exchange. In addition, our board of directors, in its sole direction, may, at any time, amend, suspend or terminate the SRP. 

Pursuant to the SRP, we may repurchase shares at prices ranging from 92.5% of the &#8220;share price,&#8221; as defined in the SRP, for stockholders who have owned shares for at least one year to 100% of the &#8220;share price&#8221; for stockholders who have owned shares for at least four years. For repurchases sought upon a stockholder&#8217;s death or qualifying disability, we may repurchase shares at a price equal to 100% of the &#8220;share price.&#8221; As used in the SRP, &#8220;share price&#8221; means: (1) prior to the Valuation Date, the offering price of our shares in our Offering (unless the shares were purchased at a discount from that price, and then that purchase price), reduced by any distributions of net sale proceeds that we designate as constituting a return of capital; and (2) on and after the Valuation Date, the lesser of: (A) the share price determined in (1); or (B) the most recently disclosed estimated value per share.

Repurchases through the SRP were approximately $3.8 million, $0.3 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Segment Data 

We currently view our real estate portfolio as one business segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;). Accordingly, we did not report any other segment disclosure for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Information related to our business segment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is set forth in Note 10 &#8211; &#8220;Segment Reporting&#8221; to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Tax Status 

We have elected to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) for federal income tax purposes under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Internal Revenue Code&#8221;), beginning with the tax year ended December 31, 2013. Because we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that is distributed to stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, without the benefit of certain relief provisions, we will be subject to federal (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income, property or net worth, respectively, and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. 

Competition 

The commercial real estate market is highly competitive. We compete in all of our markets with other owners and operators of commercial properties. We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property&#8217;s design to tenants&#8217; needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on a property&#8217;s occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses.

We are subject to significant competition in seeking real estate investments and tenants. We compete with many third parties engaged in real estate investment activities including other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, hedge funds, governmental bodies and other entities. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater financial resources than we do and generally enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. 

Employees

We do not have any employees. In addition, all of our executive officers are officers of IREIC or one or more of its affiliates and are compensated by those entities, in part, for their services rendered to us. We neither separately compensate our executive officers for their service as officers, nor do we reimburse either our Business Manager or Real Estate Managers for any compensation paid to individuals who also serve as our executive officers, or the executive officers of our Business Manager or its affiliates or our Real Estate Managers; provided that, for these purposes, the corporate secretaries of our Company and the Business Manager are not considered &#8220;executive officers.&#8221; 

Conflicts of Interest 

Certain persons performing services for our Business Manager and Real Estate Managers are employees of IREIC or its affiliates, and may also perform services for its affiliates and other IREIC-sponsored entities. These individuals face competing demands for their 

&#160;

time and services and may have conflicts in allocating their time between our business and assets and the business and assets of these other entities. IREIC also may face a conflict of interest in allocating personnel and resources among these entities. In addition, conflicts exist to the extent that we acquire properties in the same geographic areas where properties owned by other IREIC-sponsored programs are located. In these cases, a conflict may arise in the acquisitio n or leasing of properties if we and another IREIC-sponsored program are competing for the same properties or tenants in negotiating leases, or a conflict may arise in connection with the resale of properties if we and another IREIC-sponsored program are s elling similar properties at the same time. 

Our charter contains provisions setting forth our ability to engage in certain related party transactions. Our board of directors reviews all of these transactions and, as a general rule, any related party transactions must be approved by a majority of the directors, including a majority of the independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction. Further, we may not engage in certain transactions with entities sponsored by, or affiliated with, IREIC unless a majority of our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors, finds the transaction to be fair and reasonable and on terms no less favorable to us than those from an unaffiliated party under the same circumstances. Our board has adopted a conflicts of interest policy prohibiting us from engaging in the following types of transactions with IREIC-affiliated entities: 

&#160;

&#183; 

purchasing real estate assets from, or selling real estate assets to, any IREIC-affiliated entities (excluding circumstances where an entity affiliated with IREIC, such as Inland Real Estate Acquisitions, Inc. (&#8220;IREA&#8221;), who from time to time may enter into a purchase agreement to acquire a property and then assign the purchase agreement to us); 

&#160;

&#183; 

making loans to, or borrowing money from, any IREIC-affiliated entities (this excludes expense advancements under existing agreements and the deposit of monies in any banking institution affiliated with IREIC); and 

&#160;

&#183; 

investing in joint ventures with any IREIC-affiliated entities. 

This policy does not impact agreements or relationships between us and IREIC and its affiliates, including, for example, agreements with our Business Manager or Real Estate Managers that relate to the day-to-day management of our business. 

Environmental Matters 

As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws, rules and regulations adopted by various governmental bodies or agencies. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions. We do not believe that our existing portfolio as of December 31, 2015 will require us to incur material expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations.
