 Item 1. Business &#160; 

Background 

&#160;

Aqua Metals, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation on June 20, 2014 for the purpose of engaging in the business of recycling lead through a novel, proprietary and patent-pending process that we developed and named &#8220;AquaRefining&#8221;. Since our formation, we have focused our efforts on the further development of our AquaRefining process, establishment of strategic relationships and the pursuit of additional working capital. We have not commenced revenue-producing operations and, under our current plan of business, do not expect to do so until the second quarter of 2016. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms &#8220;Aqua Metals&#8221;, &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Aqua Metals, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

&#160;

All references in this report to &#8220;ton&#8221; or &#8220;tonne&#8221; refer to a metric ton, which is equal to approximately 2,204.6 pounds.

&#160;

Since our organization in 2014, we have engaged in several capital raising transactions, which are summarized below in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; General.&#8221;

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

We are engaged in the business of recycling lead through a novel, proprietary and patent-pending process that we developed and named &#8220;AquaRefining&#8221;. Lead is a globally traded commodity with a worldwide market value in excess of $20 billion. Lead acid batteries, or LABs, are the primary use of all lead produced in the world. Because the chemical properties of lead allow it to be recycled and reused indefinitely, LABs are also the primary source of all lead production. As such, LABs are almost 100% recycled for purposes of capturing the lead contained therein for re-use. We believe that our proprietary AquaRefining process will provide for the recycling of LABs and the production of a pure grade lead with a significantly lower cost of production, and with fewer environmental and regulatory issues, than conventional methods of lead production.

&#160;

In recent years, many lead mines have become exhausted and recycled lead has become increasingly important to LAB production. Recycled lead surpassed mined lead in the 1990s and now represents more than 50% of the lead content in new LABs. Whether it is produced from lead ore or recycled LABs, lead has historically been produced by smelting. Smelting is a high-temperature, endothermic chemical reduction, making it inefficient, energy intensive and often a highly pollutive process. As a consequence of its environmental and health issues, lead smelting has become increasingly regulated in developed countries. In the US, regulatory non-compliance has forced the closure of large high-capacity lead smelters in Vernon, California, Frisco, Texas and Herculaneum, Missouri over the last three years. Herculaneum was the last remaining primary lead-mine operation (i.e., smelting lead from ore) in the US, though secondary lead smelters that process recycled lead continue to operate in the US. In response, there has been an expansion of LAB smelting capacity in Mexico and other less regulated countries. The resulting transportation of used LABs from where they originate in the US to smelters in Mexico, the Philippines and elsewhere is an increasingly significant logistical and global environmental cost. 

&#160;

AquaRefining uses an aqueous solvent and a novel electro-chemical process to produce pure lead (i.e., higher than 99.99% purity). We believe that AquaRefining can significantly reduce production costs as compared with alternative methods of producing pure lead. This cost reduction is partly because our novel electro-chemical process requires less energy than the endothermic high temperature (1700&#176;F) chemical reduction that is at the core of smelting. It is also partly because our process does not generate toxic high temperature dust and gas, or the lead containing slag and dross that are unavoidable byproducts of smelting, and which require capital and energy intensive processes to meet environmental compliance. We also have the potential to locate multiple smaller recycling facilities in areas closer to the source of used LABs, thereby reducing transport costs and supply chain bottlenecks. AquaRefining is a water-based ambient temperature process. On this basis, we believe that it significantly reduces environmental emissions, health concerns and permitting needs as compared with lead smelting. We believe that the combined advantages offered by AquaRefining represent a potential step change in lead recycling technology, one that can deliver advantages in economics, footprint and logistics while greatly reducing the environmental impact of lead recycling.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The modular nature of AquaRefining makes it possible to start LAB recycling at a much smaller scale than is possible with smelters, thereby significantly reducing the investment risk associated with building a lead production facility. Our plan is to actively explore distributed recycling in the US by establishing our own initial recycling operation near Reno, Nevada. This plan is based on our belief that Reno has become a significant hub of the West Coast&#8217;s LAB distribution infrastructure and yet is very poorly served by the LAB recycling industry. From our initial recycling facility near Reno, we intend to expand first throughout the US and then overseas. We will seek to own our own recycling facilities but will also evaluate joint ventures, licensing and direct sales.

&#160; 

Our Markets 

&#160; 

The Lead Market 

&#160;

Lead is a globally traded commodity and the essential component of over 95% of the world&#8217;s rechargeable batteries. Lead is traded primarily on the London Metals Exchange, or LME. Conventionally, there are two separate categories of lead: 1) primary lead which refers to lead mined and refined from lead ore bodies consisting of galena, or lead sulfide, and 2) secondary lead which refers to lead recovered by recycling and which has a lower purity. 

&#160;

Originally, a majority of the lead used in batteries was primary but in recent decades secondary lead has grown to become the majority of the lead used. Industry data shows that six million metric tons of lead was produced in 1995 of which approximately 45% was primary and 55% was secondary (recycled). Twenty years later, by 2015, global lead production had increased to approximately 11 million metric tons, of which more than 70% was secondary. Importantly primary lead production had increased only marginally during this period. This marginal increase is because mined ore deposits (galena) are becoming worked-out. As such, an increasing quantity of primary lead is now a byproduct of copper and zinc mining. Importantly, lead produced from copper and zinc rich ore is much less pure than lead produced from galena and requires additional energy intensive processing before it meets the quality required to be sold as primary lead. This has resulted in an increasing demand for secondary lead which meets the purity of lead conventionally mined from galena.

&#160;

In 2005, secondary lead traded on the LME in a range of $1,000 to $1,200 per metric ton. During 2014, secondary lead traded at $2,000 to $2,400 per metric ton. During the second half of 2015, secondary lead dropped to a trading range of $1,600 to $1,800 per metric ton as the price of all commodities declined globally.

&#160;

As noted above, lead is traded as a commodity on the LME, however it is also traded directly between producers and users, with LME pricing for primary and secondary lead forming the basis of physical trades, forward contracts and hedge strategies. Based on our discussions with buyers of lead in the US lead market, different grades of lead are traded in the US at a discount or premium to the LME price substantially as follows:

&#160;

&#8226; Secondary lead is traded at the LME spot price; &#160;

&#8226; Lead equivalent in purity to conventional primary lead is traded at 10-21% over LME (+8 to +16 cents per lb. or $176&#8211;352 per ton premium); &#160;

&#8226; Specific battery grade alloys all traded at 1-10% over LME (+2 to +14 cents per lb. or $44&#8211;308 per ton premium); and &#160;

&#8226; Rough lead (unrefined 95% pure) is traded at 5 to 10% below LME (-$.05-0.10 per lb. or $10-20 per ton discount). &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Lead Smelting 

&#160;

Currently, smelters produce virtually all the world&#8217;s mined and recycled lead. Smelting is an inefficient, energy intensive and often highly polluting process. At its core, smelting is a high temperature (in excess of 1700&#176;F) chemical reduction process in which lead compounds are heated and then reacted with reducing agents to remove the oxygen and sulfur, leaving behind lead. The chemical reactions are endothermic, which means that heat must be continually supplied to replace the energy consumed by the reduction processes. In smelting, 5% to 15% of the lead is lost as &#8220;slag&#8221; and the lead produced typically contains 2% or more of impurities. Importantly, smelting is only cost effective at large scale, typically more than 200 metric tons of lead per day.

&#160;

In addition to the high costs and inefficiencies associated with smelting, it generates large volumes of toxic solid, liquid, particulate and gaseous waste. In developed countries, there is both increased environmental regulation and enforcement of such, including monitoring of permissible blood lead levels in employees and local populations. These regulations and the increasing enforcement have made it more expensive to operate smelters. According to a report titled &#8220;Hazardous Trade?&#8221; produced by the Secretariat of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation in 2013, this has led to a decline of lead smelters in the U.S., an expansion of smelting operations in Mexico and a resultant increase in the export of used LABs from the U.S. followed by the re-import of recycled lead. This trade is believed to be largely driven by the lower costs related to the less stringent environmental standards and enforcement in Mexico. For the foregoing reasons, we believe that lead smelting facilities are increasingly located in poorly regulated areas remote from both the source of used LABs and the demand for lead. We believe that the remote location of smelting increases the transport costs to the production of recycled lead.

&#160; 

Lead Acid Batteries 

&#160;

The lead acid battery was invented in 1859 and is the oldest and most popular type of rechargeable battery. LABs have the ability to provide higher surge currents than other rechargeable batteries, making them ideal for use in motor vehicles and other machines to provide the high current required by starter motors. LABs are also used in lithium-ion battery-powered electric vehicles to power most functions (outside of the drive train). The relatively inexpensive cost of manufacturing makes LABs attractive for other uses as well, including storage in backup power supplies in cell phone towers, grid storage applications and high-availability settings like hospitals, and stand-alone power systems.

&#160;

The majority of LAB production, and with it the majority of lead, goes into what are called &#8220;starter, lighting, ignition&#8221; batteries for automotive vehicles. According to CHR Metals, total lead output in 2017 will be 20% higher than it was in 2012. Similarly, articles published in the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal support continued growth in demand for lead for at least the next 20 years as car ownership increases rapidly in developing nations. The battery market for electric e-bikes and scooters in China is one example of a recent and rapidly growing niche application for LABs. This niche has grown from minimal roots in 2005 to accounting for over 15% of LAB production in 2012. There are now over 150 million e-bikes and scooters on the road in China, and nearly all of them are powered by LABs. We believe that grid storage and other energy storage applications linked to renewable energy (solar and wind) will also generate increased demand for LABs, where low cost, safety and reliability will make them attractive options.

&#160;

The increase in LAB manufacturing in general and particularly in China, India and Southeast Asia has increased demand for lead, putting pressure on global recycling networks to meet this demand. At present, we believe that most of the LAB recycling performed outside of the U.S., Canada, the EU, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand is carried out in outdated facilities with poor environmental standards and insufficient enforcement. China, India, Pakistan and South America appear to be moving toward tougher regulation and enforcement. We believe that this will drive a demand in foreign markets for more less polluting LAB recycling processes.

&#160; 

Our Business Model 

&#160;

The market for lead is global in scale but local in nature and execution, with large differences in local regulation, custom and practice. In some regions it is highly regulated, and in others it is not. Consequently, we have developed our business model to commercialize our technology optimally across multiple countries.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In the US and similarly regulated countries, our plan is to build and operate our own LAB recycling facilities. These will be smaller distributed facilities rather than large centralized facilities as are required for smelting. Our plan is to locate our recycling facilities close to regional supplies of used LABs, starting with locations that are furthest from existing LAB smelting facilities. In countries where direct operation is not possible or not optimal due to local laws that restrict or limit foreign ownership of operating businesses or otherwise, we plan to supply our process to approved third party customers on a fee-sharing basis.

&#160;

Lead recycling is subject to a variety of domestic and international regulations related to hazardous materials, emissions, employee safety and other matters. While our operations will be subject to these regulations, we believe that one of our potential advantages will be our ability to conduct lead recycling operations with less regulatory cost and burden than smelting operators. One of our key objectives will be to educate regulators and the public as to the environmental benefits of AquaRefining. We believe we have the potential to develop a business model that offers both strong economics and the opportunity to conduct in a socially responsible manner an important recycling activity that to date has been conducted in an inefficient, energy intensive and often highly polluting manner.

&#160; 

AquaRefining Process 

&#160;

We developed AquaRefining to be a less expensive, cleaner and modular alternative to smelting. Our process has two key elements, both of which are integral to our pending-patent application. The first is our use of a proprietary, non-toxic solvent that dissolves lead compounds. The second is a proprietary electro-chemical process and electrolyzer that converts the dissolved lead compounds into pure, primary grade lead on a fully automated basis.

&#160;

Similar to conventional LAB recycling, our AquaRefining process begins with the crushing of used LABs and the separation of the metallic lead, active material (lead compounds), sulfuric acid and plastic for recycling. The active material is dissolved in our solvent. The primary lead is then stripped from the solvent using our patent pending and fully automated process allowing the solvent to be reused continuously and indefinitely.

&#160;

Our AquaRefining process generates three outputs, namely:

&#160;

&#183; Lead; &#160;

&#183; Cleaned plastic chips, recovered from battery casings, which we intend to sell; and &#160;

&#183; Sulfuric acid, which is recovered as part of our AquaRefining process, which we also intend to sell. &#160;

We expect to derive revenue primarily from the sale of lead, with additional revenue derived from the sale of cleaned plastic chips and sulphuric acid expected to be modest.

&#160;

We plan to sell three types of lead:

&#160;

&#183; Secondary lead &#8211; lead which meets the purity standards for secondary lead traded on the LME &#160;

&#183; Specifically formulated battery grade lead alloys &#8211; which in time, we have a reasonable expectation of selling at LME +10% &#160;

&#183; Primary lead &#8211; which in time, we have a reasonable expectation of selling at LME +15%. &#160;

A significant benefit of our AquaRefining process is that it is capable of producing high purity (primary grade) lead, without the need for the highly energy intensive and wasteful, thermal processing that is required by conventional smelted lead. However, selling primary grade lead through LME requires a formal application, review and testing process, which if successful results in an LME approved brand of primary lead. We expect that this approval process will take at least 12-18 months and there is no guarantee of success. For this reason, we have not included the premiums available through the sale of primary lead in our financial modeling or cash flow planning.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Another significant benefit of our process is that we designed the equipment used in the process to be manufactured on a purpose-built production line, in standard sized modules. This is not possible with the smelting process, as smelters need to be constructed on site. This gives us the ability to provide AquaRefining systems with capacities ranging from four metric tons per day to 400 metric tons per day or more all based on our standard factory produced module.

&#160; 

Equipment Partnering and Marketing 

&#160;

In early 2014, Wirtz Manufacturing Co, Inc. expressed its interest in working with us to build AquaRefining facilities and distributing AquaRefining modules as a replacement for or alternative to smelter based LAB recycling systems.

&#160;

Subsequently, Wirtz participated in both our $6 million convertible note offering and our IPO. We have since procured a majority of the conventional LAB recycling equipment and processes from Wirtz.

&#160;

We believe that in due course, the provision of AquaRefining equipment could become a significant part of our business. Although we do not expect this to become material until after our Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (&#8220;TRIC&#8221;) facility is operational, we have commenced informal joint marketing with Wirtz. In September 2015, Wirtz supported us at the bi-annual Secondary Lead Conference in Bangkok and Wirtz continues to conduct joint marketing our product to Wirtz&#8217; existing customers.

&#160; 

Our First Recycling Facility: McCarran, Nevada 

&#160;

We have commenced the development of our initial LAB recycling facility near Reno, Nevada. On May 29, 2015, we purchased 11.73 acres of undeveloped land for the purchase price of $1,047,503. The property is located in TRIC, a 107,000-acre park located nine miles east of Reno on I-80. TRIC includes a developable 30,000-acre industrial complex, with pre-approved industrial and manufacturing uses and on-site rail service by both the Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe railways and is both the home of the Tesla Gigafactory and a large LAB distribution and collection business, Battery Systems Inc.

&#160;

On August 17, 2015, we commenced construction of a 136,750 square foot LAB recycling facility at our TRIC property and have allocated a total of $29.5 million of working capital towards the development of the facility, including $14 million towards site construction and $14.5 million towards the manufacture and installation of 16 AquaRefining modules, other equipment and fixtures. The TRIC facility will include a fully self-contained battery breaking and pre-treatment facility, which will be supplied, at our cost, by Wirtz Manufacturing Co., Inc. As of the date of this report, we expect to complete construction of the TRIC facility in the second quarter of 2016. We also expect to install our first AquaRefining modules in the second quarter 2016 and to install a total of 16 AquaRefining modules to support an initial lead production capacity of 80 tons per day by the close of the third quarter of 2016. In keeping with our modular approach, we intend to commence commercial LAB recycling operations shortly after the first AquaRefining module is delivered.

&#160;

In connection with the development and operation of our TRIC facility, we will be required to obtain, among other government permits and approvals, a use permit from the State of Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Waste Management and an air quality permit from the State of Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Air Pollution Control. Based on our meetings with officials from each of these agencies and our own permitting study, we do not expect to encounter any material issues or delays in obtaining all required permits and other governmental approvals for the construction and operation of our TRIC facility.

&#160;

We intend to establish additional recycling facilities throughout the US and overseas. However, we have no agreements or plans at this time concerning any recycling facilities other than our proposed TRIC facility.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Supply of Used LABs 

&#160;

We believe there is an ample supply of used LABs in the market today and will be for the foreseeable future. The used LAB market consists primarily of LAB manufacturers, LAB specialists and distributors and LAB recovery consolidators. We have entered into formal discussions with three separate suppliers of used LABs. Each of these suppliers has the ability to supply enough used LABs to operate our TRIC facility at 80 metric tons of produced lead per day and have expressed a desire to do so. Although we have no definitive agreements in place as of the date of this report with any LAB suppliers, based on our understanding of the market for used LABs and our discussions to date with LAB suppliers, we believe that used LABs should be readily available to us from a number of sources at competitive prices.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any commercially viable alternative to smelting for LAB recycling in operation, except for one variation on smelting that uses a thermal lance to provide the heat. This process, known as Isamelt, has some limited advantages over smelting but has not been widely taken up, although it has been in existence for over 20 years. In addition, several years ago, Engitec Technologies S.p.A. developed an electro-refining process as an alternative to smelting for lead ore. The process is known as the Flubor process and uses fluoboric acid as an electrolyte. We believe The Doe Run Company, a US-based operator of lead smelters, evaluated this process for the production of primary lead, however, to our knowledge, the Flubor process has never been used in commercial lead recycling by The Doe Run Company or anyone else.

&#160;

We believe that our primary competition in the production of lead will come from operators of existing smelters and other parties invested in the existing supply chain for smelting, both of which may resist the change presented by AquaRefining. Competition from such incumbents may come in the form of price competition for lead produced, however to the extent we are successful in being a low cost producer of lead, we should be able to compete effectively based on price.

&#160;

Another area where incumbents may seek to compete is in controlling access to used LABs. The market for used LABs is made up of the members of the LAB reverse supply chains, including auto repair shops, auto parts stores and auto dealers, LAB manufacturers who operate their own smelting operations and third parties who engage in the purchase and sale of used LABs. We believe that some LAB manufacturers who maintain their own smelting operations may feel significantly threatened by our AquaRefining process. Such parties may attempt to restrict our access to used LABs; however, we believe these LAB manufacturers only control approximately 50% of the market for used LABs, leaving us with significant access to LABs even if these parties do attempt to interfere. We have assumed at least some level of interference by incumbents and have initiated discussions with potential suppliers of used LABs. On the basis of these discussions, we do not view access to used LABs be a significant risk to our LAB recycling operations.

&#160;

While we assume that smelters will be resistant, at least at first, to AquaRefining, we have received preliminary inquiries from a number of existing operators of lead smelters who are interested in augmenting their existing capacity or replacing it entirely with our AquaRefining modules. However, our business plan is not dependent or even focused on the acceptance of our process by lead smelters. We intend to initially focus on operating our AquaRefining facilities directly.

&#160;

We do not expect to experience significant competition in connection with our sale of lead. We believe that the market for lead is established, fluid and effective; and like the markets for other natural resources, such as oil, gas, gold, silver, etc., we do not expect to encounter any issues, conditions or qualifications for the sale of our lead production at prevailing market prices set by the LME. The vertically integrated LAB manufacturers who conduct smelting operations also are buyers of lead from third parties. While these LAB manufacturers may feel threatened by our AquaRefining process, we believe that they will still purchase lead from us if we are able to offer it at the price we anticipate. Notwithstanding this, we believe that the vertically integrated LAB manufacturers account for only 50% of the demand for lead production, leaving a sizable amount of the lead market in the hands of purchasers who we believe will not be reluctant to purchase lead from us.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Intellectual Property Rights 

&#160;

We regard the protection of our technologies and intellectual property rights as an important element of our business operations and crucial to our success. We rely primarily on a combination of patent laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology. We generally require our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual&#8217;s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except under specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements provide that all of the technology that is conceived by the individual during the course of employment is our exclusive property. The development of our technology and many of our processes are dependent upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key scientific and technical personnel.

&#160;

In November 2013, we filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, a provisional patent covering multiple aspects of our AquaRefining process, including all aspects of our proprietary water-based solvent and our novel electrolyzer. In November 2014, our provisional patent application was converted into a non-provisional patent application which was filed in accordance with the Patent Cooperation Treaty and contained 35 claims. The claims seek patent protection for the entirety of the novel aspects of our process, starting with the dissolution of the lead compounds recovered from a used LAB, the solvents used and the range of chemical compositions under which they are effective. The claims also extend to novel aspects of the electrochemical apparatus and the range of electrochemical parameters, such as electrical current, voltage and solution pH. Finally, the claims seek patent protection for the type and composition of the electrodes used, the form and quality of the lead produced and methods of removing the lead from the electrodes.

&#160;

In May 2015, we filed an additional non-provisional patent application with the USPTO in accordance with Patent Cooperation Treaty which contained 39 claims. These claims seek to provide additional, complementary and alternative aspects of the November 2014 filing.

&#160;

In May 2015, we filed an additional six provisional patent applications with the USPTO containing a total of 54 claims. These provisional filings seek to extend our patent protection in our core process technology and seek patent coverage for areas including ancillary processes, electrolyte and water recovery, the form and uses of the lead produced and applications of our process to materials other than lead.

&#160;

In November of 2015, we filed additional patent applications. These patent filings seek to extend our patent protection in our core process technology and seek patent coverage for additional higher value forms and uses of the lead produced and applications of our process to materials other than lead.

&#160;

We intend to conduct foreign patent filings covering the claims in our provisional and non-provisional patent applications.

&#160;

There can be no assurance that any patents will issue from any of our current or any future applications. Also, any patents that may issue may not survive a legal challenge to their scope, validity or enforceability, or provide significant protection for us. The failure of our patents, or the failure of trade secret laws, to adequately protect our technology, might make it easier for our competitors to copy our AquaRefining process.

&#160;

We have also filed for trademark registration in the US of our corporate name &#8220;Aqua Metals&#8221; and the terms &#8220;AquaRefining,&#8221; &#8220;AquaRefinery&#8221; and &#8220;AquaRefine&#8221; and intend to conduct foreign filings of these marks.

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Our operations in the United States will be subject to the Federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws applicable to the reclamation of LABs. While the lead reclamation process itself is generally not subject to Federal permitting requirements, depending on how any particular operation is structured, our facilities may have to obtain environmental permits or approvals from Federal, state or local regulators to operate, including permits or regulatory approvals related to air emissions, water discharges, waste management, and the storage of LABs on-site should that become necessary. We may face opposition from local residents or public interest groups to the installation and operation of our facilities. Failure to secure (or significant delays in securing) the necessary approvals could prevent us from pursuing some of our planned operations and adversely affect our business, financial results and growth prospects.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to permitting requirements, our operations are subject to environmental health, safety and transportation laws and regulations that govern the management of and exposure to hazardous materials such as the lead and acids involved in LAB reclamation. These include hazard communication and other occupational safety requirements for employees, which may mandate industrial hygiene monitoring of employees for potential exposure to lead. Failure to comply with these requirements could subject our business to significant penalties (civil or criminal) and other sanctions that could adversely affect our business. Changes to these regulatory requirements in the future could also increase our costs, require changes in or cessation of certain activities, and adversely affect the business.

&#160;

The nature of our operations involve risks, including the potential for exposure to hazardous materials such as lead, that could result in personal injury and property damage claims from third parties, including employees and neighbors, which claims could result in significant costs or other environmental liability. Our operations also pose a risk of releases of hazardous substances, such as lead or acids, into the environment, which can result in liabilities for the removal or remediation of such hazardous substances from the properties at which they have been released, liabilities which can be imposed regardless of fault, and our business could be held liable for the entire cost of cleanup even if we were only partially responsible. Like any manufacturer, we are also subject to the possibility that we may receive notices of potential liability in connection with materials that were sent to third-party recycling, treatment, and/or disposal facilities under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), and comparable state statutes, which impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination, and for damages to natural resources. Liability under CERCLA is retroactive, and, under certain circumstances, liability for the entire cost of a cleanup can be imposed on any responsible party.

&#160;

As our business expands outside of the United States, our operations will be subject to the environmental, health and safety laws of the countries where we do business, including permitting and compliance requirements that address the similar risks as do the laws in the United States, as well as international legal requirements such as those applicable to the transportation of hazardous materials. Depending on the country or region, these laws could be as stringent as those in the US, or they could be less stringent or not as strictly enforced. In some countries in which we are interested in expanding our business, such as Mexico and China, the relevant environmental regulatory and enforcement frameworks are in flux and subject to change. Therefore, while compliance with these requirements will cause our business to incur costs, and failure to comply with these requirements could adversely affect our business, it is difficult to evaluate such potential costs or adverse impacts until such time as we decide to initiate operations in particular countries outside the United States.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of the date of this report, we employ 21 people on a full-time basis, including our four executive officers, four administrative staff, 10 technical staff, and three employees to support the production of our AquaRefining modules. In addition, we have seven full time contract people, including five technical and two production contractors. We also expect to hire up to 60 additional employees in 2016 in connection with the operation of our LAB recycling facility near Reno, Nevada.
