Overview 

&#160; 

We are a leading genome editing company dedicated to treating patients with genetically defined diseases by correcting their disease &#8209;causing genes. We believe that we have entered a new era of genomic medicine as the growth of genomic information in recent decades has significantly expanded the understanding of genetically defined diseases. A new technology known as CRISPR (clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR associated protein 9) has the potential to achieve precise, directed changes in DNA. The confluence of these two streams of scientific endeavor, understanding genetic defects and having the tools to be able to address them, creates the opportunity for us to achieve a longstanding goal of medicine: to treat the root causes of diseases at the genetic level. Our mission is to translate the promise of our science into a broad class of transformative genomic medicines to benefit the greatest number of patients. 

&#160; 

We are developing a proprietary genome editing platform based on CRISPR/Cas9 technology. CRISPR/Cas9 uses a protein &#8209;RNA complex composed of the Cas9 enzyme bound to a guide RNA molecule designed to recognize a particular DNA sequence that requires repair. Once there, the complex makes a specific cut in the DNA, ultimately triggering the cell &#8217; s DNA repair machinery to address the genetic defect. Our platform consists of four interrelated components: nuclease engineering, delivery, control and specificity, and directed editing. These components are designed to develop medicines that specifically address a wide variety of genetic targets, reach the site of disease safely and effectively, tightly and specifically control the editing process, and drive the right kind of genetic repair. Our preclinical drug discovery platform uses the flexibility of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to enable rapid reprogramming of the Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complex with the potential to direct it to almost any site in the human genome. Using this platform, we aim to develop and advance a broad range of therapies for genetically defined diseases. 

&#160; 

Our product development strategy is to target genetically defined diseases with an initial focus on debilitating illnesses where there are no approved treatments and where the genetic basis of disease is well understood. We are advancing over a dozen discovery research programs that we have selected based on our assessment of the structure of the genetic mutation and edit required, our ability to deliver the product candidate to the site of disease, the severity of the disease, the ability to identify appropriate patients, and the availability of informative preclinical assays and models and suitable clinical endpoints. Our most advanced research program is designed to address Leber Congenital Amaurosis type 10, or LCA10, a specific genetic form of progressive blindness with no available therapies or potential treatments in clinical trials in either the United States or European Union. The localization of LCA10 disease in the eye allows us to efficiently apply our technology in a context that is confined and relatively uncomplicated compared to many of the systemic illnesses we also anticipate treating over time. We aim to initiate a clinical trial in this program in 2017. We believe achievement of proof &#8209;of &#8209;concept in a disease of the eye has the potential to validate our platform technology, including its potential application to other organs and diseases. Our additional research programs address genetic, infectious, and oncologic diseases of the liver, lung, blood, eye, and muscle. 

&#160; 

We believe our genome editing technologies have the potential to improve the characteristics of cellular therapies, including engineered T cells to treat cancer. To realize this potential, in May 2015, we entered into a collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, a leader in the emerging field of immuno &#8209;oncology. Under the collaboration, we received an upfront payment of $25.0 million and are eligible to receive research support of up to $22.0 million over a five year period across three programs and approximately $700 million in aggregate in potential research, regulatory, and commercial sales milestone payments for each of the first products developed in each of the three research programs. By working with Juno Therapeutics, we hope that together we will be able to discover and develop the next generation of engineered T cell therapies that have the potential to substantially advance the field of cancer immunotherapy. We believe this collaboration exemplifies our strategy of selectively establishing alliances with leaders in their fields to realize the full therapeutic potential of genome editing. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our company was founded by world leaders in genome editing, who are affiliated with institutions that include The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Massachusetts General Hospital. Through their service as consultants and advisors, our founders were instrumental in defining the initial scientific vision for our company. Collectively, our founders have made many fundamental discoveries in the field of genome editing and have enabled the translation of CRISPR from its origins in bacterial systems to its application in mammalian cells. Among our founders, Drs. Feng Zhang, George Church, David Liu, and J. Keith Joung continue to provide important scientific guidance and insights to us through ongoing consulting and advisory arrangements. Their discoveries, along with inventions by scientists at our company, have led to our broad portfolio of intellectual property, including the patent estates licensed from those founders &#8217; institutions. In connection with their consulting and advisory arrangements with us, Drs. Zhang, Church, Liu, and Joung have assignment of inventions obligations to us with respect to the services they perform for us, subject to limitations, including that such assignment obligations do not extend to their work in other fields or to the intellectual property arising from their employment with their respective academic and research institutions. As of February 29, 2016, o ur portfolio include d &#160; 24 issued U.S. and European patents and over 330 pending patent applications. We believe the breadth and depth of our patent estate is a substantial asset and has the potential to provide us with a durable competitive position in the marketplace. 

&#160; 

We believe that our team and our culture are critical to our success. The lifeblood of our company is exceptional scientists and company &#8209;builders with experience across leading biopharmaceutical companies and academic research laboratories. Our company is distinguished by our leaders &#8217; substantial experience in translating groundbreaking scientific platforms into therapeutic products and product candidates at Adnexus Therapeutics, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Avila Therapeutics, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, and Novartis Pharmaceuticals. In addition, our board of directors has deep experience in guiding biotechnology companies through rapid growth and the development of complex, breakthrough science. 

&#160; 

Every decade over the past 40 years, an important class of medicines has emerged, such as recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and RNA &#8209;based drugs. These new categories of medicines have brought forth important therapies for previously untreated diseases. In our view, genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 has the potential to be one of the next major new categories. At Editas Medicine, we believe we can make that potential a reality.

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

We aim to transform the treatment of a broad range of genetically defined diseases by building an integrated genomic medicine company focused on creating a novel class of therapeutics to meet patients &#8217; needs. Key elements of our strategy are to: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Build the preeminent genomic medicine company . Developing a major new technology like CRISPR/Cas9 requires an exceptional organization. We have assembled a group of world leaders in the fields of genome editing, gene therapy, nucleic acid pharmaceuticals, and orphan diseases. We will continue to build and expand our team to encompass all the capabilities needed to develop and commercialize medicines and to run an outstanding company. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Advance therapeutic programs rapidly and rigorously to address patients&#8217; needs . Our strategy centers around developing medicines where the genetic basis of disease is well understood and where we believe our approach can provide unique benefits by addressing the root cause of the disease. For example, we chose LCA10 as our first program due to the absence of therapeutic options and the amenability of the underlying mutation to genome editing. We believe our product development strategy will initially result in therapies for rare and orphan diseases that have the potential to advance rapidly and deliver substantial benefits for patients, and we aim to identify and advance product candidates into clinical trials on a consistent basis. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Perfect the tools to repair any broken gene . Our genome editing platform is composed of a broad set of tools that we use to design and optimize product candidates for many different genetically defined diseases. We plan to continue to invest resources as we further expand the four interrelated components of our platform: nuclease engineering, delivery, control and specificity, and directed editing. We are developing new capabilities in each of these components so that we can fully realize the therapeutic potential of genome editing. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Accelerate the science of genome editing . Our founders and scientists are leaders in the extremely fast &#8209;moving field of genome editing. We are committed to maintaining and extending our leadership in this field while empowering the broader scientific field through continued internal and external investment in basic science and translational research in genome editing. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Collaborate to realize the full potential of genome editing to create medicines . Because of the broad potential for our technology, we have and will continue to seek collaborations with pioneering companies, such as Juno Therapeutics, and with leading academic and research institutions to expand and improve the range of product candidates we discover and develop. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Commercialize products to bring new medicines to patients . We believe that therapies for genetically defined diseases can often be brought to patients through a small, targeted commercial organization without the need for a commercial partner. In these cases, we intend to commercialize our own products to retain the greatest value for shareholders. For any other products, we intend to maximize the commercial opportunity through selective partnering. 

&#160; 

Our Focus &#8212; Genome Editing 

&#160; 

Humans possess a genome sequence of roughly three billion base pairs of nucleotides, the building blocks of the DNA double helix. DNA serves as the road map for cellular function. Small changes, or mutations, routinely occur in the base pairs of our DNA. At the molecular level, these mutations can be categorized as single base pair changes, small insertions or deletions, large deletions, duplications, or repetitive sequence expansions. A mutation could occur on one or both alleles, or copies, of a gene in a cell. In some cases, these mutations can lead to a failure to produce proteins that are necessary for normal function or the production of abnormal proteins, either of which can cause disease. Genetically defined diseases vary dramatically in their pathologies, their sites of manifestation, and the specific natures of their root causes. Currently, there are approximately 6,000 diseases that are known to be caused by genetic mutations. Familiar examples of genetically defined diseases include cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Huntington &#8217; s disease, retinitis pigmentosa, and sickle cell anemia. 

&#160; 

Major investments in the human genome project, clinical sample collection and characterization, and the subsequent development of low cost and rapid DNA sequencing and informatics tools have revolutionized the understanding of genetically defined diseases and paved the way for advancing the field of genomic medicine. For example, many diseases previously thought to be genetically complex in nature have now been re &#8209;categorized as several distinct diseases that present with similar clinical dispositions, but are caused by different single &#8209;gene defects. Diseases caused by single &#8209;gene defects are known as monogenic disorders. The identification of monogenic disorders has resulted in a shift towards therapeutic approaches targeted at specific mutations, as opposed to the symptom &#8209;specific or pathology &#8209;specific approaches of the past. We believe monogenic disorders are particularly suitable for treatment by genome editing because a single edit has the potential to correct the disease. 

&#160; 

&#160;

While genetic defects are now recognized as the causes of many diseases, the vast majority of these diseases lack effective treatments. Of the estimated 6,000 diseases that are known to be caused by genetic mutations, we believe fewer than 5% are served by approved therapies. In some cases, these existing therapies only treat the symptoms of the disease. In other cases, existing therapies modify the course of disease, but do not address the underlying genetic defect. 

&#160; 

The Field of Genomic Medicine 

&#160; 

Genomic medicine harnesses the knowledge of genetics to guide the care of patients and create new therapies. There are several technologies that have the potential to create medicines in this field. These technologies can be grouped into two broad categories: gene augmentation and genome editing. Each approach seeks to address genetically defined diseases at the level of DNA. However, gene augmentation, which is commonly called gene therapy, and genome editing differ fundamentally with regard to the kind of genomic change they seek to accomplish. 

&#160; 

Gene therapy is an approach whereby a new gene is transferred into cells to augment a defective gene. This can either be through insertion of the new gene directly into a patient &#8217; s DNA without specific regard to the site of insertion or delivering a piece of DNA to exist alongside the patient &#8217; s genome without being integrated into it. Gene therapy transfers new DNA into cells, however it does not remove or modify the defective DNA and it generally introduces the new genetic material in a location where it is not subject to the cell &#8217; s normal control and feedback mechanisms. This approach is suited for a finite set of genetically defined diseases. 

&#160; 

Genome editing is the process of revising, removing, or repairing defective DNA in situ . Genome editing corrects the defective DNA in its native location, and consequently the repaired genetic region retains the cell &#8217; s normal control and feedback mechanisms. The diversity of genetic drivers of disease demands a variety of solutions. Genome editing has the potential to deliver a variety of types of genome modification to address a broad range of genetically defined diseases. 

&#160; 

At its core, genome editing is a two &#8209;step process. In the first step, an enzyme is brought to the desired site and makes a specific cut. This enzyme, which is called a DNA endonuclease, is capable of cutting one or both strands in the double &#8209;stranded DNA. After the desired cut or cuts are made, the cell &#8217; s DNA repair machinery responds to complete the edit through one of two possible mechanisms &#8212; non &#8209;homologous end joining or homology directed repair &#8212; that can be harnessed for therapeutic effect in a range of ways. These types of edits could be applied to one or both alleles of the gene in the cell depending on the nature of the mutation. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The first mechanism, non &#8209;homologous end joining, or NHEJ, occurs in the absence of a DNA template for the cell to copy as it repairs a DNA cut. The NHEJ response tends to leave small insertions and deletions at the cut site, collectively referred to as indels. The NHEJ mechanism can be used to either cut and revise the targeted gene or to cut and remove a segment of DNA, depending on how many cuts are made. In the &#8220; cut and revise &#8221; process, depicted on the left below, a single cut is made, which can result in the creation of an indel during the repair process. In the &#8220; cut and remove &#8221; process, depicted on the right below, two cuts are made, which results in the removal of the intervening segment and the joining of the two ends of DNA. This approach could be used to delete either a small or a large segment of DNA depending on the type of repair desired. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The second mechanism, homology directed repair, or HDR, occurs in the presence of a DNA template that is similar to the DNA that has been cut. The cell can use the template to construct reparative DNA, resulting in the replacement of defective genetic sequences with correct ones. This can be thought of as a &#8220; cut and replace &#8221; process. As shown in the example below, HDR is used to replace a defective sequence of GCACCTGAATG with the correct sequence of AGTCGCATCCC. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Whether NHEJ or HDR is likely to be more therapeutically effective depends on the nature of the targeted genetic defect. The ability of genome editing approaches to utilize both mechanisms provides the opportunity to develop therapies for larger patient populations and a broader range of indications than either of the individual mechanisms alone. Although many of our initial programs utilize the NHEJ mechanism, we believe that the combination of our investment in the science of HDR and the work we and others are doing to modulate how cells use different repair pathways has the potential to result in medicines that take advantage of either mechanism to arrive at the desired genomic correction. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Advantages of CRISPR/Cas9 for Genome Editing 

&#160; 

CRISPR/Cas9 technology uses a protein &#8209;RNA complex composed of an enzyme known as Cas9 bound to a guide RNA molecule that has been designed to recognize a particular DNA sequence. This recognition occurs when the appropriate portion of the guide RNA matches a DNA sequence, and when that DNA sequence is next to a short DNA sequence called the protospacer adjacent motif, or PAM. A PAM is part of the overall DNA pattern sought by the Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complex to recognize a location in the genome. We believe that CRISPR/Cas9 technology has three principal advantages for genome editing: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Rapid, comprehensive, and systematic identification of product candidates. The key targeting mechanism for the Cas9 nuclease is an engineered guide RNA, which can be rapidly replaced with a different guide RNA or optimized by changes as small as a single nucleotide. This allows for the flexible design, synthesis, and testing of hundreds of guide RNA/Cas9 combinations for each genetic target in order to find those that cut the DNA target with the optimal efficiency and specificity. In contrast, other commonly used DNA nucleases for genome editing have inherently limited flexibility. For example, zinc finger nucleases, engineered meganucleases, and transcription activator &#8209;like effector nucleases, or TALENs, use proteins for DNA sequence recognition to bring the endonuclease to the site of the genome where cleavage is desired, requiring the creation of an entirely new protein for each target site. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Simultaneous and efficient targeting of multiple sites. In CRISPR/Cas9 technology, multiple guide RNAs can be provided, enabling the simultaneous and efficient targeting of multiple sites. This ability to target multiple DNA sequences expands the applicability of CRISPR/Cas9 technology and also creates the potential for self &#8209;regulating systems that improve on the specificity of genome editing. To address more than one target, other genome editing technologies require the engineering, characterization, manufacture, and delivery of distinct nuclease proteins for each target. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Availability of different types of edits. The availability of the different engineered variants of Cas9 allows for different types of cuts for genome editing, including cuts of both strands of the DNA or either the top or the bottom strand only. In the most broadly exploited genome editing CRISPR systems, the protein endonuclease is a single protein, Cas9, which contains two independent endonuclease sites each responsible for cutting one of the two DNA strands. Importantly, either or both of these sites can be rendered inactive by making specific changes to the Cas9 protein. When one site is rendered inactive, the resulting protein makes either one cut on the top or bottom strand, which is referred to as a nick. This may be a critical component of improved HDR &#8209;driven approaches because the type of DNA cut can influence the type of repair mechanism used by a cell in response to that cut. We believe the ability to modify CRISPR/Cas9 technology to allow for different types of cuts will expand the potential of our genome editing platform. 

&#160; 

Advantages of Our Genome Editing Platform 

&#160; 

In order to fully realize the broad potential of CRISPR/Cas9 technology in developing genome editing medicines, we believe we must achieve each of the following four goals: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

specifically edit a wide range of mutations at different genomic locations, 

&#160; 

&#183; 

reach the site of disease, 

&#160; 

&#183; 

tightly control the cutting, and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

achieve the right repair. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We are developing a proprietary genome editing platform consisting of four interrelated components that are designed to meet these goals. Each component is underpinned by several specific technologies and capabilities. With our platform we are able to design and optimize each element of the product configuration necessary to achieve the desired edit, including the Cas9 variant, the sequence and structure of the guide RNA(s), the delivery vector, and elements to control expression in cells or to drive the desired repair mechanism. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Nuclease Engineering : We use our genome editing platform to identify and optimize both Cas9 enzymes and guide RNA molecules to create what we believe will be the optimal Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complex for a given disease target. We have made substantial advances in the characterization and modification of different natural and engineered variants of Cas9 enzymes and in the design, synthesis, modification, analysis, and characterization of guide RNAs. We believe the diversity of the Cas9 enzymes that we are currently employing and those that we are continuing to further develop have the potential to provide us with a competitive advantage as we develop a range of products with different technical needs. We believe our systematic approach to measurement of both the efficiency and specificity of multiple possible Cas9 enzyme and guide RNA combinations enables us to optimize the identification of lead molecules to progress into more advanced testing. Our aim is to continue to develop new engineered Cas9 enzymes with altered specificities, different DNA cutting capabilities, and additional advanced properties. We believe that further developing our nuclease engineering capabilities will allow us to further broaden the range of diseases we can treat while at the same time ensuring that our products have the best possible safety profiles. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Delivery : An appropriate product configuration must be designed and optimized to provide efficient and tightly controlled delivery to the desired tissue or cell type. Our strategy is to leverage existing delivery technologies to target cell types of interest while developing next generation capabilities as warranted. We are currently exploring, and will continue to explore, a variety of delivery approaches, including adeno &#8209;associated virus, or AAV, and lipid nanoparticles. In addition, there are three types of molecules that we can deliver to a cell to effect genome editing: DN A, RNA, or a ribonucleoprotein, or RNP . Our genome editing platform includes multiple, modular delivery modes that can be efficiently adapted to deliver different CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing components to address the specific needs of each disease targeted. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Control and Specificity : Control of cellular exposure to the Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complex and specificity of the DNA cut are important to optimizing the location and duration of editing activity. We believe these features are critical to designing medicines that are both safe and effective, and we are developing and applying technologies in both areas. We have implemented multiple, discrete analytical methods that provide comprehensive and unbiased assessments of specificity to minimize off &#8209;target effects. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Directed Editing : There are different mechanisms that a cell can use to repair cuts in DNA. Each mechanism results in different kinds of genetic changes. We are developing approaches to selectively harness specific DNA repair mechanisms to be able to drive the appropriate type of repair for a given disease. The ability to direct the DNA repair mechanism is critical to achieving the broadest potential for our platform. We believe that our ability to understand and direct the repair mechanisms used by cells creates opportunities to improve our existing programs and opens up new opportunities to develop medicines. 

&#160; 

All of our research programs have emerged from our proprietary genome editing platform. 

&#160; 

Our Product Development Criteria 

&#160; 

We are targeting genetically defined diseases with a focus on debilitating illnesses where there are no approved treatments and where the genetic basis of the disease is well understood. Our comprehensive project evaluation and selection process takes into consideration the following criteria: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Medical need &#8212; lack of approved therapies and disease severity; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Opportunity for genome editing &#8212; other therapeutic approaches unlikely to be helpful; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Nature of genetic mutation&#8212; whether the mutation is accessible and can be feasibly corrected; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Delivery modality&#8212; whether the delivery modality has been shown to be safe in patients; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Pathophysiology of the disease and treatment window &#8212; presence of viable cells that can be edited as the disease progresses and potential for treatment through genome editing; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Safety and therapeutic index&#8212; ability to assess, monitor, and/or minimize safety risks given the biology of the disease and the anticipated delivery system; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Clinical development path &#8212; consideration of factors such as availability of patients, speed of disease progression, and robust and measurable clinical endpoints; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Regulatory path &#8212; existence of safety and tolerability models as well as suitable clinical endpoints; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Commercial opportunity&#8212; assessment of potential market, including patient population, competitive landscape, and reimbursement. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We believe our systematic approach to developing medicines based on CRISPR/Cas9 technology provides opportunities across a range of different genetically defined diseases. We aim to develop and commercialize biologic medicines for patients with these types of diseases. Where appropriate or necessary, we may do so in collaboration with strategic partners. If successful, we believe our research programs have the potential to yield therapies comprising a combination of elements that may include protein, DNA, and RNA components, which are collectively often referred to as biologics, and which differ from traditional small molecule pharmaceuticals in their greater complexity of manufacturing and delivery. As shown below, as we expand the technical capabilities of our platform, the number of potential patients and range of diseases that can potentially be addressed will grow. Our first programs to develop genome editing medicines take advantage of the efficiency of making either NHEJ &#8209;mediated indels or NHEJ &#8209;mediated deletions of small segments between two cuts. Over time, we expect to expand the repertoire of clinically feasible edits, including increasing larger NHEJ &#8209;mediated deletions and more complex, HDR &#8209;mediated edits. We also intend to develop the ability to achieve HDR &#8209;mediated replacement of entire DNA segments, which we believe will enable substantial expansion of the number of patients we can treat. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In this chart, each figure is intended to represent approximately 5,000 potential patients. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Genomic Medicine Programs 

&#160; 

We have initiated a diversified range of research programs across multiple therapeutic areas. Since our scientific strategy is to optimize our genome editing platform in the context of specific product development efforts, we selected early programs requiring several different types of genome editing and DNA repair &#8212; both NHEJ and HDR. Furthermore, our initial programs use, and will allow us to further optimize, a range of delivery modalities such as local injection, including using an AAV vector, or ex vivo genome modification, where cells are removed from the body, edited, and given back to the patient. We believe the therapeutic programs and delivery technologies we have chosen to date will demonstrate the depth and breadth of our ability to deploy our genome editing platform to treat patients in need. The current status of our programs is summarized in the table below: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Eye Diseases 

&#160; 

Leber Congenital Amaurosis 10 

&#160; 

Leber Congenital Amaurosis, or LCA, is a heterogeneous group of inherited retinal dystrophies caused by mutations in at least 18 different genes and is the most common cause of inherited childhood blindness, with an incidence of two to three per 100,000 live births worldwide. Symptoms of LCA appear within the first year of life with significant vision loss, rapid involuntary movements of the eyes, and absence of measurable electroretinogram recordings due to progressive loss of photoreceptor cells. Imaging studies of LCA patients have shown that the intracranial visual pathways remain intact into early adulthood even though photoreceptor cells have already experienced damage. As a result, we believe that therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring function of the remaining photoreceptor cells could arrest the further loss of vision in LCA patients, provided that treatment can be initiated prior to complete vision loss. 

&#160; 

The most common form of the disease, referred to as LCA10, is a monogenic disorder and represents approximately 20 &#8209;30% of all LCA subtypes. LCA10 is caused by an autosomal recessive mutation in the gene CEP290, which encodes a protein required for the survival and proper function of photoreceptor cells. The most frequently found mutation within the CEP290 gene is an A to G nucleotide change that disrupts normal splicing, or processing, of the 

&#160;

gene, ultimately resulting in the generation of a smaller and nonfunctional protein. Decreased CEP290 function leads to loss of photoreceptor cells over time which leads to blindness. 

&#160; 

We assessed LCA10 comprehensively and found that it fits well with our genome editing approach and criteria to product development. These criteria include: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Medical need: Currently, there is no approved treatment or potential therapy in clinical trials in either the United States or European Union for LCA10, and complete vision loss is the inevitable outcome; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Opportunity for genome editing: Gene therapy is not currently a viable approach to treating LCA10 because it requires delivery of the entire DNA coding sequence for CEP290, which is too large to fit into the best &#8209;characterized ocular gene therapy vector, AAV. In contrast, genome editing only requires delivery of the DNA coding sequence for the relevant Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complex, which can fit into AAV; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Nature of genetic mutation : The A to G nucleotide change in the CEP290 gene is located in an intron, which is a portion of DNA that does not code for a protein. This allows genome editing via NHEJ with reduced risk of altering a protein coding sequence; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Delivery modality: Sub &#8209;retinal AAV injection is the delivery mode for current gene augmentation therapy trials for related ophthalmic diseases and can be used for this program; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Pathophysiology of the disease and treatment window: The photoreceptors of LCA10 patients die over a period of time, and loss of vision corresponds with loss of photoreceptors. By treating patients who retain some vision, there is a window to repair the CEP290 gene in remaining photoreceptor cells; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Safety and therapeutic index: Because the eye is an immune &#8209;privileged location, injection directly into the eye minimizes risk of a systemic toxic response by the immune system. In addition, because the product candidate will be delivered directly to the eye, there is likely to be minimal overall systemic exposure; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Clinical development path: There are readily measurable endpoints such as visual acuity measures, electroretinography and optical coherence tomography that allow minimally invasive assessment of disease progression; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Regulatory path: There are no approved therapies for LCA10. We believe that the combination of clinically meaningful and readily measurable endpoints for diseases of vision, coupled with the unmet need in this orphan patient population, has the potential to enable an accelerated regulatory process; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Commercial opportunity: LCA10 represents a focused market with a defined number of specialized centers treating the affected patients. We believe we can develop an effective small, targeted commercial infrastructure without the need for a commercial partner. 

&#160; 

We are developing a genome editing therapeutic for LCA10 that uses an AAV vector to deliver the DNA encoding Cas9 and two guide RNAs to photoreceptor cells in the eye. In order to deliver this therapy directly and specifically to the site of disease, we are assessing the most well &#8209;established and relevant variants of AAV for retinal delivery. These variants have been shown by others to be effective delivery modalities in clinical trials for various other diseases, including retinal diseases. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our approach is designed to eliminate the A to G nucleotide change in the CEP290 gene described above by cutting out that nucleotide and surrounding DNA, thus restoring normal protein expression and function of the remaining photoreceptor cells, which could arrest the further loss of vision in LCA patients. The diagrams below illustrate the impaired protein expression that results from the LCA10 mutation and how we believe our approach can restore normal protein expression. As shown below, the LCA10 mutation consists of an A to G nucleotide change in the CEP290 gene that occurs in an intron located between exons 26 and 27 of the gene. Exons are regions of DNA that encode for proteins. This mutation results in incorrect processing signals in the messenger RNA, or mRNA, that is transcribed from the gene &#8217; s DNA. This mRNA is then spliced, or processed, incorrectly, and this in turn leads to the inclusion of a premature stop signal, or codon, and the creation of a truncated and nonfunctional protein. 

&#160; 

Segment of CEP290 Gene with Mutation that Causes LCA10 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

As shown below, our approach uses an AAV delivery vehicle containing a Cas9 nuclease and two guide RNA molecules designed to eliminate the mutation by cutting and removing it from the patient &#8217; s genome. As a result, transcription of the edited DNA produces mRNA that no longer contains the premature stop codon, allowing for the production of functional protein. 

&#160; 

Approach to Correcting the CEP290 Gene 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We have tested combinations of Cas9 and guide RNA pairs in cells that were taken from patients with the CEP290 mutation to determine whether they could successfully edit the mutation and lead to correctly spliced mRNA and correctly produced CEP290 protein. We isolated and analyzed DNA from these edited cells and observed removal of the mutation &#8209;containing region in the DNA. Furthermore, as shown in the figure below, these studies also demonstrated that the edit restored significant levels of normal mRNA and lowered the levels of mutant mRNA, as compared to control. This restoration of normal, or wild type, mRNA expression suggests that we successfully corrected the LCA10 gene defect in these cells. 

&#160; 

Expression of Corrected CEP290 mRNA 

&#160; 

&#160; 

These results for guide pair 1 and guide pair 2 were statistically significant, with a p &#8209;value of less than 0.0001. P &#8209;value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of study results. A p &#8209;value of 0.05 or less represents statistical significance, meaning that there is a 1 &#8209;in &#8209;20 or less statistical probability that the observed results occurred by chance. 

&#160; 

&#160;

In these studies we also observed two &#8209;fold and greater increases in full &#8209;length CEP290 protein expression compared to a control. We believe this demonstrates that successful editing of the genetic defect that causes LCA10 also leads to increased expression of the normal CEP290 protein. It is our view that increased expression of normal CEP290 protein could arrest the further loss of vision in LCA10 patients. 

&#160; 

Full &#8209;Length CEP290 Protein Expression 

&#160; 

&#160; 

To characterize editing specificity, we are applying a combination of methods to treated patient cells to quantify the frequency of modification at the targeted DNA location and to assess the potential for edits at off &#8209;target locations. We believe our detailed characterization of editing specificity in vitro will allow us to select guide RNA/Cas9 combinations with the highest likelihood of providing clinical benefit in patients. 

&#160; 

We are evaluating the efficacy of CEP290 editing in human photoreceptors. In these studies, stem cells derived from individuals with a normal LCA10 gene that are differentiated into photoreceptor cells and retina cells removed from human donors will be , in each case, treated with AAV vectors expressing each of the candidate guide RNA pairs together with Cas9. We plan to conduct analyses of editing efficiency and specificity to identify candidate guide RNA/Cas9 complexes for further studies. We believe these studies will give us an initial indication of the therapeutic potential of these product candidates. We aim to initiate IND enabling studies in our LCA10 research program in 2016 and a first clinical trial in 2017. 

&#160; 

Other Eye Diseases 

&#160; 

We also intend to pursue the development of therapies for eye diseases other than LCA10, including Usher Syndrome 2A, or USH2A, and Herpes Simplex Virus 1, or HSV &#8209;1, infections. We believe that our experience with the LCA10 program will support the development of therapies for these other eye diseases. For example, the successful construction, packaging, and testing of the components of the AAV vector we are pursuing for LCA10 will continue to inform our approach to treating USH2A. 

&#160; 

Usher Syndrome 2a 

&#160; 

USH2A gene mutations are the most common cause of Usher syndrome, a form of retinitis pigmentosa. The U.S. population prevalence of Usher syndrome is estimated to be one in 6,000 individuals, and USH2A gene mutations account for an estimated 25 &#8209;30% of all cases of Usher syndrome. Loss of the usherin protein encoded by the USH2A gene leads to a degeneration of the retina and progressive vision loss. More than 200 mutations have been identified for this gene. Our initial goal in this research program is to address mutations within exon 13, which is the location of the highest percentage of USH2A gene mutations. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Herpes Simplex Virus 1 

&#160; 

Herpes Simplex Virus 1, or HSV &#8209;1, causes lifelong infections and mainly causes ocular and oral disease. Infected individuals develop persistent latent infections, mainly in the nerves in the affected part of the body. During latency, the HSV &#8209;1 DNA does not integrate into the infected individual &#8217; s genome but it remains within the individual &#8217; s cells as independent viral genomic material. The latent HSV &#8209;1 virus can then be reactivated by illness, emotional or physical stress, and other conditions. Ocular infection with HSV &#8209;1 is a major health problem, especially in developed countries. It is the most common infectious cause of blindness in the United States with over 35,000 new cases each year. Existing therapies have not been shown to be beneficial in preventing initial HSV &#8209;1 infection or recurrences. As a result, there is a need for an effective therapy that prevents or reduces reactivation of latent HSV &#8209;1. We plan to deliver the CRISPR/Cas9 molecular machinery to the eye and specifically cleave and inactivate latent HSV &#8209;1 DNA with the goal of eliminating or reducing reactivation. 

&#160; 

Engineered T Cell Therapies for Immuno &#8209;Oncology 

&#160; 

Engineered T cells have shown encouraging early clinical activity against multiple cancers, and there is significant interest in the medical community in expanding the application of this technology across a broader range of cancers and patients. Recent data suggest that improving T cell persistence, or the duration these cells are active in the body, positively correlates with anti &#8209;tumor activity. We believe that our genome editing technology has the potential to improve T cell persistence and confer other advantageous properties on engineered T cells, such as overcoming signals in the tumor microenvironment that reduce T cell activity. If we are successful, genome &#8209;edited engineered T cells have the potential to significantly expand the types of cancers treatable by chimeric antigen receptor/T cell receptor, or CAR/TCR, engineered T cells and to improve the outcomes of these therapies. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Through our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, a leader in the emerging field of immuno &#8209;oncology, we plan to direct our genome editing technology towards multiple targets in order to improve the efficacy and safety of CAR/TCR engineered T cells against a range of tumor types. We are currently optimizing genome editing components and delivery methods compatible with engineered T cell manufacturing methods developed by Juno Therapeutics. In an in vitro study under this collaboration, Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complexes directed against two different T cell target genes were delivered into human T cells obtained from three separate donors. At different time points, the extent of genome editing and the percentage of viable cells were measured. We assessed editing by measuring protein expression on the cells &#8217; surfaces following treatment with our Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complexes. We observed high levels of editing, achieving approximately 90% for target A and 50% for target B, across samples from the three donors on day four, as shown in the figure below. 

&#160; 

Editing of T Cell Target Genes in Human T Cells 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

In addition, we observed on average approximately 75% cell viability four days following delivery, as shown in the figure below. We believe this is a sufficiently favorable result to support further advancement of this program. 

&#160; 

Cell Viability of Human T Cells Following 

Delivery of Cas9 &#8209;Guide RNA Complexes 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We and Juno Therapeutics have selected a number of targets for editing using both NHEJ &#8209; and HDR &#8209;based approaches to evaluate the effects on safety and efficacy of CAR/TCR engineered T cells, both ex vivo and in vivo . These studies are designed to facilitate the selection of therapeutic programs to be pursued under our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics. 

&#160; 

Additional Research Programs 

&#160; 

Non &#8209;malignant Hematologic Diseases 

&#160; 

We intend to develop approaches for genome editing in hematopoietic stem cells to support the advancement of other programs to treat non &#8209;malignant hematological diseases. We are investigating the correction of the human beta globin, or HBB, gene in order to treat genetic disorders such as beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease. In an ex vivo study, Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complexes directed against the HBB gene were delivered into hematopoietic stem cells obtained from three separate donors and evaluated against untreated control cells to assess editing activity as well as effects on the cells &#8217; viability, proliferation, and ability to differentiate into different types of blood cells. As shown in the figure below, we observed approximately 55 &#8209;60% editing of the HBB gene in cells treated with Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complexes as compared to no editing observed in the control cells. We observed no substantial differences between the treated cells and the untreated control cells in their viability, proliferation, or ability to differentiate into different types of blood cells. 

&#160; 

&#160;

In addition, we are actively assessing other opportunities to develop medicines for diseases where we believe gene editing of hematopoietic stem cells is likely to produce a therapeutic effect. 

&#160; 

ex vivo Editing of Hemoglobin Beta Gene 

in Human Stem Cells 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We believe advances developed through our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, including our efforts to optimize genome editing components and delivery methods compatible with engineered T cells, may support our current and future non &#8209;malignant hematologic disease programs. 

&#160; 

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 

&#160; 

Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, is a genetic disorder primarily affecting boys and is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy that presents in early childhood and rapidly results in loss of ambulation and respiratory muscle function. Additionally, DMD often causes cardiomyopathy in adolescence. Death occurs typically in early adulthood. The incidence of DMD is approximately one in every 3,500 male births with a prevalence of approximately 15,000 cases in the United States. There are no approved disease &#8209;modifying therapies for the disease. The current standard of care consists of palliative measures such as glucocorticoids and physical therapy as well as braces, wheelchairs, spinal surgeries for scoliosis, and mechanical ventilation. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes dystrophin, a structural protein that is important for normal muscle health. Loss of dystrophin function leads to muscle degeneration. We believe that restoring dystrophin activity before the onset of severe loss of muscle function could significantly and favorably alter disease progression. 

&#160; 

The dystrophin gene is one of the largest in the human genome spanning 2.2 million base pairs. Pathogenic mutations can occur throughout the gene. Many disease &#8209;causing mutations in the dystrophin gene consist of deletions that lead to non &#8209;functional protein. Interestingly, large deletions in the middle of the dystrophin protein have been identified that cause only mild to moderate disease. For example, deletions of selected exons have been shown to cause the much less severe Becker muscular dystrophy. Our genome editing approach is to introduce targeted deletions of mutation &#8209;containing segments of the gene in order to create smaller, yet functional versions of the dystrophin gene. Based on the known spectrum of DMD &#8209;causing mutations, an NHEJ &#8209;mediated small deletion of exon 51 would be expected to address approximately 13% of patients whereas an NHEJ &#8209;mediated large deletion encompassing exons 45 through 55 would expand coverage to up to 60% of patients. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Cystic Fibrosis 

&#160; 

Cystic fibrosis, or CF, is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disease in the Caucasian population. The overall birth prevalence of CF in the United States is approximately one in 3,700. While several organs are affected, the morbidity and mortality is primarily caused by the severity of lung disease. The gene that causes CF encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR, which helps maintain the water balance within the lung. Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to an imbalance of ion and water movement, leading to accumulation of mucus, chronic bacterial infection and inflammation of the airway epithelium. Our genome editing approach is premised on deleting, through NHEJ, a very rare mutation within the CFTR gene. We then intend to leverage that learning to embark on a more technologically challenging approach of correcting, through HDR, the r F508 mutation, which affects approximately 70% of all CF patients. Correcting the CF mutations in lung epithelial cells will require efficient editing of these cells and development of advanced pulmonary delivery modalities. We plan to establish multiple collaborations with academics, foundations, and other companies developing novel lung delivery approaches to achieve these goals. 

&#160; 

Alpha &#8209;1 Antitrypsin Deficiency 

&#160; 

Alpha &#8209;1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disease that causes defective production of the Alpha &#8209;1 Antitrypsin, or A1AT protein, leading to lung and liver disease. A1AT is one of the primary proteins made in the liver and protects the lungs from pro &#8209;inflammatory enzymes. This disease affects about one in 1,500 to 3,500 individuals with European ancestry. Mutations in A1AT lead to accumulation of A1AT aggregates and result in liver and lung disease. The current standards of care are weekly intravenous infusions of functional A1AT protein obtained from human donor plasma, and lung or liver transplant for severe cases. Our genome editing approach starts with deleting, through NHEJ, the gene in the liver to prevent liver disease, followed by gene correction in the liver to address both liver and lung disease. 

&#160; 

Our Genome Editing Platform in Detail 

&#160; 

We are developing a proprietary genome editing platform consisting of four interrelated components that are designed to address four key goals of genome editing: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

create a comprehensive toolbox for robust and selective genome engineering; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

provide efficient and targeted delivery to any tissue or cell; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

effect spatial and temporal control of gene editing and specificity; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

orchestrate the cellular response to ensure accurate and precise genome editing. 

&#160; 

We believe that the developments we have made in our genome editing platform position us to be able to identify and develop innovative genome editing therapies targeting a wide variety of genetically defined diseases. All of our programs to develop medicines leverage aspects of this platform while also providing insights that help improve our ongoing and future drug development capabilities. We believe our genome editing platform forms the basis for our ongoing leadership in the field and differentiates us from other companies working in genome editing. 

&#160; 

Nuclease Engineering 

&#160; 

We use our genome editing platform to identify and optimize both Cas9 enzymes and guide RNA molecules to create what we believe will be the optimal Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complex for a given disease target. We have made substantial advances in the characterization and modification of different natural and engineered variants of Cas9 enzymes and in the design, synthesis, modification, analysis, and characterization of guide RNAs. We believe the diversity of the Cas9 enzymes that we are currently employing and those that we are continuing to further develop has the potential to provide us with a competitive advantage as we develop a range of products with different technical needs. We believe our systematic approach to measurement of both the efficiency and specificity of multiple possible Cas9 enzyme and guide RNA combinations enables us to optimize the identification of lead molecules to progress into more advanced testing. Our aim is to continue to develop new engineered Cas9 enzymes with altered specificities, 

&#160;

different DNA cutting capabilities, and additional advanced properties. For example, we are using directed evolution, a form of guided protein engineering, to develop Cas9 enzymes that recognize different PAMs in order to target additional locations in the genome. We are also developing Cas9 enzymes that can cut DNA in an allele &#8209;specific manner. We believe that further developing our nuclease engineering capabilities will allow us to further broaden the range of diseases we can treat while at the same time ensuring that our products have the best possible safety profiles. 

&#160; 

We have characterized different Cas9 enzymes for several reasons. Firstly, a smaller enzyme will have advantages for delivering the endonuclease using a viral vector due to the inherent size limitations of most such delivery systems. For example, the Cas9 enzyme from Staphylococcus aureus is significantly smaller than that from Streptococcus pyogenes (3,159 vs. 4,104 base pairs), and this is important when working with AAV as a delivery vector, which has an effective packaging limit of approximately 4,700 base pairs. Secondly, identifying Cas9 enzymes with different editing properties will expand the number of potential editing sites in the human genome. As shown below, we have been able to demonstrate that S. aureus Cas9 has cutting efficiency, as measured by percentage editing of DNA at specific target sites, substantially similar to that of the Cas9 enzyme from S. pyogenes , broadening the available range of sequences we are able to target under our genome editing platform. 

&#160; 

Comparison of Editing of Target Genes by S. pyogenes &#160; and &#160; S. aureus &#160; Cas9 Enzymes 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In order to accelerate and standardize the selection of guide RNAs, we have created proprietary analytical software that supports guide RNA design through single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, specificity prediction, and assessment of relative importance of potential off target sites. We have also advanced the engineering of guide RNAs such that we are able to produce molecules with suitable properties for use in human cells which have the potential to reduce the innate immune response associated with foreign RNA. This, coupled with active, purified protein enables efficient genome editing for ex vivo applications in human cells and has the potential to improve the safety and efficacy of the medicines we develop. 

&#160; 

Delivery 

&#160; 

An appropriate product configuration must be designed and optimized to provide efficient and tightly controlled delivery to the desired tissue or cell type. Two important elements of delivery are the mode of delivery to the cell and the type of molecule delivered. 

&#160; 

&#160;

There are three types of molecules that we can deliver to a cell to effect genome editing: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

DNA. If DNA is delivered, both the DNA that codes for Cas9 itself along with DNA that codes for the guide RNA(s) must be introduced into the cell. The cell can then use these DNA molecules to make the Cas9 enzyme and the guide RNA(s) and assemble them into the desired Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complex so this complex can then locate its target(s) in the cell &#8217; s genome and make the relevant edit(s). 

&#160; 

&#183; 

RNA. If RNA is delivered, both the mRNA that codes for Cas9 itself along with the guide RNA(s) must be introduced into the cell. The cell can then use the mRNA to make the Cas9 enzyme and assemble it with the guide RNA(s) to produce the desired Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complex so this complex can then locate its target(s) in the cell &#8217; s genome and make the relevant edit(s). 

&#160; 

&#183; 

RNP. Finally, if a pre &#8209;formed RNP complex is delivered, the cell is provided with an already &#8209;functional Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complex that is ready to act on target sites in the genome. 

&#160; 

The mode of delivery for the different Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complexes depends on the type of molecule (DNA, RNA, or RNP) that is delivered. Delivery can be performed through a range of approaches such as local or systemic injection in vivo or through ex vivo genome modification where cells are removed from the body, edited, and the engineered cells are given back to the patient. Delivery mode options depend on whether a therapy is being delivered in vivo or ex vivo and can include viral vectors, such as AAV, lipid nanoparticles, engineered cells, and nucleic acids. As shown below, these potential product configurations can be administered through intravenous infusion, a direct injection into a target tissue or organ, or by inhalation. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The delivery component of our genome editing platform aims to identify and develop delivery vehicles both by leveraging existing technologies, such as the electroporation system commercialized by MaxCyte, Inc., and also investing in new approaches that have the potential to be used to treat many diseases over the longer term. To this end, we have taken advantage of the smaller S. aureus Cas9 and existing AAV technology to construct an &#8220; all &#8209;in &#8209;one &#8221; viral vector that is able to deliver the DNA coding for the nuclease protein and one or two guide RNAs directly to cells. We believe our ability to configure all the components for genome editing in an &#8220; all &#8209;in &#8209;one &#8221; AAV vector has substantial advantages for manufacturing and delivery compared to approaches that rely on multiple vectors. 

&#160; 

As part of our work to establish our ability to modify genes in the liver in vivo , we have successfully delivered an all &#8209;in &#8209;one AAV vector encoding S. aureus Cas9 and a guide RNA and demonstrated efficient editing of the Factor VII gene, a target in the liver, in mice. In these experiments we evaluated three different AAV vector constructs against a control solution, which we refer to as Control 1, in each case administered by injection into the blood stream. The AAV 

&#160;

vectors evaluated in the experiments delivered either an inactive control protein, which we refer to as Control 2, S. aureus Cas9 and a selected Factor VII guide RNA, which we refer to as Guide 1, or S. aureus Cas9 and a second selected Factor VII guide RNA, which we refer to as Guide 2. In these experiments, we observed editing of the DNA for the Factor VII gene in liver tissue with low levels of editing in tissues other than the liver, as shown in the figure below. 

&#160; 

Comparison of Editing of Factor VII Gene in Various Tissues of Mice 

After Single IV Injection of All &#8209;in &#8209;One AAV 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In addition, we observed a significant reduction in serum levels of Factor VII by each of the two different guide RNAs targeting this gene, as shown in the figure below. 

&#160; 

Editing of Factor VII Gene in Liver of Mice 

After Single IV Injection of All &#8209;in &#8209;One AAV 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We believe these data represent an important proof of concept for our ability to develop genome editing medicines that can be delivered to the liver by systemic administration. In addition, the results of this study also provide a framework by which to benchmark different systemic delivery modalities designed to target a range of genes expressed in the liver. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We have also made substantial advances in the ex vivo delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 systems to mature human T cells and hematopoietic stem cells derived from the bone marrow. We have been able to demonstrate approximately 90% ex vivo editing in human T cells and greater than 45% ex vivo editing in hematopoietic stem cells using either mRNA or RNP complexes. These results are consistent across multiple cell donors and multiple target genes. We believe this supports the view that there are multiple delivery approaches that can be used to develop medicines for diseases of the blood and bone marrow. 

&#160; 

Control and Specificity 

&#160; 

Control of cellular exposure to the Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complex and specificity of the DNA cut are important to optimizing the location and duration of editing activity. We believe these features are critical to designing medicines that are both safe and effective, and we are developing and applying technologies in these areas. We strive to identify, measure, and eliminate off &#8209;target activity in a systematic and scalable manner as we optimize our molecules. To accomplish this, we have combined multiple orthogonal methods in the design, testing, and optimization process. Our strategy to assess specificity during the research stage includes: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Establish industry &#8209;leading computational tools to design guide RNAs. The guide RNA activates and directs the Cas9 enzyme to the right cutting position in the genome. It is important for the guide RNA to be highly selective to ensure that the right site is cut. For every guide RNA we test, we compare the targeted DNA sequence to the sequence of the entire human genome to identify all sequences that have significant similarity to the targeted DNA sequence. Based on our internal algorithms, we eliminate any guide RNAs that have certain defined degrees of similarity to other sites across the genome. We continually refine our guide RNA design algorithms based on results from large &#8209;scale guide RNA screens and further confirmation and refinement experiments. We expect that this will enhance our ability to design efficient and specific guide RNAs as our database expands over time. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Use multiple unbiased, comprehensive methods to empirically assess specificity in vitro. While computational tools are helpful, they are only a starting point and are insufficient to understand specificity completely. It is critical to make and test molecules in unbiased assays to assess the specificity of their activity. We intend to use multiple methods to empirically assess specificity in order to test for a variety of potential off &#8209;target cuts, at sites both similar and dissimilar to the targeted DNA site. For example, we have implemented in our laboratories a method called GUIDE &#8209;Seq, which was developed by one of our founders and works in cells in vitro. The GUIDE &#8209;Seq method identifies potential off &#8209;target cuts in DNA by inserting a small, unique piece of synthetic DNA at breaks in the cell &#8217; s genome and then sequencing the cell &#8217; s DNA near the site of insertion. A &#8220; read &#8221; is generated each time the unique piece of inserted DNA is mapped to the cell &#8217; s genome. The genomic location of the &#8220; read &#8221; indicates whether a cut was made at the intended site or at an off &#8209;target site. We have used the GUIDE &#8209;Seq method to assess the specificity of different guide RNAs targeted to the same gene. In one experiment, we evaluated three different Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complexes targeted at a single gene and observed that two of the Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complexes were able to produce targeted cuts in the DNA with no apparent off &#8209;target cut sites while the third produced two different types of off &#8209;target cuts, as shown in the figure below. 

&#160; 

Specificity Analysis by GUIDE &#8209;Seq 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We are applying this method to our early programs, including our LCA10 and engineered T cell programs. In addition, we are expanding our capabilities to include techniques other than GUIDE &#8209;Seq to assess specificity empirically. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Create validated assay panels composed of potential off &#8209;target sites identified by both computational approaches and the use of other unbiased methods. These targeted resequencing assay panels will then be applied to in vitro and in vivo experimental systems to confirm specificity as we advance to the clinic. 

&#160; 

To optimize the specificity of any product candidate we may develop, there are a number of different aspects of the product configuration that we will refine in addition to the sequence of the guide RNA. The length of the guide RNA, the type of Cas9 enzyme, the delivery vector, the use of tissue &#8209;selective promoters, and the duration of exposure all contribute to overall specificity, and we optimize each of these elements for every program. We have evaluated various forms of Cas9 enzymes and different promoters for selective expression in different cell types, which we believe have the potential to increase the tissue specificity of our medicines. We have also identified and characterized an alternate promoter system for the expression of guide RNAs to selectively enhance editing activity in targeted tissues and implemented and produced a detailed characterization of multiple distinct approaches to specificity evaluation in order to best characterize the specificity of our genome editing approaches. To reduce the persistence of genome editing activity, 

&#160;

we are developing self &#8209;regulating genome editing systems designed to deliver not only the Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complex, but also an &#8220; off switch &#8221; that reduces the presence of the Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complex over time. We have completed studies of these systems that demonstrate the ability to both maintain on &#8209;target editing and also reduce levels of editing components once the on &#8209;target edit is likely to have been completed. 

&#160; 

Directed Editing 

&#160; 

There are different mechanisms that a cell can use to repair cuts in DNA. Each mechanism results in different kinds of genetic changes. The two major DNA repair mechanisms are NHEJ and HDR. We are developing approaches to selectively harness these DNA repair mechanisms to be able to drive the appropriate type of repair for a given disease. In particular, a significant part of our effort to expand our platform is to develop methods to better direct the HDR mechanism. We are taking several approaches to improve our understanding of HDR &#8209;based DNA repair and to develop tools to influence it. The ability to direct the DNA repair mechanism is critical to achieving the broadest potential for our platform. 

&#160; 

Our initial work in directed editing has focused on the gene for HBB, which is mutated in beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease. We have investigated how different kinds of DNA cuts by a CRISPR/Cas9 molecule drive the choice of DNA repair mechanism used by the cell to repair these cuts. These experiments took advantage of the flexibility of CRISPR/Cas9 targeting as well as a series of engineered variants of the Cas9 enzyme that either cut one or both strands of the DNA double helix. The wild type Cas9 enzyme cuts both strands of DNA. Engineered variants of the Cas9 enzyme that only cut one of the two strands are called nickases. In experiments in cells, we used three different versions of the Cas9 enzyme and we designed guide RNAs to direct them to make three kinds of cuts in the HBB gene: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Blunt &#8209;Ended DNA Cut : We used the wild type Cas9 enzyme with a single guide RNA to create a cut through both strands of the DNA double helix in the same place, leaving what is referred to as a blunt end (left figure below).

3&#8217; Overhang DNA Cut : We designed two &#8220; bottom strand &#8221; Cas9 nickases so that each nickase cuts one strand of the DNA double helix and the respective guide RNAs directed them to opposite sides of the helix. These single &#8209;stranded cuts in the DNA were offset from one another by a short distance and resulted in what is termed a 3 &#8217; overhang (middle figure below).

5&#8217; Overhang DNA Cut : We designed two &#8220; top strand &#8221; Cas9 nickases so that each nickase cuts one strand of the DNA double helix and the respective guide RNAs directed them to opposite sides of the helix. Once again, these single &#8209;stranded cuts in the DNA were offset from one another by a short distance. In this case, the use of two offset, top strand nickases resulted in what is termed a 5 &#8217; overhang (right figure below). 

&#160; 

Schematic of Experiment Testing Role of Cut Type in HDR 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We applied these Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complexes to cells and assessed how the cells repaired their DNA as measured by editing of DNA for the HBB gene. In addition, we included in these studies an extra piece of DNA called a repair template. This DNA, or ssODN, contained a DNA sequence that we could detect so that we could determine if the cell used the ssODN piece of DNA in the repair process. The results of this experiment are shown in the figure below. 

&#160; 

Comparison of Different Hemoglobin Beta 

Gene Editing Outcomes 

&#160; 

&#160; 

These studies demonstrated that the cells used different DNA repair mechanisms to edit the HBB gene depending on the type of DNA cut. Importantly, in response to a 5 &#8217; overhang cut, the cells used the HDR process much more often than in response to the other types of cuts. The cells used the experimentally supplied ssODN piece of DNA as the template for HDR fairly frequently (23%). In addition, there was a relatively high frequency (25%) of a phenomenon known as gene conversion. In the case of gene conversion, the template for repair was the gene for hemoglobin delta (HBD), a gene that is physically close and highly similar to the HBB gene. 

&#160; 

These results show the flexibility of CRISPR/Cas9 technology in creating multiple cut types and demonstrate that different cut types can result in profoundly different gene repair outcomes. In addition, the observed use of nearby very similar DNA from the HBD gene sequences suggests that a more generalizable approach to gene correction may be possible by designing cuts that drive cells to repair mutations from pre &#8209;existing DNA sequences that are appropriately co &#8209;located. Based in part on these observations, we are seeking to drive HDR &#8209;based repair by developing engineered DNA repair templates as well as tethering DNA repair templates to the Cas9 &#8209;guide RNA complex. We believe that our ability to understand and harness the editing mechanisms used by cells creates opportunities to improve our existing programs and opens up new opportunities to develop medicines.

Juno Therapeutics Collaboration and License Agreement 

&#160; 

In May 2015, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Juno Therapeutics for the research and development of engineered T cells with chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs, and T cell receptors, or TCRs, that have been genetically modified to recognize and kill other cells. In particular, Juno Therapeutics and we will research and develop CAR and TCR engineered T cell products across three research programs over a five &#8209;year period, ending on May 26, 2020. Juno Therapeutics has the option to extend the research period through May 26, 2022, upon payment of 

&#160;

one &#8209;year extension fees in the mid &#8209;single &#8209;digit millions of dollars per year. We refer to the five &#8209; to seven &#8209;year period as the research program term of the collaboration. 

&#160; 

During the research program term, we are responsible for generating genome editing reagents that modify gene targets selected by Juno Therapeutics. Juno Therapeutics is responsible for evaluating and selecting for further research and development CAR and TCR engineered T cell products modified with our genome editing reagents. Except for our obligations under the mutually agreed research plan, Juno Therapeutics has sole responsibility, at its own cost, for the worldwide development, manufacturing, and commercialization of the selected CAR and TCR engineered T cell products for the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of any cancer in humans, excluding the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of medullary cystic kidney disease 1, which we refer to as the exclusive field. 

&#160; 

Under the collaboration agreement, we granted to Juno Therapeutics an exclusive (even as to us), worldwide, milestone and royalty &#8209;bearing, sublicensable license to certain of our owned and in &#8209;licensed patent rights to research, develop, make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell and import selected CAR and TCR engineered T cell products in the exclusive field. In addition, we granted to Juno Therapeutics a non &#8209;exclusive, worldwide, milestone and royalty &#8209;bearing, sublicensable license to certain of our owned and in &#8209;licensed patent rights to use genome editing reagents that are used in the creation of a CAR or TCR engineered T cell product on which Juno Therapeutics has filed an IND for the treatment or prevention of a cancer in humans for researching, developing, making, having made, using, offering for sale, selling, and importing that CAR or TCR engineered T cell product in all fields outside of the exclusive field, excluding the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of medullary cystic kidney disease 1. We further granted to Juno Therapeutics a non &#8209;exclusive, worldwide, non &#8209;sublicensable license to certain of our owned and in &#8209;licensed patent rights to, among other things, conduct the activities assigned to Juno under the mutually agreed research plan and to our genome editing reagents for further research and development of CAR and TCR engineered T cell products. Juno Therapeutics granted to us a non &#8209;exclusive, worldwide, royalty &#8209;free, and non &#8209;sublicensable license to certain Juno Therapeutics patents solely for the purpose of our conducting the research activities assigned to us under the mutually agreed research plan. 

&#160; 

During the research program term and except pursuant to the collaboration agreement, we may not conduct or participate in, and may not license, fund or otherwise enable a third party to conduct or participate in, research, development, manufacture, or commercialization of CAR and TCR engineered T cells in the exclusive field. In addition, we may not enter into any collaboration, license, or other relationship with a third party to use our genome editing technology with respect to CAR and TCR engineered T cells in any other field, excluding the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of medullary cystic kidney disease 1, unless we first provide written notice to Juno Therapeutics and provide Juno Therapeutics an opportunity to discuss a comparable collaboration, license, or other relationship. Juno Therapeutics has agreed to certain exclusivity obligations with us with respect to certain gene editing technologies. 

&#160; 

During the term of the collaboration agreement and except pursuant to the collaboration agreement, we may not conduct or participate in, and may not license, fund, or otherwise enable a third party to conduct or participate in, research, development, manufacturing, or commercialization activities involving the use of our genome editing technology, or any genome editing technology similar to ours, with respect to the gene targets selected by Juno Therapeutics during the research program term for further research and development in the exclusive field. During the term of the collaboration agreement and except pursuant to the collaboration agreement, we may not conduct or participate in, and may not license, fund, or otherwise enable a third party to conduct or participate in, research, development, manufacturing, or commercialization activities with respect to a certain type of CAR or TCR engineered T cell product for use in the exclusive field, where such product targets a protein designated by Juno Therapeutics during the research program term as a target for Juno Therapeutics &#8217; further research and development of that certain type of CAR or TCR engineered T cell product. 

&#160; 

Juno Therapeutics and we each must use diligent efforts to perform all activities for which Juno Therapeutics or we are responsible under the collaboration. Juno Therapeutics also is required to achieve certain regulatory objectives with respect to the engineered T cells in each of the three programs by specified dates. Under the agreement, if Juno Therapeutics does not meet its initial regulatory objective by the required date with respect to an engineered T cell in a specified program, then we can, as our exclusive remedy to Juno Therapeutics &#8217; failure, convert the exclusive license we granted to Juno Therapeutics to a non &#8209;exclusive license to Juno Therapeutics with respect to the particular program to which Juno Therapeutics &#8217; failure relates. If Juno Therapeutics does not meet a subsequent regulatory objective with 

&#160;

respect to an engineered T cell within a program, then we can, as our exclusive remedy to Juno Therapeutics &#8217; failure, convert the exclusive license we granted to Juno Therapeutics to a non &#8209;exclusive license to Juno Therapeutics with respect to the particular engineered T cell to which Juno Therapeutics &#8217; failure relates. 

&#160; 

The collaboration is supervised by a joint research committee, or JRC, comprising an equal number of representatives from each of Juno Therapeutics and us. The JRC oversees and coordinates research activities during the research program term. Moreover, each party will appoint a project leader and the project leaders will be responsible for, among other things, coordinating the day &#8209;to &#8209;day work and raising cross &#8209;party disputes in a timely manner. Decisions of the JRC are made by unanimous vote, with each of Juno Therapeutics and us having one vote. If the JRC is not able to reach a unanimous decision, Juno Therapeutics &#8217; and our respective chief executive officers will attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith. If the chief executive officers cannot resolve the dispute, subject to certain requirements, Juno Therapeutics has the final decision making authority with respect to disputes relating to the development of the licensed products within the research plan, and we have the final decision making authority with respect to disputes relating to our patents, know &#8209;how and technology. 

&#160; 

Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we received an upfront payment of $25.0 million from Juno Therapeutics. In addition, we will receive up to $22.0 milli on in research support over a five year period across the three programs under our collaboration, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the agreement. We are eligible to receive future research and regulatory milestones of approximately $160 million for each of the first products developed in each of the three research programs and additional, reduced research and regulatory milestones for subsequent products. We also are eligible to receive future commercial sales milestones of $75 million based on certain specified thresholds of aggregate, worldwide net sales of all engineered T cell products within each of the three research programs. Further, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties of low double &#8209;digit percentages of Juno Therapeutics &#8217; net sales of products licensed under our collaboration agreement. Juno Therapeutics &#8217; obligation to pay royalties on a licensed product will expire on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis upon the later of the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product and the expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents covering such licensed product. If Juno Therapeutics is required to pay royalties on net sales of a licensed product to a third party because the licensed product is covered under the third party &#8217; s patent, then Juno Therapeutics can credit a certain percentage of its payments to the third party against the royalties it owes us, subject to certain maximum deduction limits. 

&#160; 

We will own any inventions developed by our employees and agents during our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics. Juno Therapeutics and we will jointly own any inventions made jointly by employees or agents of Juno Therapeutics and us during our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics. We retain control, at our own cost, of the prosecution and maintenance of our solely owned patents. Juno Therapeutics and we will be jointly responsible for the prosecution and maintenance of any jointly owned patents. We hold the final decision making authority with respect to claims of jointly owned patents relating to our genome editing technology and Juno Therapeutics holds the final decision making authority with respect to claims of jointly owned patents relating to CAR and TCR engineered T cell products. 

&#160; 

Unless terminated earlier, the term of the collaboration agreement will expire on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis until the date no further payments are due to us from Juno Therapeutics. Juno Therapeutics may terminate the agreement for convenience in its entirety upon six months &#8217; written notice to us. Either Juno Therapeutics or we may terminate the agreement if the other party is in material breach and fails to cure such breach within the specified cure period. Either Juno Therapeutics or we may terminate the agreement in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party. 

&#160; 

If Juno Therapeutics terminates the agreement as a result of our uncured material breach, Juno Therapeutics &#8217; rights and licenses to our specified patent rights, Juno Therapeutics &#8217; obligations to pay us certain research milestones and royalties, and Juno Therapeutics &#8217; rights to prosecute, maintain, and enforce certain patent rights each continue as set forth under the agreement. If Juno Therapeutics terminates the agreement for convenience or we terminate the agreement as a result of Juno Therapeutics &#8217; uncured material breach, the licenses we granted to Juno Therapeutics will terminate. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in the gene therapy and genome &#8209;editing fields, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on intellectual property and proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience, and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 

&#160; 

We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other related markets that utilize technologies encompassing genomic medicines to create therapies, including genome editing and gene therapy. There are additional companies that are working to develop therapies in areas related to our research programs. 

&#160; 

Our platform and product focus is the development of therapies using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Other companies developing CRISPR/Cas9 technology include Caribou Biosciences, CRISPR Therapeutics, and Intellia Therapeutics. In addition, there have been and may continue to be discoveries of new CRISPR &#8209;based gene editing technologies, such as the recently discovered nuclease Cpf1. Cpf1 is early in its scientific characterization; however, its researchers have asserted that it might provide advantages over Cas9 in genome editing applications, including that Cpf1 requires only one guide RNA in contrast to the two guide RNAs required with Cas9, which could simplify the design and delivery of genome &#8209;editing tools, and that Cpf1 generates staggered DNA cuts in contrast to the blunt &#8209;end cuts generated by Cas9, which could be advantageous for facilitating NHEJ &#8209;based gene insertion. 

&#160; 

There are additional companies developing therapies using additional genome editing technologies, including TALENs, meganucleases, Mega &#8209;TALs, and zinc finger nucleases. Potential advantages of these additional genome editing technologies include their degree of scientific characterization to date, which may allow for more rapid development of subsequent programs; the range of sites that each is able to recognize and the location of the DNA cut relative to the recognition sequence, each of which may allow for a different range of targets to be addressed; and the orientation of the DNA ends that are left behind after cutting. The companies developing these additional genome editing technologies include bluebird bio, Cellectis, Poseida Therapeutics, Precision Biosciences, and Sangamo Biosciences. Additional companies developing gene therapy products include Abeona Therapeutics, AGTC Therapeutics, Avalanche Biotechnologies, Dimension Therapeutics, REGENXBIO, Spark Therapeutics, uniQure, and Voyager Therapeutics. In addition to competition from other genome editing therapies or gene therapies, any products that we develop may also face competition from other types of therapies, such as small molecule, antibody, or protein therapies. 

&#160; 

Caribou Biosciences, CRISPR Therapeutics, and Intellia Therapeutics have all reported that they have obtained licenses to a family of patent applications that was filed by the University of California, the University of Vienna, and Emmanuelle Charpentier and has an earliest priority date which pre &#8209;dates the priority dates of our in &#8209;licensed patents and patent applications. CRISPR Therapeutics has reported that it has an exclusive license to patent rights from Emmanuelle Charpentier. Caribou Biosciences has reported that it has an exclusive license to patent rights from the University of California and the University of Vienna. Intellia Therapeutics has reported that it has an exclusive license to such rights from Caribou Biosciences in certain fields. The University of California derives rights in such applications from an assignment by Dr. Jennifer Doudna and certain other inventors listed on such applications. Dr. Doudna was a founder of our company and entered into a consulting agreement with us at the time of our founding. However, Dr. Doudna gave notice of termination of that agreement in May 2014 after less than seven months of service, and she has had no further engagement in our business since that time. Dr. Doudna is also a founder of Caribou Biosciences and has been publicly identified as an advisor to Intellia Therapeutics. For more information regarding the risks associated with third party intellectual property, please see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property. &#8221; 

&#160; 

In addition, many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and gene therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early &#8209;stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly 

&#160;

through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, and availability of reimbursement. 

&#160; 

If our current programs are approved for the indications for which we are currently planning clinical trials, they may compete with other products currently under development, including genome editing and gene therapy products. Competition with other related products currently under development may include competition for clinical trial sites, patient recruitment, and product sales. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our platform technology, programs, and know &#8209;how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, exclusively licensing and filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our platform technology, existing and planned programs, and improvements that are important to the development of our business, where patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets, know &#8209;how, continuing technological innovation, and confidential information to develop and maintain our proprietary position and protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. 

&#160; 

Our in &#8209;licensed patents cover various aspects of our genome editing platform technology, including CRISPR/Cas9 systems that employ viral vectors for delivery, single guide RNAs, modified guide RNAs, S. aureus Cas9, or a Cas9 nickase. In addition, we have filed patent applications and have in &#8209;licensed rights to filed patent applications directed to each of the four components of our genome editing platform technology. We intend to pursue, when possible, additional patent protection, including composition of matter, method of use, and process claims, directed to each component of our platform technology. We also intend to obtain rights to existing delivery technologies through one or more licenses from third parties. 

&#160; 

Notwithstanding these efforts, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we have licensed or filed or may license or file in the future, and we cannot be sure that any patents we have licensed or patents that may be licensed or granted to us in the future will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. Moreover, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property. &#8221; 

&#160; 

As of February 29, 2016 , we owned two pending U.S. non &#8209;provisional patent applications, 14 pending U.S. provisional patent applications, and 15 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications which include claims to compositions of matter and methods of use. With respect to one of these pending U.S. non &#8209;provisional applications and its corresponding pending PCT application, we have determined that certain of the claims of such applications cover subject matter invented jointly by us and other third parties, which will result in certain third parties holding co &#8209;ownership rights in such applications. Therefore, we intend to update these applications to reflect such joint inventorship and seek a license to such co &#8209;ownership rights from such third parties. We intend to pursue, when possible, 

&#160;

composition of matter, method of use, dosing, and formulation patent protection for genome editing products that we develop during the course of our business. 

&#160; 

As of February 29, 2016 , we in &#8209;licensed 24 U.S. patents, which include claims to compositions of matter, methods of use, and certain processes as well as approximately 76 pending U.S. patent applications, four European patents and related validations, 45 pending European patent applications, six pending PCT applications, and other related patent applications in jurisdictions outside the United States and Europe, which include claims to compositions of matter, methods of use, and certain processes. The patents and patent applications outside of the United States and Europe are held primarily in Canada, Japan, and Australia, although some of our in &#8209;licensed patent families were filed in a larger number of countries. Our in &#8209;licensed patents and patent applications claim the inventions of investigators at The Broad Institute Inc., or Broad, President and Fellows of Harvard College, or Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, The General Hospital Corporation d/b/a Massachusetts General Hospital, or MGH, and Duke University, or Duke, and the majority of these licensed patents and patent applications are licensed on an exclusive basis. The exclusive licenses are, in some cases, limited to certain technical fields. Certain patent applications licensed to us by Broad (including a continuation of one of these applications) include Rockefeller as a joint applicant. Broad does not and does not purport to grant any rights in Rockefeller &#8217; s interest in these patent applications under our agreement. As a result, Broad may not be the sole and exclusive owner of any patents that issue from these patent applications. For more information regarding these license agreements, please see &#8220;Item 1. Business &#8212; License Agreements. &#8221; 

&#160; 

On January 11, 2016, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the USPTO, or PTAB, declared an interference between a pending U.S. patent application (U.S. Serial No. 13/842,859) that is owned by the University of California, the University of Vienna, and Emmanuelle Charpentier and 12 U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,697,359; 8,771,945; 8,795,965; 8,865,406; 8,871,445; 8,889,356; 8,895,308; 8,906,616; 8,932,814; 8,945,839; 8,993,233; and 8,999,641) that are co &#8209;owned by Broad and MIT, and in some cases Harvard, and in &#8209;licensed by us. On March 17, 2016, the PTAB re-declared the interference to add a pending U.S. patent application (U.S. Serial No. 14/704,551) that is co &#8209;owned by Broad, MIT, and Harvard, and in &#8209;licensed by us. &#160; An interference is a proceeding within the USPTO to determine priority of invention of the subject matter of patent claims filed by different parties. Prior to the declaration of interference, the University of California, acting on behalf of itself and the University of Vienna, and Emmanuelle Charpentier filed a &#8220; Suggestion of Interference &#8221; in the USPTO on April 13, 2015, which requested that an interference be declared between certain claims in their pending U.S. patent application (U.S. Serial No. 13/842,859) and certain claims in 10 U.S. patents, which we have in &#8209;licensed from Broad acting on behalf of itself, MIT, and Harvard. A Supplemental Suggestion of Interference was filed by the University of California and Emmanuelle Charpentier on November 5, 2015, which requested that an interference be declared between certain claims in their same pending U.S. patent application (U.S. Serial No. 13/842,859) and certain claims in two additional U.S. patents and five pending U.S. patent applications (including U.S. Serial No. 14/704,551 which has now been added to the interference) , which we have in &#8209;licensed from Broad, acting on behalf of itself, MIT, and Harvard. The 12 U.S. patents referred to in the Suggestion of Interference and Supplemental Suggestion of Interference are the same as those included in the declaration of interference. The Suggestion of Interference and Supplemental Suggestion of Interference assert that the inventors from the University of California and the University of Vienna and Emmanuelle Charpentier made certain inventions before the inventors from Broad and MIT and, in certain cases, Harvard, which will be evaluated in the interference. The University of California derives rights in U.S. Serial No. 13/842,859 from an assignment by Dr. Jennifer Doudna and certain of the other inventors listed on such application. Dr. Doudna was a founder of our company and entered into a consulting agreement with us at the time of our founding. However, Dr. Doudna gave notice of termination of that agreement in May 2014 after less than seven months of service, and she has had no further engagement in our business since that time. Dr. Doudna is also a founder of Caribou Biosciences and has been publicly identified as an advisor to Intellia Therapeutics, each of which is one of our competitors. 

&#160; 

Separately, ToolGen filed Suggestions of Interference in the USPTO on April 13, 2015, which became publicly available on November 12, 2015 and December 3, 2015, suggesting that it believes some of the claims pending in its applications (U.S. Serial No. 14/685,568 and U.S. Serial No. 14/685,510, respectively) interfere with certain claims in five U.S. patents, which we have in &#8209;licensed from Broad, acting on behalf of itself, MIT, and Harvard. These five U.S. patents are among the 12 U.S. patents with respect to which the PTAB has declared an interference. The Suggestions of Interference that were filed by ToolGen are still pending, and it is uncertain when and in what manner the USPTO will act on them. &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

A request for ex parte re-examination was filed with the USPTO on February 16, 2016 against one of the patents with respect to which the PTAB has declared an interference (U.S. Patent No. 8,771,945 ). This patent is also one of the patents that ToolGen has included in its Suggestion s of Interference . Ex parte re-examination is a procedure through which a third party can anonymously request the USPTO to re-examine a granted patent because the third party believes the granted patent may not be patentable over prior art in the form of a printed publication or another patent. Before the USPTO will re-examine a granted patent, the third party requestor must establish that the submitted prior art establishes a substantial and new question of patentability. If the USPTO determines there is a substantial and new question of patentability, it will grant the re-examination request and re-examine the patent in question. The third party requestor does not participate in the re-examination procedure after filing the request. The request for ex parte re-examination is still pending, and it is uncertain when and in what manner the USPTO will act on it. 

&#160; 

The 12 in &#8209;licensed U.S. patents and pending U.S. patent application that are the subject of the interference with the pending U.S. patent application (U.S. Serial No. 13/842,859) that is owned by the University of California, the University of Vienna, and Emmanuelle Charpentier (which includes the five in &#8209;licensed U.S. patents that are the subject of the Suggestions of Interference filed by ToolGen and the one in-licensed U.S. patent that is the subject of the request for ex parte re-examination ) relate generally to the CRISPR/Cas9 system and its use in eukaryotic cells. The claims of the 12 in &#8209;licensed U.S. patents and pending U.S. patent application vary in scope and coverage and include claims that are directed to CRISPR/Cas9 systems that employ viral vectors for delivery, single guide RNAs, modified guide RNAs, S. aureus Cas9, or a Cas9 nickase and are relevant to our genome editing platform technology. The loss of one or more of these in &#8209;licensed patents could have a material adverse effect on the conduct of our business. 

&#160; 

In addition, we or our licensors may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators, or other third parties have an interest in our owned or in &#8209;licensed patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co &#8209;inventor. For example, we have determined that certain of the claims of one of our pending U.S. non &#8209;provisional patent applications, and its corresponding pending PCT application, cover subject matter invented jointly by us and other third parties, which will result in certain third parties holding co &#8209;ownership rights in such applications. If we are unable to obtain an exclusive license to any such third party co &#8209;owners &#8217; interest in such patent applications, such co &#8209;owners may be able to license their rights to other third parties, including our competitors. In addition, we may need the cooperation of any such co &#8209;owners to enforce any patents that issue from such patent applications against third parties, and such cooperation may not be provided to us. We are also aware of one third party, Rockefeller, that has independently filed a U.S. patent application (U.S. Serial No. 14/324,960) as a continuation of a U.S. patent application that we have in &#8209;licensed from Broad , acting on behalf of itself and MIT (U.S. Serial No. 14/183,429, which has since issued as U.S. Patent No. 8,771,945). In contrast to a Suggestion of Interference, a U.S. continuation patent application does not seek to challenge the priority date of an existing patent, rather it is a new filing of an existing U.S. patent application, which contains the same priority date as the existing application. However, it may provoke the declaration of an interference. In that regard, the U.S. continuation patent application filed by Rockefeller lists one of its employees as a co &#8209;inventor alongside Dr. Feng Zhang, who is an employee of Broad in addition to being one of our founders. The U.S. continuation patent application was filed by Rockefeller with copies of claims from one U.S. patent and one U.S. patent application , which we have in &#8209;licensed from Broad, acting on behalf of itself and MIT (U.S. Patent No. 8,697,359 and U.S. Serial No. 14/183,429, which has since issued as U.S. Patent No. 8,771,945). The U.S. continuation patent application filed by Rockefeller may provoke the declaration of an interference by the USPTO with these or other patents that we have in &#8209;licensed from Broad, acting on behalf of itself, MIT, and Harvard. The U.S. continuation application filed by Rockefeller may also prompt a derivation proceeding in the USPTO or litigation in court regarding such continuation patent application. In addition, if the USPTO were to grant a patent based on this U.S. continuation patent application including the Rockefeller employee as an inventor, then Rockefeller could license its rights to such patent to one of our competitors or to another third party such that they may have freedom &#8209;to &#8209;operate under such patent and may commercialize similar or identical products and technology to us. We may also need the cooperation of Rockefeller to enforce such patent against third parties, and such cooperation may not be provided to us. 

&#160; 

We or our licensors are subject to and may also become a party to similar proceedings or priority disputes in Europe or other foreign jurisdictions. We are aware of nine oppositions filed by different third parties against a European patent that we in &#8209;license from Broad , acting on behalf of itself, MIT and Harvard (European Patent No. EP 2,771,468 B1). The European Patent Office Opposition Division, or EPO OD, has sent a Communication of Notice of Opposition 

&#160;

to Broad informing Broad of the nine oppositions and that an opposition proceeding in the EPO OD has been initiated. The EPO opposition proceeding may involve issues including, but not limited to, procedural formalities related to filing the European patent application, priority, and the patentability of the involved claims. We are also aware of eight oppositions filed by third parties against a second European patent that we in &#8209;license from Broad , acting on behalf of itself, MIT and Harvard (European Patent No. EP 2,784,162 B1). One or more of the third parties that have filed oppositions against European Patent Nos. EP 2,771,468 B1 or EP 2,784,162 B1 or other third parties may file future oppositions against other European patents that we in &#8209;license or own. The loss of priority for, or the loss of, these European patents could have a material adverse effect on the conduct of our business. 

&#160; 

For more information regarding the risks associated with the declared interference, the Suggestions of Interference, the continuation patent application filed by Rockefeller, the European oppositions , the request for ex parte re-examination, and other potential third party intellectual property related disputes, please see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property. &#8221; 

&#160; 

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non &#8209;provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent &#8217; s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug or a method for using it may be extended. 

&#160; 

CRISPR/Cas9 

&#160; 

As of February 29, 2016 , we owned two pending U.S. non &#8209;provisional patent applications, 14 pending U.S. provisional patent applications, and 15 pending PCT patent applications that are related to our CRISPR/Cas9 technology and which include claims directed to our genome editing platform, including our directed editing component, as well as composition of matter and method of use claims for our therapeutic programs, including LCA10 and other genetic and infectious eye disorders, and engineered T cells. With respect to one &#160; of these pending U.S. non &#8209;provisional applications and its corresponding pending PCT application, we have determined that certain of the claims of such applications cover subject matter invented jointly by us and other third parties, which will result in certain third parties holding co &#8209;ownership rights in such applications. Therefore, we intend to update these applications to reflect such joint inventorship and seek a license to such co &#8209;ownership rights from such third parties. If issued as U.S. patents, and if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid, these U.S. patent applications would be expected to expire between 2034 and 2036, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. 

&#160; 

As of February 29, 2016 , we in &#8209;licensed 20 U.S. patents, four European patents and related validations, and over 300 pending patent applications, including 62 pending U.S. patent applications, 35 pending European patent applications, six pending PCT patent applications, and other related patent applications in jurisdictions outside the United States and Europe that are related to our CRISPR/Cas9 technology collectively from Broad, Harvard, MIT, MGH, and Duke, as more fully described below. The claims from our in &#8209;licensed portfolio include claims to compositions of matter, methods of use, and certain processes. These include claims directed to CRISPR/Cas9 systems that employ viral vectors for delivery, single guide RNAs, modified guide RNAs, S. aureus Cas9, or a Cas9 nickase. Our current in &#8209;licensed U.S. patents, if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid, are expected to expire between 2033 and 2034, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. 

&#160; 

LCA10 

&#160; 

As of February 29, 2016 , we owned one pending U.S. patent application and one pending PCT patent application which are directed to compositions of matter, including guide RNAs directed to CEP290, and methods of use for the treatment of LCA10. If issued as a U.S. patent, and if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid, the U.S. patent 

&#160;

application would be expected to expire in 2035, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. 

&#160; 

Trademarks 

&#160; 

As of February 29, 2016, o ur registered trademark portfolio consisted of two registered trademarks and one pending trademark application in the United States for the mark EDITAS and one corresponding registered trademark in each of Australia, China, Europe, Japan, and Switzerland. 

&#160; 

License Agreements 

&#160; 

We are a party to a number of license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property from third parties. The licensed intellectual property covers, in part, CRISPR/Cas9 and TAL &#8209;related compositions of matter and their use for genome editing. These licenses impose various diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future. We consider the following license agreements to be material to our business. 

&#160; 

The Broad Institute and President and Fellows of Harvard College License Agreement 

&#160; 

In October 2014, we entered into a license agreement with The Broad Institute, Inc., or Broad, and President and Fellows of Harvard College, or Harvard, for specified patent rights, which include rights to certain patents solely owned by Harvard, which we refer to as Harvard Patent Rights, certain patents co &#8209;owned by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, and Broad, which we refer to as MIT/Broad Patent Rights, and certain patents co &#8209;owned by MIT, Broad and Harvard, which we refer to as the Harvard/MIT/Broad Patent Rights. We refer to all the patents and patent applications licensed to us under the license agreement as the Harvard/Broad Patent Rights. Certain patent applications licensed to us by Broad (including a continuation of one of these applications) include Rockefeller as a joint applicant. Broad does not and does not purport to grant any rights in Rockefeller &#8217; s interest in these patent applications under our agreement. As a result, Broad may not be the sole and exclusive owner of any patents that issue from these patent applications. For more information regarding the risks associated with Rockefeller &#8217; s interest in these patent applications, please see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property &#8212; Our rights to develop and commercialize our technology and product candidates are subject, in part, to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by others. &#8221; 

&#160; 

The Harvard/Broad Patent Rights are directed, in part, to certain CRISPR/Cas9 and transcription activator &#8209;like effector (TALE) &#8209;related compositions of matter and their use for genome editing and to certain CRISPR/Cas9 and TALE &#8209;related delivery technologies. Pursuant to this license agreement, and as of February 29, 2016 , we have certain rights under 24 U.S. patents, 62 pending U.S. patent applications, four European patents and related validations, 35 pending European patent applications, 5 pending PCT applications, and other related patent applications in jurisdictions outside of the United States and Europe. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the license agreement, Harvard and Broad granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty &#8209;bearing, sublicensable license to the Harvard/Broad Patent Rights to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, have sold, import, and export products and services in the field of the prevention and treatment of human disease, subject to certain limitations and retained rights. The exclusive license granted by Broad and Harvard excludes certain fields, including the modification of animals or animal cells for the creation and sale of organs suitable for xenotransplantation into humans and the development and commercialization of products or services in the field of livestock applications. Moreover, the license granted by Broad is non &#8209;exclusive with respect to the treatment of medullary cystic kidney disease 1. We have also confirmed with Broad and Harvard that we are not using, and will not use, the licensed technology for human germline modification, including modifying the DNA of human embryos or human reproductive cells. Harvard and Broad also granted us a non &#8209;exclusive, worldwide, royalty &#8209;bearing, sublicensable license to the Harvard/Broad Patent Rights for all purposes, with the exception that the non &#8209;exclusive license to certain Harvard Patent Rights excludes the modification of animals or animal cells for the creation and sale of organs suitable for xenotransplantation into humans and the development and commercialization of products or services in the field of livestock applications. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, and commercialize products for the prevention or treatment of human disease under the license agreement. Also, we are required to achieve certain development milestones within specified time periods for products incorporating the CRISPR/Cas9, TAL, and delivery &#8209;related technologies covered by the Harvard/Broad Patent Rights. Harvard and Broad have the right to terminate our license with respect to the Harvard/Broad Patent Rights covering the technology or technologies with respect to which we fail to achieve these development milestones. 

&#160; 

The licenses granted by Broad and Harvard to us under the license agreement are subject to any retained rights of the U.S. government in the Harvard/Broad Patent Rights and the rights retained by Broad, Harvard, and MIT on behalf of themselves and other academic, government and non &#8209;profit entities, to practice the Harvard/Broad Patent Rights for research, educational, or teaching uses. In addition, certain rights granted to us under the license agreement are further subject to a non &#8209;exclusive license to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for research purposes. Our exclusive license rights also are subject to rights retained by Broad, Harvard, and MIT and any third party to research, develop, make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, have sold, import or otherwise exploit the Harvard/Broad Patent Rights and licensed products as research products or research tools, or for research purposes. In addition, Broad does not and does not purport to grant any rights in Rockefeller &#8217; s interest in the patent applications licensed to us by Broad (including a continuation of one of these applications) that include Rockefeller as a joint applicant. 

&#160; 

We have the right to sublicense our licensed rights provided that the sublicense agreement must be in compliance and consistent with the terms of the license agreement. Any sublicense agreement cannot include the right to grant further sublicenses without the written consent of Broad and Harvard. In addition, any sublicense agreements must contain certain terms, including a provision requiring the sublicensee to indemnify Harvard, Broad, MIT, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute according to the same terms as are provided in our license agreement and a statement that Broad, Harvard, MIT, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute are intended third party beneficiaries of the sublicense agreement for certain purposes. 

&#160; 

Under the agreement, Harvard and Broad also retained rights to grant further licenses under specified circumstances to third parties, other than specified entities, that wish to develop and commercialize products that target a particular gene and that otherwise would fall within the scope of our exclusive license from Harvard and Broad. If, after a specified period of time, a third party requests a license under the Harvard/Broad Patent Rights for the development and commercialization of a product that would be subject to our exclusive license grant from Harvard and Broad, Harvard and Broad may notify us of the request. We refer to these requests as Third Party Proposed Product Requests. A Third Party Proposed Product Request must be accompanied by a research, development and commercialization plan reasonably satisfactory to Harvard and Broad, including evidence that the third party has, or reasonably expects to have, access to any necessary intellectual property and funding. Harvard and Broad may not grant a Third Party Proposed Product Request if our collaborators or we are researching, developing, or commercializing a product directed to the same gene target as the product that is the subject of the Third Party Proposed Product Request. If we, directly or through any of our affiliates or sublicensees, are not researching, developing or commercializing a product directed to the same gene target that is the subject of the Third Party Proposed Product Request, which we refer to as a Licensee Product, and we wish to do so either alone or with a collaboration partner, Harvard and Broad may not grant the Third Party Proposed Product Request if we can demonstrate to Harvard and Broad &#8217; s reasonable satisfaction that we are interested in researching, developing, and commercializing a Licensee Product, that we have a commercially reasonable research, development, and commercialization plan to do so, and we commence and continue reasonable commercial efforts under the plan. If our collaborators and we are neither researching, developing or commercializing a Licensee Product nor able to develop and implement a plan reasonably satisfactory to Harvard and Broad, Harvard and Broad may grant a license to the third party on a gene target &#8209;by &#8209;gene target basis. If the license granted to the third party is exclusive, it shall be on milestone and royalty terms that taken as a whole are no more favorable to the third party than those provided in our license agreement and shall require such third party to use commercially reasonable efforts to implement the research, development and commercialization plan submitted by the third party to Harvard and Broad. 

&#160; 

Under the license agreement, we paid Broad and Harvard an upfront license fee in the low six figures and issued a single &#8209;digit percentage of shares of our common stock to Broad (with Broad holding a right to request re &#8209;issuance to its designees, including MIT or MIT &#8217; s designee) and Harvard. We also must pay an annual license maintenance fee ranging from the low &#8209; to mid &#8209;five figures to the low &#8209;six figures, depending on the calendar year, beginning in 2016. This annual 

&#160;

license maintenance fee is creditable against royalties owed on products and services in the same year as the maintenance fee is paid. We are obligated to reimburse Broad and Harvard for expenses associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the Harvard/Broad Patent Rights, including expenses associated with any interference proceedings in the USPTO, any opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, or EPO, or any other inter partes or other post grant proceedings in these or other jurisdictions where we are seeking patent protection. Therefore, we are obligated to reimburse Broad and/or Harvard for expenses associated with the interference and opposition proceedings involving patents licensed to us under this agreement (described in more detail in &#8220;Item 3. Legal Proceedings &#8221; ). 

&#160; 

Broad and Harvard are collectively entitled to receive clinical and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to $14.8 million in the aggregate per licensed product approved in the United States, European Union and Japan for the prevention or treatment of a human disease that afflicts at least a specified number of patients in the aggregate in the United States. If we undergo a change of control during the term of the license agreement, these clinical and regulatory milestone payments will be increased by a certain percentage in the mid double &#8209;digits. We are also obligated to make additional payments to Broad and Harvard, collectively, of up to an aggregate of $54.0 million upon the occurrence of certain sales milestones per licensed product for the prevention or treatment of a human disease that afflicts at least a specified number of patients in the aggregate in the United States. Broad and Harvard are collectively entitled to receive clinical and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to $4.1 million in the aggregate per licensed product approved in the United States and at least one jurisdiction outside the United States for the prevention or treatment of a human disease that afflicts fewer than a specified number of patients in the aggregate in the United States or a specified number of patients per year in the United States, which we refer to as an ultra &#8209;orphan disease. We are also obligated to make additional payments to Broad and Harvard, collectively, of up to an aggregate of $36.0 million upon the occurrence of certain sales milestones per licensed product for the prevention or treatment of an ultra &#8209;orphan disease. 

&#160; 

Broad and Harvard, collectively, are entitled to receive mid single &#8209;digit percentage royalties on net sales of products for the prevention or treatment of human disease, and ranging from low single &#8209;digit to high single &#8209;digit percentage royalties on net sales of other products and services, made by us, our affiliates, or our sublicensees. The royalty percentage depends on the product and service, and whether such licensed product or licensed service is covered by a valid claim within the Harvard/Broad Patent Rights. If we are legally required to pay royalties to a Third Party on net sales of our products because such third party holds patent rights that cover such licensed product, then we can credit up to a mid double &#8209;digit percentage of the amount paid to such third party against the royalties due to Harvard and Broad in the same period. Our obligation to pay royalties will expire on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis upon the later of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the Harvard/Broad Patent Rights that cover the composition, manufacture, or use of each covered product or service in each country or the tenth anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the product or service. If we sublicense any of the Harvard/Broad Patent Rights to a third party pursuant to our exclusive license under the license agreement, Broad and Harvard, collectively, have the right to receive a low double &#8209;digit percentage of the sublicense income, which percentage decreases to a high single &#8209;digit percentage for products for the prevention or treatment of human disease under sublicenses executed after we meet certain clinical milestones. 

&#160; 

Broad and Harvard retain control of the prosecution of their respective patent rights. If an interference is declared or a derivation proceeding is initiated, with respect to any Harvard/Broad Patent Rights, then our prosecution related rights, including our right to receive correspondence from a patent office, will be suspended with respect to the patent rights involved in the interference or derivation proceeding until, under some circumstances, we enter into a common interest agreement with that institution. Nevertheless, we remain responsible for the cost of such interference or derivation proceeding. On January 11, 2016, the PTAB declared an interference between a pending U.S. patent application (U.S. Serial No. 13/842,859) that is owned by the University of California, the University of Vienna, and Emmanuelle Charpentier and 12 U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,697,359; 8,771,945; 8,795,965; 8,865,406; 8,871,445; 8,889,356; 8,895,308; 8,906,616; 8,932,814; 8,945,839; 8,993,233; and 8,999,641) that are co &#8209;owned by Broad and MIT, and in some cases Harvard, and in &#8209;licensed by us under this license agreement. On March 17, 2016, the PTAB re-declared the interference to add a pending U.S. patent application (U.S. Serial No. 14/704,551) that is co-owned by Broad, MIT, and Harvard, and also in-licensed by us under this license agreement. We will be responsible for the cost of the interference proceeding with respect to these patents and this patent application . Broad and Harvard are required to maintain any application or patent within the Harvard/Broad Patents Rights so long as we meet our obligation to reimburse Broad and Harvard for expenses related to prosecution and there is a good faith basis for doing so. If we cease 

&#160;

payment for the prosecution of any Harvard/Broad Patent Right, then any license granted to us with respect to such Harvard/Broad Patent Right will terminate. 

&#160; 

We have the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce the Harvard/Broad Patent Rights with respect to our licensed products so long as certain conditions are met, such as providing Broad and Harvard with evidence demonstrating a good faith basis for bringing suit against a third party. We are solely responsible for the costs of any lawsuits we elect to initiate and cannot enter into a settlement without the prior written consent of Broad and Harvard (and MIT if applicable). Any sums recovered in such lawsuits will be shared between us, Broad, and Harvard. 

&#160; 

Unless terminated earlier, the term of the license agreement will expire on a country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis, upon the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the Harvard/Broad Patent Rights in such country. However, our royalty obligations, discussed above, may survive expiration or termination. We have the right to terminate the agreement at will upon four months &#8217; written notice to Broad and Harvard. Broad and Harvard may terminate the agreement upon a specified period of notice in the event of our uncured material breach, such notice period varying depending on the nature of the breach. Both Broad and Harvard may terminate the license agreement immediately if we challenge the enforceability, validity, or scope of any Harvard/Broad Patent Right or assist a third party to do so, or in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency. Neither Broad nor Harvard acting alone has the right to terminate the license agreement. However, Broad and Harvard may separately terminate the licenses granted to us with respect to their respective patent rights upon the occurrence of the same events that would give rise to the right of both institutions acting collectively to terminate the license agreement. 

&#160; 

The General Hospital Corporation License Agreement 

&#160; 

In August 2014, we entered into a license agreement with The General Hospital Corporation, d/b/a Massachusetts General Hospital, or MGH, for specified patent rights, which we refer to as the MGH Patent Rights, and specified know &#8209;how and biological materials. The MGH Patent Rights are directed, in part, to CRISPR/Cas9 and TALE &#8209;related compositions of matter and their use for genome editing. Pursuant to the license agreement, and as of February 29, 2016 , we have certain rights under 11 pending U.S. patent applications, eight pending European patent applications, one pending PCT application , and other related patent applications in jurisdictions outside of the United States and Europe. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the license agreement, MGH granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty &#8209;bearing, sublicensable license to the MGH Patent Rights, to make, have made, use, have used, sell, offer for sale, and import products and processes in the fields of the prevention or treatment of human or animal disease and agriculture, which includes plants and animals bred and raised for human consumption. We refer to these fields as the exclusive license field. Products and processes used for clinical diagnostic assays, and the research, development and sale of research tools, kits, and reagents in the field of agriculture are specifically excluded from our exclusive license to the MGH Patent Rights. MGH also granted us a non &#8209;exclusive, worldwide, royalty &#8209;bearing, sublicensable license to the MGH Patent Rights to make, have made, use, have used, sell, offer for sale, and import products and processes in substantially all fields other than the exclusive license field. Products and processes used for clinical diagnostic assays are specifically excluded from our non &#8209;exclusive license to the MGH Patent Rights. In addition, MGH granted us a non &#8209;exclusive, worldwide, royalty &#8209;bearing sublicensable license under specified MGH know &#8209;how and biological materials to make, have made, use, have used, sell, offer for sale, and import products and processes in all fields, except for products and processes used for clinical diagnostic assays. The licenses granted to us by MGH under the license agreement are subject to any retained rights of the U.S. government in the MGH Patent Rights and a royalty &#8209;free right of MGH, academic, and not &#8209;for &#8209;profit institutions, to practice the MGH Patent Rights for educational, research, and clinical purposes. 

&#160; 

We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, and commercialize products and processes in the exclusive license field and outside the exclusive license field under the license agreement. Also, we are required to achieve certain development milestones within specified time periods for products and processes in the exclusive license field and outside the exclusive license field. MGH has the right to terminate our license if we fail to achieve these development milestones. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Under the license agreement, we paid MGH an upfront license fee in the low six digit dollar amount and issued less than one percent of our common stock to MGH. We also must pay an annual license maintenance fee ranging from low &#8209; to mid &#8209;five digit dollar amount, depending on the calendar year, beginning in 2017. We are obligated to reimburse MGH for expenses associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the MGH Patent Rights, including expenses associated with any interference proceedings in the USPTO, any opposition proceedings in the EPO, or any other inter partes or other post grant proceedings in these or other jurisdictions where we are seeking patent protection. 

&#160; 

MGH is entitled to receive clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments totaling up to $1.4 million in the aggregate for the first licensed product or process, clinical, and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to $125,000 in the aggregate for each of the second, third, and fourth indications for which we conduct clinical trials of a licensed product or process and commercial milestone payments totaling up to $625,000 in the aggregate for each of the second, third, and fourth licensed products or process we introduce into the market. We are obligated to make additional payments to MGH of up to an aggregate of $1.8 million upon the occurrence of certain sales milestones. 

&#160; 

We are also obligated to pay MGH low single &#8209;digit percentage royalties on net sales of products for the prevention or treatment of human disease, and ranging from low single &#8209;digit to low double &#8209;digit percentage royalties on net sales of other products and services made by us, our affiliates, or our sublicensees. The royalty percentage depends on the product and service, and whether such licensed product or licensed service is covered by a valid claim within the MGH Patent Rights. If we pay royalties to a third party on net sales of our products, then we can credit up to a mid double &#8209;digit percentage of the amount paid to such third party against the royalties due to MGH. Our obligation to pay royalties will expire on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis upon the later of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the MGH Patent Rights that cover the composition, manufacture or use of each covered product or service in each country or the tenth anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the product or service. If we sublicense any of the MGH Patent Rights or know &#8209;how or materials licensed under the license agreement to a third party in the exclusive license field, MGH has the right to receive a low double &#8209;digit percentage of the sublicense income, which percentage decreases to a high single &#8209;digit percentage after a specified period of time. If we sublicense any of the MGH Patent Rights or know &#8209;how or materials licensed under the license agreement to a third party in the field of research products or processes, MGH has the right to receive a high double &#8209;digit percentage of the sublicense income. If we sublicense any of the MGH Patent Rights or know &#8209;how or materials licensed under the license agreement to a third party in any field outside the exclusive license field and outside the field of research products or processes, MGH has the right to receive a low double &#8209;digit percentage of the sublicense income. 

&#160; 

MGH retains control of the prosecution and maintenance of the MGH Patent Rights. We have the right to provide input in the prosecution of the MGH Patent Rights, including directing MGH to file and prosecute patents in certain countries. MGH controls the enforcement of the MGH Patent Rights, except for the enforcement of the rights exclusively licensed to us, which we control at our expense. We may not enter into any settlement without the prior written consent of MGH. We also retain the first right to defend against any legal or administrative action taken by a third party against an MGH Patent Right at our own costs. 

&#160; 

Unless terminated earlier, the term of the license agreement will expire, on a country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis, upon the expiration or abandonment of all MGH Patent Rights in such country. However, our royalty obligations, discussed above, may survive expiration or termination. We have the right to terminate the license agreement at will upon 90 days &#8217; written notice to MGH. MGH may terminate the license agreement upon a specified period of written notice in the event of our uncured material breach, such notice period varying depending on the nature of the breach. MGH also may terminate the license agreement immediately if we challenge the enforceability, validity, or scope of any MGH Patent Right or assist a third party to do so, or in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency. 

&#160; 

Duke University License Agreement 

&#160; 

In October 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Duke University, or Duke, for specified patent rights, which we refer to as the Duke Patent Rights, and specified know &#8209;how. The Duke Patent Rights are directed, in part, to genome editing approaches, including CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN approaches, for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Pursuant to this license agreement, and as of February 29, 2016 , we have certain rights under three pending 

&#160;

U.S. patent applications, two pending European patent applications , and other related patent applications in jurisdictions outside of the United States and Europe . 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the license agreement, Duke granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty &#8209;bearing, sublicensable license to the Duke Patent Rights, to make, have made, use, have used, sell, offer for sale, and import products and services in the field of the prevention or treatment of human disease. Research reagents are specifically excluded from our exclusive license to the Duke Patent Rights. Duke also granted us a non &#8209;exclusive and non &#8209;sublicensable license to the Duke Patent Rights for internal research in any field, including the research reagent field. In addition, Duke granted us a non &#8209;exclusive, worldwide, royalty &#8209;bearing sublicensable license under specified Duke know &#8209;how to make, have made, use, have used, sell, offer for sale, and import products and processes in field of the prevention or treatment of human disease and specifically excluding the research reagent field. The licenses granted to us by Duke under the license agreement are subject to any retained rights of the U.S. government in the Duke Patent Rights and a royalty &#8209;free right of Duke to practice or license the Duke Patent Rights for educational, research, and clinical purposes, including the right to provide licenses to governmental laboratories and other non &#8209;profit or not &#8209;for &#8209;profit institutions for non &#8209;commercial academic research purposes or other non &#8209;commercial, not &#8209;for &#8209;profit scholarly purposes. 

&#160; 

We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, and commercialize products and services in the field of the prevention or treatment of human disease. Also, we are required to achieve certain development milestones within specified time periods for products for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and for other products in the field of the prevention or treatment of human disease. Duke has the right to terminate our license if we fail to achieve these development milestones. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the license agreement, we paid Duke an upfront license fee in the high five digits. We also must pay an annual license maintenance fee ranging from mid &#8209;four digit to low &#8209;five digit dollar amount, depending on the calendar year, beginning in 2015. We are obligated to reimburse Duke for expenses associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the Duke Patent Rights. 

&#160; 

Duke is entitled to receive clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments totaling up to $625,000 in the aggregate per licensed product. We are also obligated to pay to Duke low single &#8209;digit percentage royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products and licensed services by us and our affiliates and sublicensees. If we pay royalties to a third party on net sales of a licensed product and the aggregate royalties on the net sales of the licensed product payable to all of our licensors exceeds a specified threshold, then we can credit up to a mid double &#8209;digit percentage of the amount paid to such third party against the royalties due to Duke, subject to a limitation on the amounts we may offset against our obligations to Duke that is determined with regard to the pro rata amount of the total royalties payable by us on net sales of the licensed product that are royalties payable to Duke. Our obligation to pay royalties will expire on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis upon the later of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the Duke Patent Rights that cover the composition, manufacture or use of each covered product or service in each country or the tenth anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the product or service. If we sublicense any of the Duke Patent Rights to a third party, Duke has the right to receive a low double &#8209;digit percentage of the sublicense income, the percentage of which decreases after we meet certain pre &#8209;clinical milestones. To the extent that such sublicense includes a sublicense of rights granted us to from parties other than Duke, we are entitled to assess the relative contributions of the rights licensed under the applicable agreement and apportion to Duke a lower percentage that reflects the portion of the sublicense income attributable to the Duke Patent Rights. In addition, to the extent that our collaboration and license agreement with Juno Therapeutics continues to provide for a sublicense to Juno Therapeutics of the Duke Patent Rights, we have agreed to apportion to Duke no less than a low &#8209;single &#8209;digit percentage of future non &#8209;royalty sublicense income that we receive under the agreement. 

&#160; 

Duke controls the prosecution and maintenance of the Duke Patent Rights and will prosecute and maintain the Duke Patent Rights in the United States and in specified foreign countries. We can amend the specified foreign countries to include any jurisdictions we desire to add. If a third party alleges infringement against Duke or us as a result of our or our sublicensee &#8217; s practice of the Duke Patent Rights or know &#8209;how licensed to us under the license agreement, then we will control the litigation and have the obligation to assume all costs. We further have the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce the Duke Patent Rights at our own expense. In the event a third party brings a declaratory 

&#160;

judgment action or any other action or defense alleging invalidity of the Duke Patent Rights, then Duke has the right, but not the obligation, to intervene and control the defense of the action at Duke &#8217; s own expense. 

&#160; 

Unless terminated earlier, the term of the license agreement will expire upon on a country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis, upon the expiration of the last to expire of the Duke Patent Rights in such country. However, our royalty obligations, discussed above, may survive expiration or termination. We have the right to terminate the license agreement at will upon at least two months &#8217; written notice to Duke. Duke may terminate the license agreement upon a specified period of written notice in the event of our uncured material breach, such notice period varying depending on the nature of the breach. Duke also may terminate the license agreement upon a specified period of written notice if we challenge the enforceability, validity, or scope of any Duke Patent Right or assist a third party to do so. Duke may terminate the license agreement immediately for our fraud, willful misconduct, or illegal conduct. The license agreement will terminate immediately in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We currently contract with third parties for the manufacturing of our materials for preclinical studies and expect to do so for our planned clinical trials. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our program materials. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. The use of contracted manufacturing and reliance on collaboration partners is relatively cost &#8209;efficient and has eliminated the need for our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional staff early in development. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with manufacturing experience to oversee our contract manufacturers. 

&#160; 

To date, our third &#8209;party manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements. We expect third &#8209;party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our program materials to meet anticipated clinical &#8209;trial scale demands. To meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, third parties with whom we currently work might need to increase their scale of production or we will need to secure alternate suppliers. We believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our clinical and commercial requirements, although we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs. 

&#160; 

Commercialization 

&#160; 

We currently intend to build the commercial infrastructure in the United States and Europe necessary to effectively support the commercialization of all of our programs, if and when we first believe a regulatory approval of a product candidate under one of our programs in a particular geographic market appears probable. The commercial infrastructure for orphan products typically consists of a targeted, specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians supported by sales management, medical liaisons, internal sales support, an internal marketing group, and distribution support. 

&#160; 

Additional capabilities important to the orphan marketplace include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies, and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that any product candidate we may develop will be approved. 

&#160; 

Outside of the United States and Europe, where appropriate, we may elect in the future to utilize strategic partners, distributors, or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of our products. In certain instances, we may consider building our own commercial infrastructure. 

&#160; 

As product candidates advance through our pipeline, our commercial plans may change. In particular, some of our research programs target potentially larger indications. Data, the size of the development programs, the size of the target market, the size of a commercial infrastructure, and manufacturing needs may all influence our strategies in the United States, Europe, and the rest of the world. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post &#8209;approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, including biological products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 

&#160; 

Licensure and Regulation of Biologics in the United States 

&#160; 

In the United States, our candidate products would be regulated as biological products, or biologics, under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations and guidances. The failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, including non &#8209;clinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process or post &#8209;approval process, may subject an applicant to delays in the conduct of the study, regulatory review and approval, and/or administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions may include, but are not limited to, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration &#8217; s, or FDA &#8217; s, refusal to allow an applicant to proceed with clinical testing, refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension, or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, adverse publicity, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, and civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA or the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities. 

&#160; 

An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new biologic in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDA &#8217; s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well &#8209;controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency, and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or GCP; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

preparation and submission to the FDA of a Biologic License Application, or BLA, for a biologic product requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications, including submission of detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product in clinical development and proposed labelling; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the product &#8217; s identity, strength, quality, and purity, and, if applicable, the FDA &#8217; s current good tissue practice, or GTP, for the use of human cellular and tissue products; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the non &#8209;clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of clinical data in support of the BLA; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the BLA and licensure of the new biologic product; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

compliance with any post &#8209;approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and any post &#8209;approval studies required by the FDA. 

&#160; 

Preclinical Studies and Investigational New Drug Application 

&#160; 

Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, including a gene therapy product candidate, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate the potential for efficacy and toxicity in animal studies. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the product or conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before the clinical trials can begin. 

&#160; 

As a result, submission of the IND may result in the FDA not allowing the trials to commence or allowing the trial to commence on the terms originally specified by the sponsor in the IND. If the FDA raises concerns or questions either during this initial 30 &#8209;day period, or at any time during the IND process, it may choose to impose a partial or complete clinical hold. This order issued by the FDA would delay either a proposed clinical study or cause suspension of an ongoing study, until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed and the FDA has notified the company that investigations may proceed. This could cause significant delays or difficulties in completing planned clinical studies in a timely manner. 

&#160; 

With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, of the National Institute of Health, or NIH, decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non &#8209;compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. 

&#160; 

Human Clinical Trials in Support of a BLA 

&#160; 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients with the disease to be treated under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator in accordance with GCP requirements. Clinical trials are conducted under study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 

&#160; 

A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of the BLA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with an international guideline for the ethical conduct of clinical research known as the Declaration of Helsinki and/or the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, whichever provides the greater protection to the participants in the clinical trial. 

&#160; 

Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, clinical trial design, patient informed consent, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. The FDA, IRB, or the 

&#160;

clinical trial sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP rules and the requirements for informed consent. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group may recommend continuation of the study as planned, changes in study conduct, or cessation of the study at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. Finally, research activities involving infectious agents, hazardous chemicals, recombinant DNA, and genetically altered organisms and agents may be subject to review and approval of an Institutional Biosafety Committee in accordance with NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules. 

&#160; 

Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may be required after approval. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy, and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well &#8209;controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a biologic; such Phase 3 studies are referred to as &#8220; pivotal. &#8221; 

&#160; 

In some cases, the FDA may approve a BLA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate &#8217; s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post &#8209;approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of biologics approved under accelerated approval regulations. If the FDA approves a product while a company has ongoing clinical trials that were not necessary for approval, a company may be able to use the data from these clinical trials to meet all or part of any Phase 4 clinical trial requirement or to request a change in the product labeling. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products. 

&#160; 

Special Regulations and Guidance Governing Gene Therapy Products 

&#160; 

It is possible that the procedures and standards applied to gene therapy products and cell therapy products may be applied to any CRISPR/Cas9 product candidates we may develop, but that remains uncertain at this point. The FDA has defined a gene therapy product as one that mediates its effects by transcription and/or translation of transferred genetic material and/or by integrating into the host genome and which are administered as nucleic acids, viruses, or genetically engineered microorganisms. The products may be used to modify cells in vivo or transferred to cells ex vivo prior to administration to the recipient. Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within the CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. The CBER works closely with the NIH and the RAC, which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical, and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published 

&#160;

guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing, and control information in gene therapy INDs. 

&#160; 

In addition to the foregoing, products classified as gene therapies are subject to additional regulation. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies. Although the FDA has indicated that these guidance documents are not legally binding, we believe that our compliance with them is likely necessary to gain approval for any product candidate we may develop. The guidance documents provide additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things, the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing, and control information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy &#8209;related delayed adverse events for a 15 &#8209;year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. 

&#160; 

If a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving the NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, a protocol and related documentation must submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA. In addition, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH will convene the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, a federal advisory committee, to discuss protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC &#8217; s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA web site and may be accessed by the public. 

&#160; 

Finally, to facilitate adverse event reporting and dissemination of additional information about gene therapy trials, the FDA and the NIH established the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, or GeMCRIS. Investigators and sponsors of a human gene transfer trials can utilize this web &#8209;based system to report serious adverse events and annual reports. GeMCRIS also allows members of the public to access basic reports about human gene transfer trials registered with the NIH and to search for information such as trial location, the names of investigators conducting trials, and the names of gene transfer products being studied. 

&#160; 

Compliance with cGMP and GTP Requirements 

&#160; 

Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in full compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products like biologics whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. 

&#160; 

For a gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with GTP. These standards are found in FDA regulations and guidances that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. 

&#160; 

Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of products must also register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Any product manufactured by or imported from a facility that has not registered, whether foreign or domestic, is deemed 

&#160;

misbranded under the FDCA. Establishments may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Inspections must follow a &#8220; risk &#8209;based schedule &#8221; that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated. 

&#160; 

Review and Approval of a BLA 

&#160; 

The results of product candidate development, preclinical testing, and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting license to market the product. The BLA must contain extensive manufacturing information and detailed information on the composition of the product and proposed labeling as well as payment of a user fee. 

&#160; 

The FDA has 60 days after submission of the application to conduct an initial review to determine whether it is sufficient to accept for filing based on the agency &#8217; s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in &#8209;depth review of the application. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or the PDUFA, the FDA has ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority review of the application. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs. The review process may often be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or if the applicant otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 

&#160; 

Under the PHSA, the FDA may approve a BLA if it determines that the product is safe, pure, and potent and the facility where the product will be manufactured meets standards designed to ensure that it continues to be safe, pure, and potent. 

&#160; 

On the basis of the FDA &#8217; s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities and any FDA audits of non &#8209;clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. If the application is not approved, the FDA will issue a complete response letter, which will contain the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application, and when possible will outline recommended actions the sponsor might take to obtain approval of the application. Sponsors that receive a complete response letter may submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the issues identified by the FDA. Such resubmissions are classified under PDUFA as either Class 1 or Class 2. The classification of a resubmission is based on the information submitted by an applicant in response to an action letter. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has two months to review a Class 1 resubmission and six months to review a Class 2 resubmission. The FDA will not approve an application until issues identified in the complete response letter have been addressed. 

&#160; 

The FDA may also refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. In particular, the FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates, and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 

&#160; 

If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product. It may also require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may call for post &#8209;approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess the product &#8217; s safety after approval. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, to help 

&#160;

ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post &#8209;market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 

&#160; 

Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations 

&#160; 

The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life &#8209;threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and priority review designation. 

&#160; 

Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life &#8209;threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product &#8217; s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA &#8217; s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 

&#160; 

Second, in 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as &#8220; breakthrough therapies. &#8221; A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life &#8209;threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross &#8209;disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 

&#160; 

Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case &#8209; by &#8209;case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment &#8209;limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA &#8217; s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 

&#160; 

Accelerated Approval Pathway 

&#160; 

The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life &#8209;threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability 

&#160;

or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 

&#160; 

For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product. 

&#160; 

The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. 

&#160; 

The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor &#8217; s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post &#8209;approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product &#8217; s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post &#8209;marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post &#8209;approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post &#8209;approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post &#8209;marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 

&#160; 

Post &#8209;Approval Regulation 

&#160; 

If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post &#8209;approval regulatory requirements as well as any post &#8209;approval requirements that the FDA have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third &#8209;party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements. 

&#160; 

A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official lot release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer &#8217; s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products. 

&#160; 

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved 

&#160;

labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post &#8209;market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

fines, warning letters or holds on post &#8209;approval clinical trials; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 

&#160; 

&#183; 

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

&#160; 

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Pharmaceutical products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off &#8209;label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off &#8209;label uses may be subject to significant liability. 

&#160; 

Orphan Drug Designation 

&#160; 

Orphan drug designation in the United States is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for rare diseases or conditions. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the biologic for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. 

&#160; 

Orphan drug designation qualifies a company for tax credits and market exclusivity for seven years following the date of the product &#8217; s marketing approval if granted by the FDA. An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. A product becomes an orphan when it receives orphan drug designation from the Office of Orphan Products Development, or OOPD, at the FDA based on acceptable confidential requests made under the regulatory provisions. The product must then go through the review and approval process like any other product. 

&#160; 

A sponsor may request orphan drug designation of a previously unapproved product or new orphan indication for an already marketed product. In addition, a sponsor of a product that is otherwise the same product as an already approved orphan drug may seek and obtain orphan drug designation for the subsequent product for the same rare disease or condition if it can present a plausible hypothesis that its product may be clinically superior to the first drug. More than one sponsor may receive orphan drug designation for the same product for the same rare disease or condition, but each sponsor seeking orphan drug designation must file a complete request for designation. 

&#160; 

The period of exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the FDA and applies only to the indication for which the product has been designated. The FDA may approve a second application for the same product for a different use or a second application for a clinically superior version of the product for the same use. The FDA cannot, however, approve the same product made by another manufacturer for the same indication during the market exclusivity period unless it has the consent of the sponsor or the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient quantities. 

&#160; 

Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 

&#160; 

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, a BLA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric 

&#160;

subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA &#8217; s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 

&#160; 

The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 

&#160; 

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non &#8209;patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non &#8209;patent and orphan exclusivity. This six &#8209;month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA &#8217; s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. 

&#160; 

Biosimilars and Exclusivity 

&#160; 

The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law in March 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 or BPCIA. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. To date, one biosimilar product has been approved by the FDA for use in the United States. No interchangeable biosimilars, however, have been approved. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Additional guidances are expected to be finalized by the FDA in the near term. 

&#160; 

Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is &#8220; biosimilar to &#8221; or &#8220; interchangeable with &#8221; a previously approved biological product or &#8220; reference product. &#8221; In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 

&#160; 

Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor &#8217; s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well &#8209;controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed &#8220; interchangeable &#8221; by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Patent Term Restoration and Extension 

&#160; 

A patent claiming a new biologic product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch &#8209;Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one &#8209;half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product &#8217; s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 

&#160; 

FDA Approval of Companion Diagno stics 

&#160; 

In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product &#8217; s labeling. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post &#8209;market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. 

&#160; 

Regulation and Procedures Governing Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union 

&#160; 

In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union, or EU, generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well &#8209;controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the EU. 

&#160; 

Clinical Trial Approval 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of member states. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application, or CTA, must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 

&#160; 

&#160;

In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will become applicable no earlier than May 28, 2016. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation, which will be directly applicable in all member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For instance, the New Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications. 

&#160; 

Marketing Authorization 

&#160; 

To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under the EU regulatory system, an applicant must submit an MAA, either under a centralized procedure administered by the European Medicines Authority, or EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in EU Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure, or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA &#8209;approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product &#8209;specific waiver, class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. 

&#160; 

The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU member states. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. 

&#160; 

Specifically, the grant of marketing authorization in the European Union for products containing viable human tissues or cells such as gene therapy medicinal products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products. Regulation 1394/2007/EC lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision, and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products, and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of their products to EMA which provides an opinion regarding the application for marketing authorization. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by EMA. 

&#160; 

Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the EMA is responsible for conducting an initial assessment of a product. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Data Protection in the European Union 

&#160; 

In the European Union, new chemical entities approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator &#8217; s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for a period of eight years. During the additional two &#8209;year period of market exclusivity, a 

&#160;

generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator &#8217; s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten &#8209;year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 

&#160; 

Periods of Authorization and Renewals 

&#160; 

A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk &#8209;benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To that end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five &#8209;year renewal period. Any authorization that is not followed by the placement of the drug on the EU market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization 

&#160; 

Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product. These include compliance with the EU &#8217; s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post &#8209;authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. In addition, the manufacturing of authorized products, for which a separate manufacturer &#8217; s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the EMA &#8217; s GMP requirements and comparable requirements of other regulatory bodies in the EU, which mandate the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity. Finally, the marketing and promotion of authorized products, including industry &#8209;sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended. 

&#160; 

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 

&#160; 

Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life &#8209;threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life &#8209;threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 

&#160; 

An orphan drug designation provides a number of benefits, including fee reductions, regulatory assistance, and the possibility to apply for a centralized EU marketing authorization. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten &#8209;year period of market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA nor the European Commission or the member states can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a &#8220; similar medicinal product. &#8221; A &#8220; similar medicinal product &#8221; is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may, however, be reduced to six years 

&#160;

if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation because, for example, the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. 

&#160; 

Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement 

&#160; 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may seek regulatory approval by the FDA or other government authorities. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third &#8209;party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use any product candidates we may develop unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of such product candidates. Even if any product candidates we may develop are approved, sales of such product candidates will depend, in part, on the extent to which third &#8209;party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers, and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such product candidates. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third &#8209;party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost &#8209;effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third &#8209;party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 

&#160; 

In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost &#8209;effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third &#8209;party payor not to cover any product candidates we may develop could reduce physician utilization of such product candidates once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor &#8217; s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor &#8217; s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third &#8209;party reimbursement and coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 

&#160; 

The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of pharmaceuticals have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost &#8209;containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost &#8209;containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company &#8217; s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third &#8209;party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 

&#160; 

Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for any product candidates we may develop will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of any product candidates we may develop to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. 

&#160; 

In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost &#8209;effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessments, or HTAs) in order to obtain reimbursement or 

&#160;

pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. E.U. member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic, and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low &#8209;priced and high &#8209;priced member states), can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries. 

&#160; 

Healthcare Law and Regulation 

&#160; 

Healthcare providers and third &#8209;party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third &#8209;party payors, and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti &#8209;kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the U.S. federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious, or fraudulent or knowingly making, using, or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti &#8209;kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non &#8209;governmental third &#8209;party payors, including private insurers. 

&#160; 

Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry &#8217; s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

&#160; 

Healthcare Reform 

&#160; 

A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. 

&#160; 

By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the PPACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the PPACA of importance to our potential product candidates are: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer &#8217; s Medicaid rebate liability; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

expanded manufacturers &#8217; rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of &#8220; average manufacturer price, &#8221; or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for products that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point &#8209;of &#8209;sale &#8209;discount off the negotiated price of applicable products to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers &#8217; outpatient products to be covered under Medicare Part D; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

a new Patient &#8209;Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription products. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. The PPACA provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings; and 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription product spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019. 

&#160; 

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the PPACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation &#8217; s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 

&#160; 

There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal, and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates. 

&#160; 

Additional regulation 

&#160; 

In addition to the foregoing, state, and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling, and disposal of various biologic, chemical, and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in third countries that impose similar obligations. 

&#160;
