Business 

Historical Information

Flowers Foods&#8217; beginning dates back to 1919 when two brothers, William Howard and Joseph Hampton Flowers, opened Flowers Baking Company in Thomasville, GA. In 1968, Flowers Baking Company went public, became Flowers Industries, and began trading over-the-counter stock. Less than a year later, the company listed on the American Stock Exchange. In 1982, Flowers listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FLO. In the mid-1990s, following the acquisitions of Keebler Foods Company, one of the largest cookie and cracker companies in the U.S., and the top-selling Mrs. Smith&#8217;s frozen pie brand, Flowers Industries transformed from a strong regional baker into a national baked foods company. By 1999, the company had $4.2 billion in annual sales and three business units &#8212; Flowers Bakeries, a super-regional fresh baked foods company; Mrs. Smith&#8217;s Bakeries, a national frozen baked foods company; and Keebler Foods, a national cookie and cracker company. In March 2001, Flowers sold its investment in Keebler to the Kellogg Company. The remaining business units &#8212; Flowers Bakeries and Mrs. Smith&#8217;s Bakeries &#8212; were spun off into a new company, Flowers Foods, which was incorporated in Georgia in 2000. In April 2003, Flowers Foods sold its Mrs. Smith&#8217;s frozen dessert business to The Schwan Food Company, retaining its core fresh bakery and frozen bread and roll businesses.

From 2003 through 2015, Flowers Foods executed its growth strategy to reach more of the U.S. population with fresh breads, buns, rolls, and snack cakes through its direct-store-delivery segment. During this time frame, the company&#8217;s geographic market for its fresh bakery products and brands grew from about 38% of the U.S. population to approximately 85%. 

As used herein, references to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; the &#8220;company,&#8221; &#8220;Flowers&#8221; or &#8220;Flowers Foods&#8221; include the historical operating results and activities of the business operations that comprised Flowers Foods, Inc., as of January 2, 2016.

The Company

Flowers Foods currently operates two business segments: a direct-store-delivery segment (&#8220;DSD Segment&#8221;) and a warehouse delivery segment (&#8220;Warehouse Segment&#8221;). The DSD Segment (84% of total sales) operates 39 bakeries that market a wide variety of fresh bakery foods, including fresh breads, buns, rolls, tortillas, and snack cakes. These products are sold through a direct-store-delivery model to retail and foodservice customers in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, New England, Southwest, California and select markets in Nevada, the Midwest and the Pacific Northwest. The Warehouse Segment (16% of total sales) operates 10 bakeries that produce snack cakes, breads and rolls for national retail, foodservice, vending, and co-pack customers, which are delivered through customers&#8217; warehouse channels and one bakery mix plant.

At the end of fiscal 2015, the DSD Segment&#8217;s fresh bakery foods were available to approximately 85% of the U.S. population. Our DSD Segment is comprised of approximately 5,100 independent distributors who own the rights to distribute certain brands of our fresh packaged bakery foods in their geographic markets. The company has approximately 600 company-owned territories with the distribution rights for those territories available for sale and an additional 230 company owned and operated territories with the distribution rights that are not available for sale.

The Warehouse Segment&#8217;s fresh snack cakes and frozen breads and rolls are sold nationally direct to customers&#8217; warehouses and delivered through frozen and non-frozen contract carriers.

See Note 22, Segment Reporting , of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for financial information about our segments.

&#160;

Our brands are among the best known in the baking industry . Many of our DSD Segment brands have a major presence in the product categories in which they compete. They have a leading share of fresh packaged branded sales measured in both dollars and units in the major metropolitan areas we serve in Southern market s.

Strategies

Flowers Foods has focused on developing and refining operating strategies to create competitive advantages in the marketplace. We believe these strategies help us achieve our long-term objectives and work to build value for shareholders. Put simply, our strategies are to:

&#160;

&#183; 

Grow Sales . We develop new and core markets through new customers, new products, strong brands, and acquisitions. We have a three-pronged strategy for growing sales through acquisitions, market expansions, and core markets. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Invest Wisely . We use technology and efficiencies to be the low-cost producer of delicious bakery foods. We invest to improve the effectiveness of our bakeries, distribution networks, and information systems. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Bake Smart . We innovate to improve processes, enhance quality, reduce costs, and conserve resources. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Give Extraordinary Service . We go beyond the expected to meet our customers&#8217; needs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Appreciate the Team . We respect every individual, embrace diversity, and promote the career growth of team members. 

Grow Sales

As a leading U.S. baker, our products are available to consumers through traditional supermarkets, foodservice distributors, convenience stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, wholesalers, casual dining and quick-serve restaurants, schools, hospitals, dollar stores, and vending machines. To enhance our ability to grow sales, we develop bakery products that are responsive to changing consumer needs and preferences using market research and the strength of our well-established brands. We establish and strengthen our brands in existing and new markets by focusing on product quality, offering a broad and diverse product line, and providing exceptional customer service. We expand our geographic reach by making strategic acquisitions and expanding from our existing bakeries into new markets. We believe our growth strategy has proven successful, evidenced by our sales and net income compound average annual growth rate of 8.1% and 6.7%, respectively, over the last five years. Our strategy encompasses specific efforts for growth through acquisitions, market expansions, and core markets.

Acquisitions

Growth through acquisitions has been an important component of our strategy. Since our initial public offering in 1968, we have made over 100 acquisitions. Over the last ten years we have completed fourteen acquisitions that, at the time of each acquisition, added approximately $2.0 billion in annual revenue in the aggregate. Other than the Sara Lee California and the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets acquisitions discussed below, our primary acquisition targets have historically been independent/regional baking companies in areas of the country where we have not previously had access to market our fresh baked foods. See Note 8, Acquisitions , of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for more details of each of the acquisitions described below.

Alpine Valley Bread acquisition (2015)

On October 13, 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Alpine Valley Bread Company (&#8220;Alpine&#8221;), a family-owned producer of certified organic and all natural breads in the U.S. The acquisition is intended to expand our penetration into the fast growing organic market and provide additional organic production capacity.

&#160;

Dave&#8217;s Killer Bread ac quisition (2015) 

On September 12, 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Dave&#8217;s Killer Bread (&#8220;DKB&#8221;), the nation&#8217;s best-selling organic bread. We believe the acquisition of DKB strengthens our position as the second-largest baker in the U.S. by giving us access to the fast growing organic bread category and expanding our geographic reach into the Pacific Northwest.

Modesto, California acquisition (2013)

On July 27, 2013, the company completed the acquisition of a bun line in Modesto, California from ARYZTA that now serves the California market.

Hostess bread assets acquisition (2013)

On July 19, 2013, the company completed the acquisition of certain assets of Hostess Brands, Inc. (&#8220;Hostess&#8221;), which included the Wonder , Nature&#8217;s Pride , Merita , Home Pride , and Butternut bread brands, 20 closed bakeries and 36 depots (the &#8220;Acquired Hostess Bread Assets&#8221;). We began re-introducing the brands associated with the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets to the marketplace near the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2013.

Sara Lee California acquisition (2013) 

On February 23, 2013, the company completed its acquisition of certain assets and trademark licenses from BBU, Inc., a subsidiary of Grupo Bimbo S.A.B. de C.V. (&#8220;BBU&#8221;). The company acquired from BBU in the acquisition: (1) perpetual, exclusive, and royalty-free licenses to the Sara Lee and Earthgrains brands for sliced breads, buns, and rolls in the state of California and (2) a closed bakery in Stockton, California that we have since sold to a third party. In addition, we received a perpetual, exclusive, and royalty-free license to the Earthgrains brand for a broad range of fresh bakery products in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma market area.

Expansion Markets

In 2011, we announced a specific market expansion goal: to serve a geographical area that includes at least 75% of the U.S. population by 2016 with DSD distribution. At the end of 2015, we had expanded our population reach to approximately 85%, adding an additional 16 states for a total of 41. We exceeded our goal by expanding the reach of our existing bakeries into new territories and acquiring independent bakers in strategic locations.

Our market expansion efforts are driven by our individual bakeries as they extend their service boundaries by serving new customers in markets adjacent to their current service areas. They accomplish this by partnering with retail and foodservice customers to serve new locations, adding our direct-store-delivery model, and working to reach new customers in the targeted growth area.

Core Markets

Our strategy for growth in core markets includes introducing new products to serve both retail and foodservice customers. We have been successful in developing innovative products that gained consumer acceptance. A list of new products introduced in fiscal 2015 can be found below in the Brands &#38; Products discussion.

In core markets, we also strive to enhance our customer base by reaching out to retailers or foodservice customers to offer additional products to those we currently serve and develop relationships with those who are potential customers.

Invest Wisely and Bake Smart

Throughout our history, we have devoted significant resources to automate our production facilities and improve our distribution capabilities. We believe these investments have made us one of the most efficient producers of packaged bakery products in the United States. We believe our capital investments yield valuable long-term benefits, such as more consistent product quality, highly sanitary processes, and greater production volume at a lower cost per unit.

From 2010 through 2015, we invested $420.2 million in capital projects. We believe this consistent, yearly investment in our bakeries has given us a competitive edge in the industry and we are committed to maintaining that advantage by continuing our investments in new technology and improved processes.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we opened the bread line at our Lenexa bakery which was acquired as part of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets in July 2013. We opened the bun line during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The bakery produces products for the Kansas, eastern Oklahoma, Missouri, and Nebraska markets under the Nature&#8217;s Own , Wonder , and Home Pride 

&#160;

brands. During fiscal 2015, we closed a DSD Segment production facility located in Morristown, Tennessee and relocated the production to on e of our other DSD Segment bakeries located in Knoxville, Tennessee. The purpose was to take advantage of more efficient production capacity available at the Knoxville, Tennessee bakery. 

On July 27, 2013, we completed the acquisition of a bun line in Modesto, California that now serves the California market. Also in 2013, we announced that we began production at our Henderson, Nevada bakery, which was acquired as a part of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets. This bakery produces products for markets in southern Nevada and parts of California.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we opened our Knoxville, Tennessee bakery that was acquired as a part of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets. This bakery operates bread and bun lines and increased our production capacity for markets in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio. We also opened a bun line at the Henderson, Nevada bakery and added a bread line to the Modesto, California bakery during fiscal 2014. These bakeries increased our production capacity for the California and Nevada markets.

Through several decades, we have established a reciprocal baking system that allows us to move or shift production among our DSD Segment bakeries to ensure that we are able to meet current market needs, respond to extraordinary events (such as hurricanes or other natural disasters), and remain a low-cost producer and marketer of a full line of bakery products on a national and super-regional basis. We also use company-owned and leased warehouses and distribution centers located in geographic areas that allow for efficient movement of our products from bakery to market.

We believe our company also invests wisely and bakes smart by:

&#160;

&#183; 

Engaging in research and development activities that involve developing new products, improving the quality of existing products, and improving and automating production processes. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Developing and evaluating new processing techniques for both current and proposed product lines. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Improving our shipping and logistics. In fiscal 2009, we began to roll out a paperless, user-directed automated shipping system at our bakeries that uses barcode labels, displays, and door scanners. The system streamlines the finished goods product flow, provides for greater accountability of finished goods received and shipped, improves order fulfillment, and minimizes shortage costs. At the end of fiscal 2015, we had installed this automated shipping system in 36 of our bakeries. We intend to install this system in six to eight additional locations during fiscal 2016. 

Give Extraordinary Service

When it comes to our customers, our strategy is to go beyond the expected. We know that great service helps build strong relationships with our retail and foodservice customers. Our reputation for excellent service supports our sales growth in core markets and helps us as we move into new markets.

Appreciate the Team

We strive to maintain good relationships and ongoing communications with all of our team members. We are committed to equal employment opportunities, meeting all federal and state employment laws, and striving to respect the dignity of all of our team members and associates. In addition, our subsidiaries provide:

&#160;

&#183; 

Fair and equitable compensation and a balanced program of benefits; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Working conditions that promote employees&#8217; health and safety; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Training opportunities that encourage professional development; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Ways for team members to discuss concerns through our open door policy and peer review program. 

We employ approximately 10,900 people. Approximately 1,150 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.

Brands &#38; Products

Nature&#8217;s Own, including Whitewheat, is the best-selling loaf bread in the U.S., and its compound annual growth rate in retail sales since 2000 has been 10.1%. The Nature&#8217;s Own sales, at retail, were $1.1 billion for fiscal 2015. 

&#160;

Our DSD Segment brand activities during fiscal 2015 include the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Nature&#8217;s Own Honey Wheat is the number one selling Fresh Packaged Bread uniform parcel code (&#8220;UPC&#8221;) in the U.S. Nature&#8217;s Own had three of the top five UPC&#8217;s in the Fresh Packaged Bread category during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 (source: IRI Total US MultiOutlet ). 

&#160;

&#183; 

Wonder brand Classic White Loaf returned to the market in 2013, and is continuing to be introduced into new markets in fiscal 2016, gaining the #1 selling branded White Loaf in six U.S. markets: Boston, MA, Hartford, CT/Springfield, MA, Kansas City, KS, Memphis, TN, New York, NY, and Providence, RI (source: IRI Total US MultiOutlet ). 

&#160;

&#183; 

Home Pride brand Wheat Loaf returned to the market in 2013, and is continuing to be introduced into new markets in fiscal 2016, to become the #1 selling branded Soft Variety Loaf in four U.S. markets: Las Vegas, NV, Los Angeles, CA, Sacramento, CA and San Francisco/Oakland, CA (source: IRI Total US MultiOutlet ). 

&#160;

&#183; 

We launched Cobblestone Bread Co. (&#8220; CBC &#8221;) brand of premium specialty bread, buns and rolls in 2014. CBC gets its inspiration from the restaurant and sandwich shop industry. CBC grew to $97.7 million in sales, at retail, for fiscal 2015 (source: IRI Total US MultiOutlet ). 

&#160;

&#183; 

We acquired DKB, the largest organic bread brand in North America, in September 2015. Its products have no artificial ingredients and are certified USDA organic, Non-GMO Project verified and are rich with protein, fiber and whole grains, and are seeded all the way around and through. DKB products are distributed in our DSD Segment. This acquisition adds a new category, products, and customers. We intend to expand our geographic reach into the Pacific Northwest as we implement our strategy. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We acquired Alpine, a U.S. family-owned producer of certified organic all natural breads, in October 2015. This acquisition provides an organic brand for distribution in our Warehouse Segment. In addition, we will utilize excess production capacity to produce organic all natural breads for western markets. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Tastykake brought a variety of new products to the market in fiscal 2015, including four flavors of Danish, Multi Pack Honey Buns, and three flavors of Mini Cupcakes which give consumers a delicious, portable and sharable new treat. New this year, the brand also introduced a seasonal calendar which included seasonal inspired flavors of Mini Donuts and Kandy Kakes. Flavors included Salted Caramel, Red Velvet, Blueberry, Orange Cr&#232;me, Key Lime, Caramel Apple, Pumpkin Spice, Karrot Kake and Gingerbread. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Seasonal products received several national features. The most notable features and awards include: (1) the featuring of Caramel Apple Mini Donuts, Salted Caramel Kandy Kakes and Gingerbread Kandy Kakes on delish.com&#8217;s seasonal round ups, (2) a digital feature for fall mini donuts on Women's Day Magazine Instagram, and (3) best new product award for Salted Caramel Minis donuts by Progressive Grocer Editors. 

Our Warehouse Segment markets a line of organic and specialty breads and rolls under the Alpine Valley Bread , European Bakers brand and proprietary breads, buns, and rolls for specific foodservice customers. This segment&#8217;s snack cakes are sold under the Mrs. Freshley&#8217;s , Broad Street Bakery , and store brands. Our Warehouse Segment products are distributed nationally through retail, foodservice and vending customer warehouses.

In fiscal 2015, we had the following initiatives for the Mrs. Freshley&#8217;s brand:

Mrs. Freshley&#8217;s brought several innovative new products to market. These new product introductions included Red Velvet Cupcakes, Cinnamon Twirls and Cinnamon Mini Donuts both made with Cinnabon Cinnamon Vanilla and Chocolate Icers (iced cr&#232;me filled layer cakes). 

Marketing

We support our key brands with a multi-million dollar advertising and marketing effort that reaches out to consumers through electronic and in-store coupons, social media (such as Facebook and Twitter), digital media (including e-newsletters to consumers), websites (our brand sites and third-party sites), event and sports marketing, on-package promotional offers and sweepstakes, and print advertising. When appropriate, we may join other sponsors with promotional tie-ins. We often focus our marketing efforts on specific products and holidays, such as hamburger and hot dog bun sales during Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and Labor Day.

Customers

Our top 10 customers in fiscal 2015 accounted for 43.5% of sales. During fiscal 2015, our largest customer, Walmart/Sam&#8217;s Club, represented 19.3% of the company&#8217;s sales. The loss of, or a material negative change in our relationship with, Walmart/Sam&#8217;s Club or any other major customer could have a material adverse effect on our business. Walmart was the only customer to account for 10.0% or more of our sales during fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013.

&#160;

Our fresh baked foods customers include mass merchandisers, supermarkets and other retailers, restaurants, quick-serve chains, food wholesalers, institutions, dollar stores, and vending companies. We also sell returned and surplus product through a system of discount bakery stores. The company currently operates 276 such stores, and reported sales of $82.2 million during fiscal 2015 related to these outlets. 

Our Warehouse Segment supplies national and regional restaurants, institutions and foodservice distributors, and retail in-store bakeries with frozen bakery products. It also sells packaged bakery products to wholesale distributors for ultimate sale to a wide variety of food outlets. It sells packaged bakery snack cakes primarily to customers who distribute the product nationwide through multiple channels of distribution, including mass merchandisers, supermarkets, vending outlets and convenience stores. In certain circumstances, we enter into co-packing arrangements with retail customers or other food companies, some of which are competitors.

Distribution

Distributing fresh bakery foods through a direct-store-delivery model is a complex process. It involves determining appropriate order levels and delivering products from bakeries to independent distributors for sale and direct delivery to customer stores. The independent distributors are responsible for ordering products, stocking shelves, maintaining special displays, and visiting customers frequently to ensure adequate inventory and removing unsold goods.

To get fresh bakery foods to market, we use a network of approximately 5,930 territories to distribute Flowers DSD Segment brands in specified geographic markets. The company has sold the majority of the distribution rights for these territories to independent distributors under long-term financing arrangements. The independent distributor model is designed to provide retail and foodservice customers with superior service. Independent distributors, highly motivated by financial incentives from their distribution rights ownership, strive to increase sales by offering outstanding service and merchandising. Independent distributors have the opportunity to benefit directly from the enhanced value of their distribution rights resulting from higher branded sales volume.

The company has developed proprietary software on the hand-held computers that independent distributors use for daily ordering, transactions, and to manage their businesses. The company provides these hand-held computers to the independent distributors and charges them an administrative fee for their use. This fee reduces the company&#8217;s selling, distribution and administrative expenses, and totaled $6.8 million in fiscal 2015, $6.6 million in fiscal 2014, and $5.2 million in fiscal 2013. Our proprietary software permits distributors to track and communicate inventory data to bakeries and to calculate recommended order levels based on historical sales data and recent trends. These orders are electronically transmitted to the appropriate bakery on a nightly basis. This model is designed to provide distributors with an adequate supply of the right mix of products to meet retail and foodservice customers&#8217; immediate needs. We believe this system assists us in minimizing returns of unsold goods.

In addition to hand-held computers, we maintain an information technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) platform that allows us to track sales, product returns, and profitability by selling location, bakery, day, and other criteria. The system provides us with daily real-time, on-line access to sales and gross margin reports, allowing us to make prompt operational adjustments when appropriate. It also permits us to forecast sales and improve our in-store product ordering by customer. This IT platform is integral to our hand-held computers.

We also use scan-based trading technology (referred to as &#8220;pay by scan&#8221; or &#8220;PBS&#8221;) to track and monitor sales and inventories more effectively. PBS allows the independent distributors to bypass the often lengthy product check-in at retail stores, which gives them more time to service customers and merchandise products. PBS also benefits retailers, who only pay suppliers for what they actually sell, or what is scanned at checkout. During fiscal 2015 approximately $1.2 billion of our DSD Segment sales came through our PBS system.

Our Warehouse Segment distributes a portion of our packaged bakery snack products from a central distribution facility located near our Crossville, Tennessee snack cake bakery. We believe this centralized distribution method allows us to achieve both production and distribution efficiencies. Our snack cake bakeries operate what we believe are long, efficient production runs of a single product, which are then shipped to the central distribution facility. Products coming from different bakeries are then cross-docked and shipped directly to customers&#8217; warehouses nationwide. Our frozen bread and roll products are shipped to various outside freezer facilities for distribution to our customers.

Intellectual Property

We own a number of trademarks, trade names, patents, and licenses. The company also sells products under franchised and licensed trademarks and trade names that it does not own. We consider all of our trademarks and trade names important to our business since we use them to build strong brand awareness and consumer loyalty.

&#160;

Raw Materials 

Our primary baking ingredients are flour, sweeteners, shortening, and water. We also use paper products, such as corrugated cardboard, films and plastics to package our bakery foods. We strive to maintain diversified sources for all of our baking ingredients and packaging products. In addition, we are dependent on natural gas or propane as fuel for firing our ovens. 

Commodities, such as our baking ingredients, periodically experience price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments in an effort to manage the impact of such volatility in raw material prices, but some organic ingredients do not offer the same hedging opportunities to reduce the impact of price volatility. Any decrease in the supply available under these agreements and instruments could increase the effective price of these raw materials to us and significantly impact our earnings.

Regulations

As a producer and marketer of food items, our operations are subject to regulation by various federal governmental agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Labor. We also are subject to the regulations of various state agencies, with respect to production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, labor, and local regulations regarding the licensing of bakeries and the enforcement of state standards and facility inspections. Under various statutes and regulations, these federal and state agencies prescribe requirements and establish standards for quality, purity, and labeling. Failure to comply with one or more regulatory requirements could result in a variety of sanctions, including monetary fines or compulsory withdrawal of products from store shelves.

Advertising of our businesses is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, and we are subject to certain health and safety regulations, including those issued under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

The cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the company&#8217;s business. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.

Our operations, like those of similar businesses, are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters, including air and water quality and underground fuel storage tanks, as well as other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. The company is not a party to any material proceedings arising under these regulations. We believe compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will not materially affect the Consolidated Financial Statements or the competitive position of the company. The company is currently in substantial compliance with all material environmental regulations affecting the company and its properties.

Competitive Overview

The U.S. market for fresh and frozen bakery products is estimated at $35 billion at retail. This category is intensely competitive and underwent significant change in 2013. From a national standpoint, Flowers Foods is currently the number two company in the U.S. fresh baking industry based on market share.

In January 2012, Hostess filed for bankruptcy. By November 2012, Hostess, which had been in bankruptcy for six of the last nine years, ceased production and announced it would liquidate. This event impacted the industry as Hostess sales shifted to other producers to meet marketplace needs. These producers included Flowers, BBU (with Sara Lee , Arnolds, Thomas , and Entenmann&#8217;s brands), Campbell Soup Company (with the Pepperidge Farm brand), McKee Foods Corporation ( Little Debbie ) and smaller regional bakeries, retailer-owned bakeries, and store brands. The Hostess cake products were re-introduced into the market in July 2013 by a new and separate company formed by Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulous &#38; Co.

The current competitive landscape for breads and rolls in the U.S. baking industry now consists of BBU, Flowers Foods, and Campbell Soup Company on a national or super-regional scale, together with independent regional bakers, local bakeries, and retailer-owned bakeries. The company faces significant competition from store brands (also known as &#8220;private label&#8221;) and products produced by independent bakers. While store brand breads and rolls have been offered by food retailers for decades, food retailers have put more emphasis on store brand products with the entry of mass merchandisers like Walmart and the ongoing consolidation of traditional supermarkets into much larger regional operations. In general, the store brand share of retail fresh packaged bread accounts for approximately 26% of the dollar sales and approximately 39% of unit sales and has remained stable for the past five years.

&#160;

There are a number of smaller regional bakers in the U.S. Some of these do not enjoy the competitive advantages of larger oper ations, including greater brand awareness and economies of scale in purchasing, distribution, production, information technology, advertising and marketing. However, size alone is not sufficient to ensure success in our industry. 

Competition in the baking industry continues to be driven by a number of factors. These include the ability to serve consolidated retail and foodservice customers, generational changes in family-owned businesses, and competitors&#8217; promotional efforts on branded bread and store brands. Competition typically is based on product availability, product quality, brand loyalty, price, effective promotions, and the ability to target changing consumer preferences. Customer service, including frequent delivery to keep store shelves well-stocked, is an increasingly important competitive factor.

Competition for fresh packaged bakery snack products is based upon the ability to meet production and distribution demands of retail and vending customers at a competitive price. Primary national competitors for fresh packaged bakery snack products include Hostess cake products, McKee Foods Corporation ( Little Debbie and Drake&#8217;s ), ARYZTA ( Cloverhill Bakery ), and BBU.

Competitors for frozen bakery products include Alpha Baking Co., Inc., Rotella&#8217;s Italian Bakery, Highland Baking Company, United States Bakery, Turano Baking Company, and All Round Foods, Inc. Competition for frozen bakery products is based primarily on product quality and consistency, product variety and the ability to consistently meet production and distribution demands at a competitive price.

The company also faces competition from store brands that are produced both by us and our competitors. For several decades, store brand breads and rolls have been offered by food retail customers. Recently, food retailers have put more emphasis on store brand products, initiating a store brand push in such categories as chips and cereals. In general, the store brand share of the fresh bread aisle has remained relatively consistent.
