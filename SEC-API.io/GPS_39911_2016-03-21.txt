 Item 1. Business. 

General 

The Gap, Inc. (Gap Inc., the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of California in July 1969 and was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in May 1988. 

Gap Inc. is a leading global apparel retail company. We offer apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, and children under the Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Athleta, and Intermix brands. Our portfolio of distinct brands across multiple channels and geographies gives us a competitive advantage in the global retail marketplace. 

Gap Inc. has Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, Italy, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and beginning in October 2015, Mexico. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy stores throughout Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. Our products are also available to customers online through Company-owned websites and through the use of third parties that provide logistics and fulfillment services. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties, especially at our Intermix brand. 

In addition to operating in the specialty, outlet, online, and franchise channels, Gap Inc. is a leader among apparel retailers in using omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores, creating world-class shopping experiences regardless of where or how customers shop. The Company's suite of omni-channel services, including order-in-store, reserve-in-store, find-in-store, and ship-from-store, as well as enhanced mobile experiences, are uniquely tailored across its portfolio of brands. 

Gap. Gap is one of the world's most iconic apparel and accessories brands anchored in optimistic, casual, American style. Founded in San Francisco in 1969, our collections continue to build the foundation of modern wardrobes - all things denim, tees, button-downs, and khakis, along with must-have trends. 

Gap is designed to build the foundation of modern wardrobes through every stage of life with apparel and accessories for adult men and women under the Gap name, in addition to GapKids, babyGap, GapMaternity, GapBody, and GapFit collections. Beginning in 1987 with the opening of our first store outside North America in London, Gap continues to connect with customers around the world through specialty stores, online, and franchise stores. In addition, we bring the brand to our value-conscious customers, with exclusively designed collections for Gap Outlet and Gap Factory stores and websites. 

Banana Republic. Acquired with two stores in 1983 as a travel and adventure outfitter, Banana Republic is now a global apparel and accessories brand focused on delivering versatile, contemporary classics, designed for today with style that endures. Banana Republic offers clothing, eyewear, jewelry, shoes, handbags, and fragrances with detailed craftsmanship and luxurious materials. Customers can purchase Banana Republic products globally in our specialty and outlet stores, online, and in franchise stores. 

Old Navy. Old Navy is a global apparel and accessories brand that believes in the democracy of style, making current, on-trend American essentials accessible to every family. Old Navy opened its first store in 1994 in the United States, and expanded globally in 2012 with its first store outside North America in Japan. Since then, Old Navy has continued to expand its global presence, with its first Company-operated stores in China and franchise stores in the Philippines in 2014. Customers can purchase Old Navy products globally in stores, online, and in franchise stores. 

Athleta. Acquired in September 2008, Athleta is Gap Inc.&#8217;s premier fitness and lifestyle brand in the rapidly growing women's active apparel market. Athleta creates versatile and fashionable performance and lifestyle apparel for the fitness-minded woman who lives life on the go. Athleta offers apparel and gear for a range of activities from yoga to strength training and running, as well as seasonal sports, including skiing and tennis. Customers can purchase Athleta products in stores, online, and through its catalogs. 

Intermix. &#32;&#32;Acquired in December 2012, Intermix curates must-have styles from the most coveted emerging and established designers. Known for styling on-trend pieces in unexpected ways, Intermix delivers a unique point of view and an individualized approach to shopping and personal style. Customers can shop in stores in the United States and Canada, and online. 

Piperlime. Launched in 2006, Piperlime offered a mix of private label and branded apparel and accessories. As previously announced in January 2015, the Company closed the Piperlime brand during the first half of fiscal 2015, including the Piperlime e-commerce site, social channels, and one store in New York City. 

All sales to customers are tendered for cash, debit cards, credit cards, or personal checks. We also issue and redeem gift cards through our brands. Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, and Athleta each have a private label credit card program and a co-branded credit card program through which frequent customers receive benefits. Private label and co-branded credit cards are provided by a third-party financing company. 

The range of merchandise displayed in each store varies depending on the selling season and the size and location of the store. Stores are generally open seven days per week (where permitted by law) and most holidays. 

We ended fiscal 2015 &#32;with 3,721 &#32;Company-operated and franchise store locations. For more information on the number of stores by brand and region, see the table in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 

Certain financial information about international operations is set forth under the heading "Segment Information" in Note 16 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

Merchandise Vendors 

We purchase private label and non-private label merchandise from about 1,000 vendors. Our vendors have factories in about 40 countries. Our two largest vendors each accounted for about 5 percent of the dollar amount of our total fiscal 2015 &#32;purchases. Of our merchandise purchased during fiscal 2015 , approximately 99 percent of purchases, by dollar value, were from factories outside the United States, while the remaining 1 percent of all purchases were from domestic factories. Approximately 24 percent of our fiscal 2015 &#32;purchases, by dollar value, were from factories in China. Product cost increases or events causing disruption of imports from China or other foreign countries, including the imposition of additional import restrictions or vendors potentially failing due to political, financial, or regulatory issues, could have an adverse effect on our operations. Substantially all of our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. Also see the sections entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Our business, including our costs and supply chain, is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing," "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business,&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain&#8221; in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 

Seasonal Business 

Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking during the end-of-year holiday period. 

Brand Building 

Our ability to develop and evolve our existing brands is a key to our success. We believe our distinct brands are among our most important assets. With the exception of Intermix, virtually all aspects of brand development, from product design and distribution to marketing, merchandising and shopping environments, are controlled by Gap Inc. employees. With respect to Intermix, we control all aspects of brand development except for product design related to third-party products. We continue to invest in our business and enhance the customer experience through significant investments in marketing and our omni-channel capabilities, enhancement of our online shopping sites, international expansion, remodeling of existing stores, and investments in our supply chain. 

Trademarks and Service Marks 

Gap, GapKids, babyGap, GapMaternity, GapBody, GapFit, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Athleta, and Intermix trademarks and service marks, and certain other trademarks, have been registered, or are the subject of pending trademark applications, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law. 

Franchising 

We have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy stores in a number of countries throughout Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. For additional information on risks related to our franchise business, see the sections entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Our franchise business is subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands&#8221; in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 

Inventory 

The nature of the retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to peak holiday selling season when we, along with other retailers, generally build up inventory levels. We maintain a large part of our inventory in distribution centers. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes or colors) and we primarily use promotions and markdowns to clear merchandise. Also see the sections entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed&#8221; and "Risk Factors&#8212;If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our gross margins could be adversely affected" in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 

Competitors 

The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with local, national, and global apparel retailers. We are also faced with competition in European, Japanese, Chinese, and Canadian markets from established regional and national chains, and our franchisees face significant competition in the markets in which they operate. Also see the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Our business is highly competitive&#8221; in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 

Employees 

As of January 30, 2016 , we had a workforce of approximately 141,000 &#32;employees, which includes a combination of part-time and full-time employees. We also hire seasonal employees, primarily during the peak end-of-year holiday period. 

To remain competitive in the apparel retail industry, we must attract, develop, and retain skilled employees in our design, merchandising, marketing, and other functions. Competition for such personnel is intense. Our success is dependent to a significant degree on the continued contributions of key employees. Also see the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;The failure to attract and retain key personnel, or effectively manage succession, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations&#8221; in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
