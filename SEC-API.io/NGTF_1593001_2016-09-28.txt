 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

NightFood Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; &#8220;the Company&#8221; or &#8220;NightFood&#8221;) is a Nevada corporation organized on October 16, 2013 to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of NightFood, Inc., a New York corporation (the &#8220;Subsidiary&#8221;) from its sole shareholder, Sean Folkson. All of our operations are conducted by the Subsidiary. We are in the business of manufacturing, marketing and distributing snacks specially formulated and promoted for evening consumption. A large number of Americans consume nighttime snacks that are high in sugar, fat, and calories; such snacks can impair sleep and also impair health in general. Management believes that our products are unique in the food industry and that there is a substantial market for our products. We are in the process of establishing distribution channels for these products. Our corporate address is 520 White Plains Road &#8211; Suite 500, Tarrytown, New York 10591 and our telephone number is 888-888-6444. We maintain a web site at www.nightfood.com. Any information that may appear on our web site should not be deemed to be a part of this report. 

&#160; 

Industry Overview 

&#160; 

We are an early-stage company that is seeking to establish a market within the snack industry by offering a line of snack foods that are appropriate for evening consumption. Based on available figures for 2013 published by SymphonyIRI Group, American consumers spend over $50 Billion annually on snacks consumed at night, and this figure continues to grow. A majority of adults are trying to eat foods and snacks that they understand will prevent or manage health problems and 37% of consumers are willing to pay more for foods with perceived health benefits. Moreover, industry data indicates that the most popular nighttime snack choices include products and categories that are traditionally considered high in calories, and &#8220;unhealthy&#8221; options, such as cookies, salty snacks (chips, pretzels, and popcorn), ice cream, and candy. 

&#160; 

Our Products, Present and Proposed 

&#160; 

Our initial product is the NightFood nutrition bar. NightFood nutrition bars are made from commercially available ingredients and a proprietary combination of other components in a proprietary process. During the course of fiscal 2016, the Company modified its packaging, positioning, and branding, including switching from a 6 count retail pack to a 12 count pack for the bars. The packages are typically merchandised both open and closed, so the consumer can purchase an individual bar, or an entire box of bars.. NightFood&#174; is the first product positioned as a healthier and better alternative to other convenient nighttime snack options. Compared to the existing popular options, each 140 calorie NightFood&#174; bar is specially formulated to satisfy late-night cravings, tackle nighttime hunger, on fewer calories, and with a healthier, more sleep-friendly nutritional profile. We believe that NightFood&#174; bars are an optimal after-dinner snack in terms of composition and calories. In addition, the bars contain a clinically proven bioactive ingredient called Chocamine&#174;. Chocamine is a patented natural cocoa extract that is believed to promote satiety and craving satisfaction, while also providing the health and relaxation benefits of chocolate without the caffeine, fat, calories, and sugars. In April of 2016, the Company secured exclusive use of Chocamine in any products formulated and marketed for nighttime consumption. 

&#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

Depending upon the success of the NightFood&#174; bar and our available resources, we intend to consider expanding our product line to include formulations with and without sleep aiding bioactive ingredients, nighttime snack products specifically for children, and snacks in different food formats such as cookies, chips, ice cream, etc. 

&#160; 

Production 

&#160; 

We have utilized contract manufacturers for producing our products. These include Noble Foods for product manufacture, Arranti Label and Stuart Packaging for our packaging, and ShipRight Solutions for our warehousing and fulfillment. We consider our relations with each of these suppliers to be good. We also believe that the nature of the market for these services ensures that if we were required to find an alternate supplier for any of these services, we could do so on similar terms. 

&#160; 

Marketing &#38; Distribution 

&#160; 

During FY2016, our new marketing and distribution strategy shifted NightFood products away from the specialty health &#38; nutrition vertical and towards mainstream supermarkets. We believe our most receptive consumer will be one that is wrestling with undesirable night snacking habits. Our updated product packaging merchandises NightFood bars in a novel 12-pack display case featuring the CraveMonster&#8482; design and was approved for distribution by KeHE Distributors LLC in March of 2016. 

&#160; 

Through our relationship with KeHE, NightFood is now available in the Market Street supermarket chain in Texas, a division of Albertsons. With well over 2,000 locations, Albertsons is the 2 nd largest supermarket retailer in the country. The Company is in discussions to introduce NightFood products onto the shelves of other large supermarket chains though KeHE, once properly capitalized. 

&#160; 

NightFood is also available in the Fairway supermarket chain in Metro New York City, as well as some other independent retailers in and around New York. Additional funds are needed to support sales at Fairway and maintain sales volume after an initial introductory push, bolstered by in-store product sampling and demonstrations. 

&#160; 

Due to market dynamics and distribution channels, Fairway retails each NightFood bar for $2.50, whereas Market Street retails each NightFood bar at $1.79. 

&#160; 

NightFood bars may also still be found in some GNC locations around the country, however we did not receive any orders from them during fiscal 2016 despite reports from GNC of increasing sales in FY2016 compared to FY2015. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The nutritional/snack food business is highly competitive and includes such participants as large companies like Mondelez, Nestle S.A. and Quaker Oats and more specialized companies such as Cliff Bar, Quest Nutrition and many smaller companies. Many of these competitors have well established names and products. Management is not aware of any competitor offering snacks targeting the nighttime snack occasion, or formulated to satisfy unhealthy nighttime cravings in a sleep-friendly way. We will initially compete based upon the unique nature of our product. However, other companies, including those with greater name recognition than us and greater resources may seek to introduce products that directly compete with our products. Management believes that if a competitor sought to develop a competing product, it could do so and begin to establish retail distribution in 12-24 months. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property Rights 

&#160; 

We own the registered trademark &#8220;NightFood&#174;&#8221; and believe that it will prove important to our business. Additionally we own the domain NightFood.com as well as many other relevant domains such as late-night-snack.com, nighttimesnack.com, and nighttimesnacking.com, as well as NightFood.us, NightFood.net, TryNightFood.com, GetNightFood.com, NiteFood.com, and Night-Food.com. We also own the toll-free number 888-888-NIGHT. We also rely on proprietary information as to our formulas and have non-disclosure agreements with our suppliers.

&#160; 

Personnel 

&#160; 

We currently have no employees except Sean Folkson, our President and CEO, and Peter Leighton, our VP of Marketing who is currently serving the company on a part-time basis. Should we be successful in executing our business plan, we anticipate hiring additional employees in the future to assist with marketing, sales and clerical positions. We rely on consultants and outsourced services to accomplish work that might otherwise be done by employees in a large established company. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

In FY 2016, no individual customer made up more than 15% of our revenues.
