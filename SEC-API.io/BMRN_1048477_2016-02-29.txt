 Item 1. Business 

Overview

BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BioMarin, we, us or our) develops and commercializes innovative pharmaceuticals for serious diseases and medical conditions. We select product candidates for diseases and conditions that represent a significant unmet medical need, have well-understood biology and provide an opportunity to be first-to-market or offer a significant benefit over existing products. Our product portfolio consists of five approved products and multiple clinical and pre-clinical product candidates. Our approved products are Vimizim (elosulfase alpha), Naglazyme (galsulfase), Kuvan (sapropterin dihydrochloride), Aldurazyme (laronidase) and Firdapse (amifampridine phosphate). 

Vimizim received marketing approval in the United States (the U.S.) in February 2014, in the European Union (the EU) in April 2014 and subsequently in other countries. Naglazyme received marketing approval in the U.S. in May 2005, in the EU in January 2006 and subsequently in other countries. Kuvan was granted marketing approval in the U.S. and the EU in December 2007 and December 2008, respectively. Aldurazyme, which was developed in collaboration with Genzyme Corporation (Genzyme), was approved in 2003 for marketing in the U.S. and the EU, and subsequently in other countries. In December 2009, Firdapse received marketing approval in the EU.

We are conducting clinical trials on several investigational product candidates for the treatment of various diseases including: Kyndrisa (drisapersen), an exon-51 skipping compound for the potential treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) amenable to exon 51 skipping; pegvaliase (formerly referred to as PEG PAL), an enzyme substitution therapy for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU); reveglucosidase alfa (formerly referred to as BMN 701), an enzyme replacement therapy for Pompe disease, a glycogen storage disorder; vosoritide (formerly referred to as BMN 111), a peptide therapeutic for the treatment of achondroplasia, the leading cause of dwarfism; BMN 044, BMN 045 and BMN 053 for the treatment of DMD (exons 44, 45 and 53); cerliponase alfa (formerly referred to as BMN 190) for the treatment of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN2), a lysomal storage disorder primarily affecting the brain; and BMN 270, an AAV VIII vector and Factor VIII gene therapy drug development candidate, for the treatment of hemophilia A. We are conducting or planning to conduct preclinical development of several other product candidates for genetic and other metabolic diseases, including a novel fusion of alpha-N-acetyglucosaminidase (NAGLU) with a peptide derived from insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) (formerly referred to as BMN 250), for the treatment of Sanfilippo B syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS IIIB). We expect to initiate a Phase 1 study for NAGLU in the first half of 2016.

Recent Developments 

Regulatory Review of Kyndrisa

In January 2016 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) issued a complete response letter to our New Drug Application (NDA) for Kyndrisa for the treatment of DMD amenable to exon 51 skipping. The FDA issues a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval in its present form. The FDA concluded that the standard of substantial evidence of effectiveness for Kyndrisa had not been met. We are reviewing the complete response letter and will work with the FDA to determine the appropriate next steps regarding this application. A Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Kyndrisa for the treatment of DMD amenable to exon 51 skipping remains under review in the EU. We anticipate that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) will provide an opinion for our MAA for Kyndrisa in the second quarter of 2016. If the CHMP opinion is positive, the MAA will be referred to the European Commission (EC). The EC is expected to render a final decision for Kyndrisa in the second half of 2016. If the MAA is approved by the EC, we would receive marketing authorization for Kyndrisa in the EU. Furthermore, if we receive approval in the EU, we plan to roll out our international registration strategy for Kyndrisa using the EU approval as the basis of multiple international applications. 

Acquisition of Rights to PKU Franchise from Ares Trading S.A. (Merck Serono)

On October 1, 2015 we entered into a Termination and Transition Agreement with Ares Trading S.A. (Merck Serono), as amended and restated on December 23, 2015 (the A&#38;R Kuvan Agreement), to terminate the Development, License and Commercialization Agreement, dated May 13, 2005, as amended (the License Agreement), between us and Merck Serono, including the license to Kuvan granted in the License Agreement from us to Merck Serono. Also on October 1, 2015, we and Merck Serono entered into a Termination Agreement (the Pegvaliase Agreement) to terminate the license to pegvaliase granted in the License Agreement from us to Merck Serono. On January 1, 2016, pursuant to the A&#38;R Kuvan Agreement and the Pegvaliase Agreement, we completed the acquisition from Merck Serono and its affiliates of certain rights and other assets, and the assumption from Merck Serono and its affiliates of certain liabilities, in each case with respect to Kuvan and pegvaliase. As a result, we acquired all global rights to Kuvan and pegvaliase from Merck Serono, with the exception of Kuvan in Japan. Previously, we had exclusive rights to Kuvan in the U.S. and Canada and pegvaliase in the U.S. and Japan.

Pursuant to the A&#38;R Kuvan Agreement, in December 2015 we paid a deposit on this transaction totaling $371.8 million and we may pay Merck Serono up to a maximum of &#8364;60.0 million, in cash, if future sales milestones are met. Pursuant to the Pegvaliase Agreement, we may also pay Merck Serono up to a maximum of &#8364;125.0 million, in cash, if future development milestones are met. 

We and Merck Serono have no further rights or obligations under the License Agreement with respect to pegvaliase. The License Agreement will continue in effect in order to complete the transfer of certain assets related to Kuvan, the majority of which occurred in January 2016. Accordingly, we continue to rely on Merck Serono to provide critical transition services for sales and distribution of Kuvan until marketing authorizations can be transferred in approximately 13 remaining countries, but in no event later than December 31, 2016.

Sale of Talazoparib to Medivation, Inc.

On October 6, 2015 we completed the sale of talazoparib (formerly referred to as BMN 673), an orally available poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor for the treatment of patients with certain cancers, to Medivation, Inc. (Medivation), under which Medivation acquired the worldwide rights to talazoparib in exchange for an upfront payment of $410.0 million and up to an additional $160.0 million upon the achievement of regulatory and sales-based milestones, as well as mid-single digit percentage royalties for talazoparib.

Paragraph IV Notice Letter from Dr. Reddy&#8217;s Laboratories and Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. 

We received a paragraph IV notice letter, dated October 3, 2014, from Dr. Reddy&#8217;s Laboratories, Inc. and Dr. Reddy&#8217;s Laboratories, Ltd. (collectively, DRL), notifying us that DRL had filed an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) seeking approval of a proposed generic version of Kuvan 100 mg oral tablets prior to the expiration of our patents listed in the FDA&#8217;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book). Additionally, we received a paragraph IV notice letter, dated January 22, 2015, from Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Par), notifying us that Par has filed an ANDA seeking approval of a proposed generic version of Kuvan 100 mg oral tablets prior to the expiration of our patents listed in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book. Together with Merck &#38; Cie, on March 6, 2015 we filed lawsuits against both DRL and Par in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging infringement of our patents relating to Kuvan tablets and seeking an injunction to prevent Par from introducing a generic version of Kuvan tablets that would infringe our patents prior to their expiration. The filing of that lawsuit triggered the automatic 30-month stay on the approval of each ANDA in accordance with the Hatch-Waxman Act, which expires in July 2017. In response, DRL and Par alleged, inter alia, that the asserted patents are not infringed and/or are invalid. 

In September 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement with DRL that resolved the patent litigation with DRL in the U.S. related to Kuvan 100 mg oral tablets. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we have granted DRL a non-exclusive license to our Kuvan-related patents to allow DRL to market a generic version of sapropterin dihydrochloride 100 mg tablets in the U.S. for the indications approved for Kuvan beginning at a confidential date in the future, but which is more than five years from the settlement date, or earlier under certain circumstances.

The settlement with DRL does not affect the case against Par, and the litigation against Par is still pending. The parties submitted opening claim construction briefs on January 14, 2016, and responsive claim construction briefs are due on March 4, 2016. The Court has not yet set a date for trial in the litigation against Par. 

We also received a paragraph IV notice letter, dated January 14, 2016, from Par, notifying us that Par has filed a separate ANDA seeking approval of a proposed generic version of Kuvan 100 mg oral powder prior to the expiration of our patents listed in the FDA's Orange Book. On February 22, 2016, we filed a lawsuit against Par in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging infringement of our patents relating to Kuvan powder and seeking an injunction to prevent Par from introducing a generic version of Kuvan powder that would infringe our patents prior to their expiration. The filing of that lawsuit triggered the automatic 30-month stay on the approval of Par&#8217;s ANDA in accordance with the Hatch-Waxman Act, which expires in July 2018.

Acquisiti on of Prosensa Holding N.V. 

On January 29, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Prosensa Holding N.V. (Prosensa), a public limited liability company organized under the laws of the Netherlands, for a total purchase price of $751.5 million. In connection with the acquisition of Prosensa, we recognized transaction costs of $9.7 million, of which $7.0 million and $2.7 million, respectively, was recognized in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Prosensa was an innovative biotechnology company engaged in the discovery and development of ribonucleic acid (RNA)-modulating therapeutics for the treatment of genetic disorders. Prosensa&#8217;s primary focus was on rare neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders with a large unmet medical need, including subsets of patients with DMD, myotonic dystrophy and Huntington&#8217;s disease. Prosensa&#8217;s clinical portfolio of RNA-based product candidates was focused on the treatment of DMD. Each of Prosensa&#8217;s DMD compounds has been granted orphan drug status in the U.S. and the EU, including Prosensa&#8217;s lead product, Kyndrisa.

In connection with our acquisition of Prosensa, we made cash payments totaling $680.1 million, which consisted of $620.7 million for approximately 96.8% of Prosensa&#8217;s ordinary shares (the Prosensa Shares), $38.6 million for the options that vested pursuant to our tender offer for the Prosensa Shares and $20.8 million to the remaining Prosensa shareholders that did not tender their shares under the tender offer. Additionally, for each Prosensa Share, we issued one non-transferable contingent value right (CVR), which represents the contractual right to receive a cash payment of up to $4.14 per Prosensa Share, or an aggregate of approximately $160.0 million (undiscounted), upon the achievement of certain product approval milestones. The fair value of the CVRs and acquired in-process research and development (IPR&#38;D) on the acquisition date was $71.4 million and $772.8 million, respectively. The acquisition date fair value of the CVRs and IPR&#38;D was estimated by applying a probability-based income approach utilizing an appropriate discount rate. Key assumptions include a discount rate and various probability factors. See Note 13 to the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding fair value measurements of the CVRs, which is included in contingent acquisition consideration payable.

Commercial Products 

Vimizim 

Vimizim is an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of MPS IV A, a lysosomal storage disorder. MPS IV A is a disease characterized by deficient activity of Nacetylgalactosamine- 6-sulfatase (GALNS) causing excessive lysosomal storage of glycosaminoglycans such as keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. This excessive storage causes a systemic skeletal dysplasia, short stature, and joint abnormalities, which limit mobility and endurance. Malformation of the chest impairs respiratory function, and looseness of joints in the neck cause spinal instability and potentially spinal cord compression. Other symptoms may include hearing loss, corneal clouding, and heart disease. Initial symptoms often become evident in the first five years of life. The disease substantially limits both the quality and length of life of those affected. We have identified approximately 1,800 patients worldwide suffering from MPS IV A and estimate that the total number of patients suffering from MPS IV A worldwide could be as many as 3,000.

Vimizim was granted marketing approval in the U.S. and the EU in February 2014 and April 2014, respectively, and subsequently in several other countries. We market Vimizim in the U.S., the EU, and other areas using our own existing sales force and commercial organization. Additionally, we use local distributors in several other regions to help us pursue registration and/or market Vimizim on a named patient basis. Vimizim net product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $228.1 million, $77.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively.

Naglazyme 

Naglazyme is a recombinant form of N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase (arylsulfatase B) indicated for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI). MPS VI is a debilitating life-threatening genetic disease for which no other drug treatment currently exists and is caused by the deficiency of arylsulfatase B, an enzyme normally required for the breakdown of certain complex carbohydrates known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Patients with MPS VI typically become progressively worse and experience multiple severe and debilitating symptoms resulting from the build-up of carbohydrate residues in tissues in the body. These symptoms include: inhibited growth, spinal cord compression, enlarged liver and spleen, joint deformities and reduced range of motion, skeletal deformities, impaired cardiovascular function, upper airway obstruction, reduced pulmonary function, frequent ear and lung infections, impaired hearing and vision, sleep apnea, malaise and reduced endurance.

Naglazyme was granted marketing approval in the U.S. in May 2005, in the EU in January 2006, and subsequently in other countries. We market Naglazyme in the U.S., the EU, Canada, Latin America, Turkey and other areas using our own sales force and commercial organization. Additionally, we use local distributors in several other regions to help us pursue registration and/or market Naglazyme on a named patient basis. Naglazyme net product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $303.1 million, $334.4 million and $271.2 million, respectively. 

Kuvan 

Kuvan is a proprietary synthetic oral form of 6R-BH4, a naturally occurring enzyme co-factor for phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), indicated for patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Kuvan is the first drug for the treatment of PKU, which is an inherited metabolic disease that affects at least 50,000 diagnosed patients under the age of 40 in the developed world. We believe that approximately 30% to 50% of those with PKU could benefit from treatment with Kuvan. PKU is caused by a deficiency of activity of an enzyme, PAH, which is required for the metabolism of phenylalanine (Phe). Phe is an essential amino acid found in all protein-containing foods. Without sufficient quantity or activity of PAH, Phe accumulates to abnormally high levels in the blood, resulting in a variety of serious neurological complications, including severe mental retardation and brain damage, mental illness, seizures and other cognitive problems. As a result of newborn screening efforts implemented in the 1960s and early 1970s, virtually all PKU patients under the age of 40 in developed countries have been diagnosed at birth. Currently, PKU can be managed by a Phe-restricted diet, which is supplemented by nutritional replacement products, like formulas and specially manufactured foods; however, it is difficult for most patients to adhere to the strict diet to the extent needed for achieving adequate control of blood Phe levels. Kuvan has been demonstrated to reduce blood Phe levels by 30% in approximately 30% of patients.

In December 2013, the FDA approved the use of Kuvan powder for oral solution that is provided in a dose sachet packet allowing faster dissolution of powder in solution compared to the current tablet form. This new dosage form is expected to have increasing appeal for young patients in the one to seven year age range. We commenced the commercial launch of this new form of Kuvan on February 28, 2014.

Kuvan was granted marketing approval for the treatment of PKU in the U.S. in December 2007 and in the EU in December 2008. Using our own sales force and commercial organization, we market Kuvan in the U.S. and Canada (and effective as of January 1, 2016, in the rest of the world, except for Japan and certain countries in which we have not yet completed the transfer of certain regulatory approvals from Merck Serono, as described below). Kuvan has been granted orphan drug status in the U.S., which confers market exclusivity in the U.S. for the treatment of PKU, which expired in June 2015. In addition, Kuvan has been granted orphan drug status in the EU, which together with pediatric exclusivity, confers 12 years of market exclusivity in the EU that expires in 2020. We expect that our patents will provide market exclusivity beyond the expiration of orphan status. Kuvan net product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $239.3 million, $203.0 million, and $167.4 million, respectively. 

In 2005, we entered into the License Agreement with Merck Serono for the further development and commercialization of Kuvan and any other product containing 6R-BH4, and pegvaliase for PKU. Through the License Agreement, as amended in 2007, Merck Serono acquired exclusive rights to market these products in all territories outside the U.S., Canada and Japan, and we retained exclusive rights to market these products in the U.S. and to market Kuvan in Canada and pegvaliase in Japan. Under the License Agreement, Merck Serono marketed Kuvan in the EU and several other countries outside the U.S., Canada and Japan. Under the License Agreement, we were entitled to receive royalties, on a country-by-country basis, until the later of the expiration of patent rights licensed to Merck Serono or ten years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product in such country. Under this arrangement, we also sold Kuvan to Merck Serono at or near cost, and Merck Serono resold the product to end-users outside the U.S., Canada and Japan. The royalty earned from Kuvan product sold by Merck Serono in the EU is included as a component of net product revenues in the period earned. During 2015, 2014 and 2013 we earned $2.0 million, $2.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, in net royalties on net sales of $56.5 million, $55.5 million and $51.0 million of Kuvan by Merck Serono, respectively. We recorded collaborative agreement revenue associated with shared Kuvan development costs in the amounts of $0.8 million, $0.9 million, and $1.0 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into the A&#38;R Kuvan Agreement to terminate the License Agreement, including the license to Kuvan granted in the License Agreement from us to Merck Serono. Also in the fourth quarter of 2015, we and Merck Serono entered into the Pegvaliase Agreement to terminate the license to pegvaliase granted in the License Agreement from us to Merck Serono. On January 1, 2016, pursuant to the A&#38;R Kuvan Agreement and the Pegvaliase Agreement, we completed the acquisition from Merck Serono and its affiliates of certain rights and other assets, and the assumption from Merck Serono and its affiliates of certain liabilities, in each case with respect to Kuvan and pegvaliase. As a result, we acquired all global rights to Kuvan and pegvaliase from Merck Serono, with the exception of Kuvan in Japan. Previously, we had exclusive rights to Kuvan in the U.S. and Canada and pegvaliase in the U.S. and Japan.

Pursuant to the A&#38;R Kuvan Agreement, in December 2015, we paid a deposit on this transaction totaling $371.8 million and we may pay Merck Serono up to a maximum of &#8364;60.0 million, in cash, if future sales milestones are met. Pursuant to the Pegvaliase Agreement, we may pay Merck Serono up to a maximum of &#8364;125.0 million, in cash, if future development milestones are met. 

We and Merck Serono have no further rights or obligations under the License Agreement with respect to pegvaliase. The License Agreement will continue in effect in order to complete the transfer of certain assets related to Kuvan , the majority of which occurred in January 2016. Accordingly, we continue to rely on Merck Serono to provide critical transition services for sales and distribution of Kuvan until marketing authorizations can be transferred in approximately 13 remaining countries , but in no even t later than December 31, 2016. 

Aldurazyme 

Aldurazyme was approved for marketing in the U.S. in April 2003, in the EU in June 2003 and subsequently in other countries for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I). MPS I is a progressive and debilitating life-threatening genetic disease, for which no other drug treatment currently exists, that is caused by the deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase, a lysosomal enzyme normally required for the breakdown of GAGs. Patients with MPS I typically become progressively worse and experience multiple severe and debilitating symptoms resulting from the build-up of carbohydrate residues in all tissues in the body. These symptoms include: inhibited growth, delayed and regressed mental development (in the severe form of the disease), enlarged liver and spleen, joint deformities and reduced range of motion, impaired cardiovascular function, upper airway obstruction, reduced pulmonary function, frequent ear and lung infections, impaired hearing and vision, sleep apnea, malaise and reduced endurance.

We developed Aldurazyme through collaboration with Genzyme, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanofi. Under our collaboration agreement with Genzyme, we are responsible for manufacturing Aldurazyme and supplying it to Genzyme. Genzyme records sales of Aldurazyme and is required to pay us, on a quarterly basis, a 39.5% to 50% royalty on worldwide net product sales, depending on sales volume. We recognize a portion of this royalty as product transfer revenue when product is released to Genzyme and all of our obligations have been fulfilled. Genzyme&#8217;s return rights for Aldurazyme are limited to defective product. The product transfer revenue represents the fixed amount per unit of Aldurazyme that Genzyme is required to pay us if the product is unsold by Genzyme. The amount of product transfer revenue will eventually be deducted from the calculated royalty when the product is sold by Genzyme. Additionally, Genzyme and we are members of BioMarin/Genzyme LLC, a 50/50 limited liability company (the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC) that: (1) holds the intellectual property relating to Aldurazyme and other collaboration products and licenses all such intellectual property on a royalty-free basis to us and Genzyme to allow us to exercise our rights and perform our obligations under the agreements related to the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC, and (2) engages in research and development activities that are mutually selected and funded by Genzyme and us.

Aldurazyme net product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $98.0 million, $105.6 million and $83.6 million, respectively. The net product revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 include $95.8 million, $97.0 million and $88.5 million, respectively, of royalty revenue on net Aldurazyme sales by Genzyme. Net sales of Aldurazyme by Genzyme totaled $217.8 million, $228.8 million and $212.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Aldurazyme net product revenues included incremental Aldurazyme net product transfer revenue of $2.2 million and $8.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and previously recognized product transfer revenue of $4.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. Incremental product transfer revenue that we previously recognized reflects incremental shipments of Aldurazyme to Genzyme to meet future product demand. In the future, to the extent that Genzyme Aldurazyme inventory quantities on hand remain consistent, we expect that our total Aldurazyme revenues will approximate the 39.5% to 50% royalties on net product sales by Genzyme.

Firdapse 

Firdapse is a form of 3,4-diaminopyridine (amifampridine phosphate or 3,4-DAP) for the treatment of Lambert Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS). Firdapse was originally developed by AGEPS, the pharmaceutical unit of the Paris Public Hospital Authority. Firdapse was granted marketing approval in the EU in December 2009. In addition, Firdapse has been granted orphan drug status in the EU, which confers ten years of market exclusivity in the EU. We launched Firdapse on a country-by-country basis in Europe in 2010. Firdapse net product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $16.0 million, $18.1 million and $16.1 million, respectively. In October 2012, we licensed to Catalyst Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc. (Catalyst) the North American rights to develop and market Firdapse. In exchange for the North American rights to Firdapse, we may receive royalties of 7% to 10% on net product sales of Firdapse in North America. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we recognized collaborative revenue of $0.3 million, $0.7 million and $2.9 million, respectively, related to our agreement with Catalyst. 

LEMS is a rare autoimmune disease with the primary symptoms of muscle weakness. Muscle weakness in LEMS is caused by autoantibodies to voltage gated calcium channels leading to a reduction in the amount of acetylcholine released from nerve terminals. The prevalence of LEMS is estimated at four to ten per million, or approximately 2,000 to 5,000 patients in the EU and 1,200 to 3,100 patients in the U.S. Approximately 50% of LEMS patients diagnosed have small cell lung cancer. Patients with LEMS typically present with fatigue, muscle pain and stiffness. The weakness is generally more marked in the proximal muscles particularly of the legs and trunk. Other problems include reduced reflexes, drooping of the eyelids, facial weakness and problems with swallowing. Patients often report a dry mouth, impotence, constipation and feelings of light headedness on standing. On occasion, these problems 

can be life threatening when the weakness involves respiratory muscles. A diagnosis of LEMS is generally made on the basis of clinical symptoms, electromyography testing and the presence of auto antibodies against voltage gated calcium channels. Currently approved treatments of LEMS can consist of strategies directed at the underlying malignancy, if one is present. Therapy of small cell lung cancer is limited and outcomes are generally poor. Immunosuppressive agents have been tried but success is limited by toxicity and difficulty administering the regimens. A mainstay of therapy has been 3, 4-DAP, but its use in practice has been limited by the drug&#8217;s availability . 

Products in Clinical Development 

Kyndrisa

We acquired Kyndrisa, Prosensa&#8217;s lead candidate for a subset of DMD amenable to exon 51 skipping, on January 15, 2015. DMD is a rare genetic disease, affecting approximately 1 in 3,500 boys globally, and is invariably fatal. There is currently no approved disease-modifying therapy for DMD. The progressive muscle-wasting that characterizes DMD is caused by inadequate production of dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscle function, as a result of mutations in the dystrophin gene. The different mutations, which are mostly deletions of one or more exons found in the dystrophin gene, result in distinct sub-populations of DMD patients. Kyndrisa aims to address a specific mutation in the dystrophin gene that represents approximately 13% of all DMD patients, or approximately 10,000 patients worldwide. 

Two of the Phase 2 trials of Kyndrisa investigated change in a six minute walk test (6MWT) as compared to a placebo. The first Phase 2 trial showed a mean 32-meter improvement for the Kyndrisa group compared to a 4-meter decline in the placebo group (p=0.014). The second Phase 2 trial showed a mean 16-meter improvement for the Kyndrisa group compared to a mean 11-meter decline in the placebo group (p=0.069). When the results of these trials were combined in a post hoc analysis, the trials showed a mean 20-meter improvement for the combined Kyndrisa group compared to a mean 11-meter decline in the placebo group (p=.003). In the Phase 3 trial, the Kyndrisa group experienced a mean 43-meter decline compared to a mean 53-meter decline in the placebo group, although the result did not reach statistical significance (p=0.415). In the open label extension study of 12 patients, which included patients who lost ambulation, patients receiving 6 mg/kg of Kyndrisa experienced a mean 25-meter decline on the 6MWT at 177 weeks as compared to an expected 115-meter decline at 156 weeks, based on the natural history database.

Based on this data and the results of the clinical trials, in June 2014, Prosensa announced that it would pursue an NDA filing for Kyndrisa with the FDA under an accelerated approval pathway based on existing data and in October 2014 Prosensa submitted the first module for an NDA regulatory filing for Kyndrisa to the FDA. Kyndrisa was granted Fast Track status and breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA, making it eligible for a rolling review of the NDA. Breakthrough therapy designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy. In the second quarter of 2015 we completed the submission of the NDA to the FDA for Kyndrisa and an MAA with the EMA for Kyndrisa .

In January 2016, the FDA issued a complete response letter to our NDA for Kyndrisa for the treatment of DMD amenable to exon 51 skipping. The FDA issues a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval in its present form. The FDA concluded that the standard of substantial evidence of effectiveness for Kyndrisa had not been met. We are reviewing the complete response Letter and will work with the FDA to determine the appropriate next steps regarding this application. An MAA for Kyndrisa for the treatment of DMD amenable to exon 51 skipping remains under review in the EU. We anticipate that the CHMP of the EMA will provide an opinion for our MAA for Kyndrisa in the second quarter of 2016. If the CHMP opinion is positive, the MAA will be referred to the EC. The EC is expected to render a final decision for Kyndrisa in the second half of 2016. If the MAA is approved by the EC, we would receive marketing authorization for Kyndrisa in all EU Member States. Furthermore, if we receive approval in the EU, we plan to roll out our international registration strategy for Kyndrisa using the EU approval as the basis of multiple international applications.

Pegvaliase 

Pegvaliase is an investigational enzyme substitution therapy that we are developing as a subcutaneous injection for the treatment of PKU. In June 2009, we announced results from a Phase 1 open-label, single-dose, dose-escalation clinical trial of pegvaliase for PKU. Significant reductions in blood Phe levels were observed in all patients in the fifth dosing cohort of the Phase 1 trial. In addition, there were no serious immune reactions observed and mild to moderate injection-site reactions were in line with our expectations. In September 2009, we initiated a Phase 2, open-label dose finding clinical trial of pegvaliase. The primary objective of this clinical trial was to optimize the dose and schedule that produces the most favorable safety profile and Phe reduction. The secondary objectives of the clinical trial were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple dose levels of pegvaliase, to evaluate the immune response to pegvaliase, and to evaluate steady-state pharmacokinetics in all patients and accumulation of pegvaliase in a subset of patients enrolled in this clinical trial. Preliminary results from this clinical trial were presented in August 2010 and showed that of the seven patients who received at least one mg/kg per week of pegvaliase for at least four weeks, six patients had achieved Phe levels below 600 micromoles per liter. Mild to moderate self-limiting injection site reactions are the most commonly reported toxicity. In April 2011, we initiated an extension of the Phase 2 study to find a shorter induction and titration dosing regimen to an efficacious 

maintenance dose. A Phase 3 clinical trial of pegvaliase was initiated in June 2013. This ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial includes an open-label study to evaluate safety and blood Phe levels in na&#239;ve patients and a randomized controlled study of the Phase 2 extension study patients and patients from the open-label trial to evaluate blood Phe levels and neurocognitive endpoints. The FDA has indicated that lowering Phe blood levels in adults could form the basis for an accelerated approval and, additionally, that a favorable outcome on prospectively-specified analyses of inattention in patients with baseline problems with attention would likely be required for full approval. We expect to report results from these trials in the first quarter of 2016. 

Reveglucosidase alfa 

Reveglucosidase alfa is a novel fusion protein of acid alpha glucosidase (GAA) with a peptide derived from IGF2. We acquired the reveglucosidase alfa program in August 2010 in connection with the acquisition of ZyStor Therapeutics, Inc. (ZyStor). In January 2011, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for reveglucosidase alfa. This clinical trial was an open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic and clinical activity of reveglucosidase alfa administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks at doses of up to 20 mg/kg. We completed enrollment of this study in September 2012 with 22 patients between the ages of 13 and 65 years old with late-onset Pompe disease for a treatment period of 24 weeks. The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of reveglucosidase alfa as well as determine the antibody response to reveglucosidase alfa. The secondary objectives of the study were to determine the single and multi-dose pharmacokinetics of reveglucosidase alfa and determine mobility and functional exercise capacity in patients receiving reveglucosidase alfa. Pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in GAA that prevents cells from adequately degrading glycogen. This results in the storage of glycogen in lysosomes, particularly those in muscle cells, thereby damaging those cells and causing progressive muscle weakness, which in turn can result in death due to pulmonary or cardiac insufficiency.

Results from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, released in March 2013, exceeded our prespecified requirements. The results showed that in the 20 mg/kg every other week dose cohort, three out of 16 patients, or 19%, had a greater than 75-meter improvement in six-minute walk distance (6MWD), and that there was a 14.1% relative improvement in Maximal Expiratory Pressure (MEP) and a 27.0% relative improvement in Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) from pretreatment baseline to week 24, two important measures of overall respiratory muscle function and strength. Side effects for reveglucosidase alfa were generally consistent with those seen for other enzyme replacement therapies.

In May 2014, we initiated a Phase 3 switching trial of late onset Pompe patients who had previously been treated with alglucosidase alfa. Interim results were released in January 2016, based on 24 patients who previously had been on treatment with alglucosidase alfa and were switched to reveglucosidase alfa. At week 24, the 18 patients on treatment with reveglucosidase alfa and who completed the study demonstrated respiratory muscle improvements with a mean increase of 2.2 points from baseline in percent predicted MIP and a mean increase of 3.1 points from baseline in percent predicted MEP. Patients completing the study also experienced a mean improvement of 26.1 meters in 6MWD. In the 14 patients who met eligibility at both screening and baseline and completed the study, a mean increase of 3.8 points from baseline in percent predicted MIP also was observed. The 18 patients completing the study showed a mean decrease of 3.7 points from baseline in percent predicted Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), but were considered relatively unchanged from screening at -0.7 points in percent predicted. We will present these data at an upcoming medical meeting. Based on these results, we intend to meet with regulatory authorities to determine the appropriate next steps for the program. In addition, we have improved the manufacturing process for reveglucosidase alfa, which improved process we expect will serve as our commercial manufacturing process. 

Vosoritide 

Vosoritide (formerly referred to as BMN 111) is a peptide therapeutic in development for the treatment of achondroplasia. In September 2012, we announced the results of a Phase 1 clinical trial for vosoritide. The primary objective of the Phase 1 clinical trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of vosoritide in normal healthy adult volunteers up to the maximum tolerated dose. Vosoritide was generally well-tolerated over the range of single and repeat doses studied. Pharmacokinetic data indicated that the dose levels studied resulted in exposure levels that are expected to stimulate growth based on non-clinical findings. In January 2014, we announced the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial for vosoritide for the treatment of children with achondroplasia. This international clinical trial is an open-label, sequential cohort, dose-escalation study of vosoritide in children who are 5-14 years old. The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of daily subcutaneous doses of vosoritide administered for 6 months. The secondary objectives will include an evaluation of change in annualized growth velocity, changes in absolute growth parameters, changes in body proportions and other medically relevant and functional aspects of achondroplasia, such as sleep apnea and joint range of motion. Prior to enrolling in the Phase 2 study, all patients will have participated in a six month natural history study to determine baseline growth velocity data. We completed enrollment in the first three cohorts of this study in November 2014. In June 2015 we reported six-month data for the 26 patients in the first three cohorts of the Phase 2 study, which showed a 50% increase in mean annualized growth velocity in the 15 &#181;g/kg/day dose group of 10 patients compared with their own pre-treatment growth velocity. Vosoritide was also well tolerated across all three dose cohorts. The Phase 2 findings support the advancement of vosoritide into pivotal development, which we are currently discussing with regulatory authorities. 

Cerliponase alfa 

Cerliponase alfa is a recombinant human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 in development for the treatment of patients with CLN2, a form of Batten disease. CLN2 is an incurable, rapidly progressive disease that ends in patient death by 10-12 years of age. Patients are initially healthy but begin to decline at approximately the age of three. We estimate that 1,200-1,600 cases exist worldwide. In September 2013, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1/2 study for cerliponase alfa . This clinical trial is an open-label, dose-escalation study in patients with CLN2. The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of cerliponase alfa and to evaluate effectiveness using a CLN2-specific rating scale score in comparison with natural history data after 48 weeks of treatment. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the impact of treatment on brain atrophy in comparison with CLN2 natural history after 48 weeks of treatment and to characterize pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. This study was fully enrolled in December 2014 with 24 patients. In January 2015, we announced interim data from the study, which indicates that in all nine of the patients in the trial who have been followed for at least six months and up to 15 months, the treatment appears to show stabilization of the disease compared to the natural history based on a standardized measure of motor and language function. All patients were tolerating the therapeutic dose. We expect to announce complete results in March 2016. 

BMN 044, BMN 045, and BMN 053

We acquired BMN 044, BMN 045, and BMN 053, Prosensa&#8217;s additional candidates for the treatment of subsets of DMD, on January 15, 2015. 

BMN 044 (formerly referred to as PRO 044), an exon 44 skipping compound, aims to address a specific mutation in the dystrophin gene that represents approximately 6% of all DMD patients. Prosensa initiated a dose-escalation trial, assessing six doses (0.5, 1.5, 5, 8, 10 and 12 mg/kg/week) in 18 DMD patients in December 2009. Enrollment was completed in the first quarter of 2013, and an extension study has been initiated.

BMN 045 (formerly referred to as PRO 045), an exon 45 skipping compound, aims to address a specific mutation in the dystrophin gene that represents approximately 8% of all DMD patients. Prosensa commenced a Phase 1/2 study of BMN 045 in 15 DMD patients in the first quarter of 2013, which is ongoing. 

BMN 053 (formerly referred to as PRO 053), an exon 53 skipping compound, aims to address a specific mutation in the dystrophin gene that represents approximately 8% of all DMD patients. Prosensa commenced a Phase 1/2 study for BMN 053 in nine DMD patients in September 2013, which is ongoing.

BMN 270

BMN 270 is an AAV-factor VIII vector, designed to restore factor VIII plasma concentrations, essential for blood clotting in patients with hemophilia A. Hemophilia A, also called factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency or classic hemophilia, is a genetic disorder caused by missing or defective factor VIII, a clotting protein. People living with the disease are not able to form blood clots efficiently and are at risk for excessive bleeding from modest injuries, potentially endangering their lives. People with severe hemophilia often bleed spontaneously into their muscles or joints. The gene therapy program for hemophilia A was originally licensed from University College London and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in February 2013 and has since been developed at our facilities. In September 2015, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1/2 study of BMN 270. The Phase 1/2 study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of BMN 270 gene therapy in up to 12 patients with severe hemophilia A. The primary endpoints are to assess the safety of a single intravenous administration of a recombinant AAV, human-coagulation Factor VIII vector and to determine the change from baseline of Factor VIII expression level at 16 weeks after infusion. The kinetics, duration and magnitude of AAV-mediated Factor VIII activity in individuals with hemophilia A will be determined and correlated to an appropriate BMN 270 dose. This is a dose escalation study with the goal of observing an increase in Factor VIII levels. Secondary endpoints include assessing the impact of BMN 270 on the frequency of Factor VIII replacement therapy, the number of bleeding episodes requiring treatment and any potential immune responses. Patients will be monitored for safety for five years.

Manufacturing 

We manufacture Naglazyme, Aldurazyme, Vimizim, pegvaliase, vosoritide and cerliponase alfa in our production facility located in Novato, California. These facilities have demonstrated compliance with GMPs to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EC and health agencies in other countries for the commercial production of Aldurazyme, Naglazyme and Vimizim. Vialing and packaging are performed by contract manufacturers. We believe that we have ample manufacturing capacity to support commercial demand for both Naglazyme and Aldurazyme for at least the next five years. 

In August 2011, we acquired a bulk biologics manufacturing plant located in Shanbally, County of Cork, Ireland. Our manufacturing facility in Shanbally, Cork, Ireland has been approved by the Health Product Regulatory Authorities, FDA, the EC, and health agencies in other countries for the testing and release of Vimizim. We recently began manufacturing Vimizim in this facility. The addition of the Shanbally facility, once approved for bulk substance production, will enhance our business continuity and increase our operating capacity to support the anticipated commercial demand of Vimizim for the next five years. We believe that with this facility and our Novato, California facility, we have ample manufacturing capacity to support commercial demand for Vimizim for at least the next five years. Additionally, we intend to manufacture cerliponase alfa, pegvaliase and vosoritide in this facility. 

Kuvan tablet and powder sachet, Firdapse, Kyndrisa, reveglucosidase alfa and BMN 270 are each manufactured on a contract basis by a third party. In general, we expect to continue to contract with outside service providers for certain manufacturing services, including drug substance, active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), final product vialing, tableting and sachet production and packaging operations for our products. All of our facilities and those of any third-party manufacturers will be subject to periodic inspections confirming compliance with applicable law and must pass inspection before we can manufacture our drugs for commercial sales. Third-party manufacturers&#8217; facilities are subject to periodic inspections to confirm compliance with applicable law and must be GMP certified. We believe that our current agreements with third-party manufacturers and suppliers provide for ample operating capacity to support the anticipated clinical and commercial demand for these products. In certain instances, there is only one approved contract manufacturer for certain aspects of the manufacturing process. In such cases, we attempt to prevent disruption of supplies through supply agreements, maintaining safety stock and other appropriate strategies. Although we have never experienced a disruption in supply from our contract manufacturers, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience a disruption in the future.

Raw Materials 

Raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products and product candidates are available in some instances from one supplier and in other instances from multiple suppliers. In those cases where raw materials are only available through one supplier, such supplier may be either a sole source (the only recognized supply source available to us) or a single source (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We have adopted policies to attempt, to the extent feasible, to minimize our raw material supply risks, including maintenance of greater levels of raw materials inventory and implementation of multiple raw materials sourcing strategies, especially for critical raw materials. Although to date we have not experienced any significant delays in obtaining any raw materials from our suppliers, we cannot provide assurance that we will not face shortages from one or more of them in the future.

Sales and Marketing 

We have established a commercial organization, including a sales force, to support our product lines directly in the U.S., Europe, South America and certain other significant markets. For other selected markets, we have signed agreements with other companies to act as distributors of Vimizim, Naglazyme and Kuvan. Most of these agreements generally grant the distributor the right to market the product in the territory and the obligation to secure all necessary regulatory approvals for commercial or named patient sales. Additional markets are being assessed at this time and additional agreements may be signed in the future. 

In the U.S., our products are marketed through our commercial teams, including sales representatives and supporting staff members, who promote Vimizim, Naglazyme and Kuvan, directly to physicians in specialties appropriate for each product. Outside of the U.S., our sales representatives and supporting staff members market Vimizim, Naglazyme, Kuvan and Firdapse. We believe that with moderate changes in 2016, the size of our sales force will be appropriate to effectively reach our target audience in markets where Vimizim, Naglazyme, Kuvan and Firdapse are directly marketed. Further growth of our current marketed products and the launch of any future products will likely require expansion of our commercial organization, including our sales force, in the U.S. and abroad, and we would need to commit significant additional funds, management&#8217;s attention and other resources to such expansion. 

We utilize third-party logistics companies to store and distribute our products. Moreover, we use third party vendors, such as advertising agencies, market research firms and suppliers of marketing and other sales support-related services, to assist with our commercial activities.

Genzyme has the exclusive right to distribute, market and sell Aldurazyme globally and is required to purchase its requirements exclusively from us. 

Customers 

Our Vimizim, Naglazyme, Kuvan and Firdapse customers include a limited number of specialty pharmacies and end-users, such as hospitals and foreign government agencies. We also sell Vimizim and Naglazyme to our authorized distributors and to certain larger pharmaceutical wholesalers globally, which act as intermediaries between us and end-users and generally do not stock significant quantities of our products. However, in certain countries, particularly in Latin America, governments place large periodic orders for Vimizim and Naglazyme. The timing of these orders can be inconsistent and can create significant quarter to quarter variation in our revenue. During 2015, 42% of our net Vimizim, Naglazyme, Kuvan and Firdapse product revenues were generated by three customers. Genzyme is our sole customer for Aldurazyme and is responsible for marketing and selling Aldurazyme to third-parties. 

Competition 

The biopharmaceutical industry is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Within the industry, there are many public and private companies, including pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies that have or may soon initiate programs for the same indications that our candidate drugs and commercial drugs are intended to treat. Furthermore, universities and non-profit research organizations may have research programs, both early-stage and clinical, in the same disease areas. Our competitors may have advantages over us due to greater financial or scientific resources, lower labor and other costs, or due to higher headcount and more robust organizational structures. Our competitors have considerable experience in drug manufacturing, preclinical and clinical research, regulatory affairs, marketing, sales, and distribution. They pursue broad patent portfolios and other intellectual property to protect the products they are developing. Their products may outcompete ours due to one or more factors, including faster progress through preclinical and clinical development, lower manufacturing costs, superior safety and efficacy, lower pricing, stronger patent protection, and better marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities. In this event, our products, even if approved, could fail to gain significant market share, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

&#160;

Our commercial products have no direct approved competition currently on the market, however, other companies are in the development phase with new and generic products. The following is a summary of some of the primary possible future competitors for our approved products. 

&#160;

Naglazyme, Aldurazyme and Vimizim

&#160;

In the mucopolysaccharidosis field, several companies are researching treatments using small molecules, gene therapy, and other novel technologies. These companies, however, are likely a year or more away from commercial therapies. 

&#160;

Kuvan and Pegvaliase

There are currently no other approved drugs for the treatment of PKU. However, two companies have filed paragraph IV certifications and submitted ANDAs to produce sapropterin dihydrochloride tablets and powder. See the ANDA discussion under &#8220;The Hatch-Waxman Act&#8221; for additional information.

&#160;

Firdapse

&#160;

There are no other approved drugs for the treatment of LEMS, and Firdapse is the only approved version of 3,4-DAP. In some countries, 3,4-DAP is available, as a base, through various compounding pharmacies, as a special or magistral formulation, or through investigator sponsored studies. One U.S. company has begun a clinical trial of a compounded version of 3,4-DAP to treat LEMS. 

&#160;

Pipeline Products

&#160;

Reveglucosidase alfa has competition from Genzyme&#8217;s marketed enzyme replacement products, Myozyme (alglucosidase alfa) and Lumizyme (alglucosidase alfa), and from a third Genzyme product in development. Kyndrisa has competition from Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.&#8217;s product eteplirsen, which like Kyndrisa remains subject to regulatory approval. Our cerliponase alfa program for the treatment of CLN2 has competition from earlier stage products, including a product candidate currently under development by Spark Therapeutics, Inc. Our other pipeline products have competition from earlier stage products, either using similar technology to our programs or different treatment strategies. 

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

Our success depends on an intellectual property portfolio that supports our future revenue streams and also erects barriers to our competitors. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio through: filing new patent applications; prosecuting existing applications; and licensing and acquiring new patents and patent applications. Furthermore we seek to protect our ownership of know-how, trade secrets and trademarks through an active program of legal mechanisms including registrations, assignments, confidentiality agreements, material transfer agreements, research collaborations and licenses. 

As of January 25, 2016, t he number of our worldwide issued patents now stands at 633 , including 82 patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO). Furthermore, our portfolio of pending patent applications totals 4 07 applications, including 86 pending U.S. applications. 

With respect to Naglazyme, we have 52 issued patents, including three U.S. patents. Claims cover our ultrapure N -acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase compositions of Naglazyme, methods of treating deficiencies of N -acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase, including MPS VI, methods of producing and purifying such ultrapure N -acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase compositions and methods of detecting. These patents will expire between 2021 and 2028. 

With respect to Kuvan, we own, co-own or have licensed a number of patents and pending patent applications that relate generally to formulations and forms of our drug substance, methods of use for various indications under development and dosing regimens. We have rights to 107 issued patents including 14 issued U.S. patents with claims to a stable tablet and oral solution formulation of 6R-BH4, methods of treating PKU using a once daily dosing regimen, methods of administration of Kuvan with food, crystalline forms of 6R-BH4, and methods of producing 6R-BH4. These patents will expire between 2024 and 2032. 

We have rights to 33 issued patents, including six U.S. patents, related to Aldurazyme. These patents cover our ultra-pure alpha-L-iduronidase composition of Aldurazyme, methods of treating deficiencies of alpha-L-iduronidase by administering pharmaceutical compositions comprising such ultra-pure alpha-L-iduronidase, a method of purifying such ultra-pure alpha-L-iduronidase and the use of compositions of ultra-pure biologically active fragments of alpha-L-iduronidase. These patents will expire in 2019 and 2020. There are U.S. patents on alpha-L-iduronidase owned and controlled by a third-party. We have examined such issued U.S. patents, the related U.S. and foreign applications and their file histories, the prior art and other information. Corresponding foreign applications were filed in Canada, Europe and Japan. The European application was rejected and abandoned and cannot be re-filed. The Japanese application has also lapsed and cannot be re-filed. Claims in the related Canadian application issued in 2007. We believe that such patents may not survive a challenge to patent validity but that it is unlikely that a court in any country would order us to stop marketing the only life-saving drug that is currently approved for this disease. However, the processes of patent law are uncertain and any patent proceeding is subject to multiple unanticipated outcomes. We believe that it is in the best interest of our joint venture with Genzyme to market Aldurazyme with commercial diligence, in order to provide MPS I patients with the benefits of Aldurazyme. We believe that these patents and patent applications do not affect our ability to market Aldurazyme in Europe. 

We have patent protection in the European Patent Organization countries for Firdapse for the treatment of LEMS. We have no issued patents in the U.S. for Firdapse for the treatment of LEMS. These patents will expire in 2022. 

With respect to Vimizim, we own or have licensed a number of patents and pending patent applications that relate generally to compositions of matter, methods of use and methods of production. We have rights to 39 issued patents including 14 issued U.S. patents with claims to compositions of purified recombinant N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (Vimizim) methods of treating Morquio Syndrome and sulfatase-modifying factor I (SUMF1) polypeptides and nucleic acids used in the manufacture of Vimizim. Issued U.S. patents cover SUMF1 compositions (set to expire in 2019), purified recombinant Vimizim compositions (set to expire in 2029) and methods of treating Morquio Syndrome (set to expire in 2029). We also have issued U.S. and European patents that cover methods of production (set to expire in 2024) and formulations (set to expire in 2031). 

With respect to our clinical product candidates, we believe we have the necessary intellectual property rights to allowing us to undertake the development of these candidates. Certain of our product candidates are in therapeutic areas that have been the subject of many years of extensive research and development by academic organizations and third parties who may control patents or other intellectual property that they might assert against us, should one or more of our product candidates in these therapeutic areas succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and thereafter be commercialized. We continually evaluate the intellectual property rights of others in these areas in order to determine whether a claim of infringement may be made by others against us. Should we determine that a third party has intellectual property rights that could impact our ability to freely market a compound we consider a number of factors in determining how best to prepare for the commercialization of any such product. In making this determination we consider, among other things, the stage of development of our product candidate and whether we and our outside counsel believe the intellectual property rights of others are valid, whether we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, whether a license is available upon commercially reasonable terms, whether we will seek to challenge the intellectual property rights of others, and the likelihood of and liability resulting from an adverse outcome should we be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others. 

Government Regulation 

Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture, commercialization, pricing and reimbursement of our products. Our industry is subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Our present and future business has been, and will continue to be, subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. In the U.S., failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product 

recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 

Our products require approval from the FDA, the EMA and corresponding agencies in other countries before they can be marketed. 

Approval Process in the U.S. and EU 

Pharmaceutical product development in the U.S. and the EU typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the applicable regulatory agency of an application (e.g., an investigational new drug application (IND) or a clinical trial application (CTA)), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which marketing approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA and EMA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation, as well as animal studies, to assess the characteristics and potential pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicity of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with FDA and/or EMA regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing, along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol are submitted to the applicable regulatory agency as part of an IND or CTA. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND or CTA is submitted. Until the CTA or IND is approved, or deemed approved following a waiting period, we may not start the clinical trial in the relevant jurisdiction. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with applicable regulations, good clinical practices (GCP), as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial and the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and to the relevant regulatory agency in the EU as part of a new CTA. 

The regulatory agencies may order the temporary halt or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if they believe that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee, for approval. An IRB/ethics committee may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB/ethics committee&#8217;s requirements, or may impose other conditions. 

Clinical trials to support NDAs, biologics license applications (BLAs), or MAAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA and an MAA is prepared and submitted to the EMA. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. and approval of the MAA by the EC is required before marketing of the product may begin in the EU. The NDA, BLA or MAA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing, a compilation of data relating to the product&#8217;s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls and proposed labeling, among other things. In the U.S., each NDA or BLA is subject to a significant user fee at the time of submission, unless a waiver is granted by the FDA. 

The FDA and the EMA initially review the applications for a threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, typically within 30-60 days. The FDA or the EMA may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA/BLA or MAA, respectively, for filing or validation. Once the submission is accepted, the applicable agency begins an in-depth review. For the FDA, the review period for standard review applications is typically an additional ten months and, for priority review of drugs, that is, drugs that the FDA determines address a significant unmet need and represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, the review period is typically an additional six months in duration. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information submitted during the review or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. After the FDA evaluates the information provided in the NDA/BLA, it 

issues an approval letter, or a complete response letter. A complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed, the FDA will re-initiate review. If it is satisfied that the deficiencies have been addressed, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. It is not unusual, however, for the FDA to issue a complete response letter because it believes that the drug is not safe enough or effective enough or because it does not believe that the data submitted are reliable or conclusive. 

For the EMA, an application designated as standard review typically lasts approximately eleven months depending on the length of time sponsors take to address EMA questions. The accelerated assessment procedure is applicable to marketing authorization applications for medicinal products that are expected to be of major public health interest. For applications that receive accelerated assessment designation and are able to remain on this timeline the review typically lasts approximately seven months depending on the length of time sponsors take to address EMA questions. It is not unusual, however, for applications that receive accelerated assessment designation to revert to standard review, typically because the EMA has determined that the significance of the questions that the company needs to address would be more appropriate under the standard review timelines. At the end of the review period, EMA will issue an opinion either in support of marketing authorization (positive opinion) or recommending refusal of a marketing authorization (negative opinion). In the event of a negative opinion, the company may request a re-examination of the application. Within 60 days the company must provide the EMA detailed grounds for requesting re-examination. Within 60 days of providing this information, the EMA will issue an opinion either in support of marketing authorization (positive opinion) or recommending refusal of a marketing authorization (negative opinion). In the event of a positive opinion, the EC will then grant marketing authorization in approximately 67 days. The EC follows the recommendation of the EMA in almost all cases. 

During the review period, the FDA and/or the EMA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites and/or the sponsor to assure compliance with GCP regulations and will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured to ensure compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) regulations. Neither the FDA nor the EMA will approve the product unless compliance is satisfactory and the application contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. 

A marketing approval authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug&#8217;s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 

Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 

Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial are then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. Moreover, there is an increasing trend in the EU requiring public disclosure of development data, in particular clinical trial data. These data were traditionally regarded as confidential commercial information; however, under policies recently adopted in the EU, clinical study data submitted to the EMA in MAAs, including pre-clinical data, and patient level data, may be subject to public disclosure.

The Hatch-Waxman Act 

Upon approval of a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to submit to the FDA each patent that covers the applicant&#8217;s product or FDA approved method of using this product. Those patents are then published in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strength(s), route of administration, and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as &#8220;generic equivalents&#8221; to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 

The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the 

listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product&#8217;s listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. Alternatively, for a patent covering an approved method of use, an ANDA applicant may submit a statement to the FDA that the company is not seeking approval for the covered use. 

If the ANDA applicant has submitted a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 

The ANDA application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active moiety, during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new condition of use, the approval of which was required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor, during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA based on that listed drug. Both of the five-year and three-year exclusivity periods, as well as any unexpired patents listed in the Orange Book for the listed drug, can be extended by six months if the FDA grants the NDA sponsor a period of pediatric exclusivity based on studies submitted by the sponsor in response to a written request. 

Orphan Drug Designation 

Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA and EMA to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which in the U.S. is defined as having a prevalence of less than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and in the EU is defined as no more than five in 10,000 people in the EU, which is equivalent to around 250,000 people or less. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a marketing application. 

Orphan drug designation does not shorten the regulatory review and approval process, nor does it provide any advantage in the regulatory review and approval process. However, if an orphan drug later receives approval for the indication for which it has designation, the relevant regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years in the U.S. and ten years in the EU. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA/BLA application user fee. Although obtaining approval to market a product with orphan drug exclusivity may be advantageous, we cannot be certain: 

&#160;

&#183; 

that we will be the first to obtain approval for any drug for which we obtain orphan drug designation; 

&#160;

&#183; 

that orphan drug designation will result in any commercial advantage or reduce competition; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

that the limited exceptions to this exclusivity will not be invoked by the relevant regulatory authority. 

Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may be lost under certain conditions, such as if the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug. 

Breakthrough Therapy Designation

The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor&#8217;s request.

Pediatric Information 

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2007 (PREA), NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indication(s) in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for 

submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan drug designation has been granted. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) provides sponsors of NDAs with an additional six-month period of market exclusivity for all unexpired patent or non-patent exclusivity on all forms of the drug containing the active moiety if the sponsor submits results of pediatric studies specifically requested by the FDA under BPCA within required timeframes. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) provides sponsors of BLAs an additional six-month extension for all unexpired non-patent market exclusivity on all forms of the biological containing the active moiety pursuant to the BPCA if the conditions under the BPCA are met. 

Fast Track Designation 

The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the FDA&#8217;s fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor&#8217;s request. 

In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug&#8217;s NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA&#8217;s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA or BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 

Post-Approval Regulatory Requirements 

Following approval, the FDA and the EMA will impose certain post-approval requirements related to a product. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of approved products, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. 

Approved products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a submission to and approval by the FDA or the EMA, as applicable, before the change can be implemented. An NDA/BLA or MAA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and similar procedures and actions in reviewing NDA/ BLA or MAA supplements as in reviewing NDAs/BLAs and MAAs. 

Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following marketing approval. Either the FDA or EMA may also require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as the manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug and biological product manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA or the EMA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to access compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, prescription drug manufactures in the U.S. must comply with applicable provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and provide and receive product tracing information, maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work with other properly licensed entities and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate products. 

Good Manufacturing Practices

The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and biologic products prior to approving a product. If, after receiving approval from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. All facilities and manufacturing techniques used for the manufacture of our products must comply with applicable regulations governing the production of pharmaceutical products known as &#8220;Good Manufacturing Practices,&#8221; or GMPs. 

The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies also conduct regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities and processes following initial approval of a product. If, as a result of these inspections, it is determined that our equipment, facilities or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, regulatory agencies may require product recall, issue warning or similar letters or may seek civil, criminal, or administrative sanctions against us. 

Health Reform 

The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. For example, in the U.S. the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (as amended, the PPACA), is a sweeping measure intended to improve quality of care, constrain healthcare spending, and expand healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program. 

The BPCIA, which was enacted as part of the PPACA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be &#8220;biosimilar&#8221; or &#8220;interchangeable&#8221; with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-licensed product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical study, absent a waiver from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In order to meet the higher hurdle of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product. The first biosimilar product was approved under the BPCIA in 2015, though no interchangeable products have been approved to date. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being evaluated by the FDA. A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) eighteen months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is not patent challenge, (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar&#8217;s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. 

The PPACA also imposes a new fee on certain manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs (excluding orphan drugs under certain conditions). The annual fee will be apportioned among the participating companies based on each company&#8217;s sales of qualifying products to, or use by, certain U.S. government programs during the preceding year. Other provisions of the new law, which have varying effective dates, may also affect us and will likely increase certain of our costs. For example, the Medicaid rebate rate was increased and the volume of rebated drugs has been expanded to include beneficiaries in Medicaid managed care organizations. Among other things, the PPACA also expands the 340B drug discount program (excluding orphan drugs), including the creation of new penalties for non-compliance and includes a 50% discount on brand name drugs for Medicare Part D participants in the coverage gap, or &#8220;donut hole.&#8221; The law also revised the definition of &#8220;average manufacturer price&#8221; for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of the Medicaid drug rebates paid to states. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been added, which may require us to modify our business practices with health care practitioners. 

In addition, drug manufacturers are required to collect and report annually information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. The reported data are posted in searchable form on a public web site. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. It is still unclear the full impact that the PPACA will have on our business. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and we expect that there will be additional challenges and amendments in the future.

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes included the Budget Control Act of 2011, which caused aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 1, 2013 which, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers. Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.

Other U.S. Regulatory Requirements 

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback, false claims, patient data privacy and security, and transparency statutes and regulations. 

The federal A nti- K ickback S tatute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. The PPACA amended the intent requirement of the federal A nti- K ickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to commit a violation . This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. 

Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. The PPACA amended the statute so that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims laws. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn are used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. 

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters.

&#160;

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain types of individuals and entities, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.

The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members.

The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, exclusion of a company&#8217;s products from reimbursement under federal healthcare programs, criminal fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, curtailment of operations and imprisonment. Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states. Other states prohibit providing various other marketing-related activities. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, states including California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. Currently, several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. 

Approval Outside of the U.S./EU 

For marketing outside the U.S. and the EU, we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing and marketing approval for our products. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, can differ from those in the U.S. and the EU and may require us to perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. The amount of time required to obtain necessary approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA or the EMA approval. In many countries outside of the U.S., coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required. 

Anti-Corruption Legislation 

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Similar laws 

exist in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, that restrict improper payments to public and private parties. Many countries have laws prohibiting these types of payments within the respective country. Historically, pharmaceutical companies have been the target of FCPA and other anti-corruption investigations and penalties. 

Pricing and Reimbursement 

Because the course of treatment for patients using our products is expensive, sales of our products depend, in significant part, on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement offered by third party payers, including government payers and private insurance plans. Governments may regulate access to, prices of or reimbursement levels for our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products, and private insurers may be influenced by government reimbursement methodologies. 

Third-party payers, such as government or private health care insurers, carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for drugs, examine their medical necessity, and review their cost effectiveness. Reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the third-party payer, the insurance plan and other factors. One payer&#8217;s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage for the product. Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payer will pay for the product. A payer&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

Outside of the U.S. our products are paid for by a variety of payers, with governments being the primary source of payment. Reimbursement in the EU and many other territories must be negotiated on a country-by-country basis and in many countries the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved. In many countries the government closely regulates drug pricing and reimbursement and often has a significant discretion in determining whether a product will be reimbursed at all and, if it is, how much will be paid. Negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay patient access to and commercialization of our products. Payers in many countries use a variety of cost-containment measures that can include referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set their own price, mandatory price cuts and rebates. This international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices across countries and some cross-border trade in our products from markets with lower prices. Even after a price is negotiated, countries frequently request or require adjustments to the price and other concessions over time. 

Government Programs for Marketed Drugs in the U.S. 

Medicaid, the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and Medicare 

Federal law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer, as a condition of having its products receive federal reimbursement under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, must pay rebates to state Medicaid programs for all units of its covered outpatient drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program under either a fee-for-service arrangement or through a managed care organization. This federal requirement is effectuated through a Medicaid drug rebate agreement between the manufacturer and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. CMS administers the Medicaid drug rebate agreements, which provide, among other things, that the drug manufacturer will pay rebates to each state Medicaid agency on a quarterly basis and report certain price information on a monthly and quarterly basis. The rebates are based on prices reported to CMS by manufacturers for their covered outpatient drugs. For non-innovator products, generally generic drugs marketed under ANDAs, the rebate amount is 13% of the average manufacturer price (AMP) for the quarter. The AMP is the weighted average of prices paid to the manufacturer (1) directly by retail community pharmacies and (2) by wholesalers for drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies. For innovator products (i.e., drugs that are marketed under NDAs or BLAs), the rebate amount is the greater of 23.1% of the AMP for the quarter or the difference between such AMP and the best price for that same quarter. The best price is essentially the lowest price available to non-governmental entities. Innovator products may also be subject to an additional rebate that is based on the amount, if any, by which the product&#8217;s AMP for a given quarter exceeds the inflation-adjusted baseline AMP, which for most drugs is the AMP for the first full quarter after launch. Beginning in 2017, non-innovator products will also be subject to an additional rebate.

The statutory definition of AMP was amended in 2010, and there are many ambiguities in the revised provision. CMS has released the final rule pertaining to AMP and other aspects of the Medicaid drug rebate program. This final rule will be effective as of April 1, 2016.

The terms of participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in additional or lesser rebate liability, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates, if a manufacturer were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the 

government, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information. 

A manufacturer must also participate in a federal program known as the 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available to pay for the manufacturer&#8217;s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Under this program, the participating manufacturer agrees to charge certain safety net healthcare providers no more than an established discounted price for its covered outpatient drugs. The formula for determining the discounted price is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and the unit rebate amount as calculated under the Medicaid drug rebate program, discussed above. 

Federal law also requires that manufacturers report data on a quarterly basis to CMS regarding the pricing of drugs that are separately reimbursable under Medicare Part B. These are generally drugs, such as injectable products, that are administered &#8220;incident to&#8221; a physician service and are not generally self-administered. The pricing information submitted by manufacturers is the basis for reimbursement to physicians and suppliers for drugs covered under Medicare Part B. As with the Medicaid drug rebate program, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information. 

Medicare Part D provides prescription drug benefits for seniors and people with disabilities. Medicare Part D beneficiaries have a gap in their coverage (between the initial coverage limit and the point at which catastrophic coverage begins) where Medicare does not cover their prescription drug costs, known as the coverage gap. However, by 2020 Medicare Part D beneficiaries will pay 25% of drug costs after they reach the initial coverage limit &#8211; the same percentage they were responsible for before they reached that limit &#8211; thereby closing the coverage gap. The cost of closing the coverage gap is being borne by innovator companies and the government through subsidies. Beginning in 2011, each manufacturer of drugs approved under NDAs or BLAs was required to enter into a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount agreement and provide a 50% discount on those drugs dispensed to Medicare beneficiaries in the coverage gap, in order for its drugs to be reimbursed by Medicare Part D. 

Federal Contracting/Pricing Requirements 

Manufacturers are also required to make their covered drugs, which are generally drugs approved under NDAs or BLAs, available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) of the General Services Administration. The law also requires manufacturers to offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing for purchases of their covered drugs by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, and the Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service) in order for federal funding to be available for reimbursement or purchase of the manufacturer&#8217;s drugs under certain federal programs. FSS pricing to those four federal agencies for covered drugs must be no more than the Federal Ceiling Price (FCP), which is at least 24% below the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (Non-FAMP) for the prior year. The Non-FAMP is the average price for covered drugs sold to wholesalers or other middlemen, net of any price reductions. 

The accuracy of a manufacturer&#8217;s reported Non-FAMPs, FCPs, or FSS contract prices may be audited by the government. Among the remedies available to the government for inaccuracies is recoupment of any overcharges to the four specified federal agencies based on those inaccuracies. If a manufacturer were found to have knowingly reported false prices, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the law provides for civil monetary penalties of $100,000 per incorrect item. Finally, manufacturers are required to disclose in FSS contract proposals all commercial pricing that is equal to or less than the proposed FSS pricing, and subsequent to award of an FSS contract, manufacturers are required to monitor certain commercial price reductions and extend commensurate price reductions to the government, under the terms of the FSS contract Price Reductions Clause. Among the remedies available to the government for any failure to properly disclose commercial pricing and/or to extend FSS contract price reductions is recoupment of any FSS overcharges that may result from such omissions. 

Employees 

As of January 25, 2016, we had 2,158 full-time employees, 882 of whom were in operations, 648 of whom were in research and development, 299 of whom were in sales and marketing and 329 of whom were in administration. 

We consider our employee relations to be good. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced employment related work stoppages. 

Research and Development 

For information regarding research and development expenses incurred during 2015, 2014 and 2013, see Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Research and Development. 

Geographic Area Financial Information 

Our chief operating decision maker (i.e., our chief executive officer) reviews financial information on a consolidated basis, for the purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. Accordingly, we consider ourselves to have a single reporting segment and operating unit structure. 

Net product revenues by geography are based on patients&#8217; locations for Vimizim, Naglazyme, Kuvan and Firdapse which are sold directly by us, and global sales of Aldurazyme which is marketed by Genzyme. Genzyme is our sole customer for Aldurazyme and is responsible for marketing and selling Aldurazyme to third-parties. Net product revenues from Genzyme consist of royalties on worldwide net Aldurazyme sales and incremental product transfer revenues. Although Genzyme sells Aldurazyme worldwide, the royalties earned by us on Genzyme&#8217;s net sales are not broken out by geographic region as the underlying revenue transactions are with Genzyme, whose headquarters are located in the U.S.

The increase in non-monetary long-lived assets in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to increased IPR&#38;D. The increase in intangible assets was primarily attributable to Kyndrisa and other exon-skipping in-process research and development assets we acquired in connection with our acquisition of Prosensa in January 2015. The increase in non-monetary long-lived assets in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily attributable to increases in property, plant and equipment and deferred tax assets.
