Business 

Overview 

We are a nationally recognized retailer of high-quality, branded apparel at everyday low prices. We opened our first store in Burlington, New Jersey in 1972, selling primarily coats and outerwear. Since then, we have expanded our store base to 567 stores as of January 30, 2016, inclusive of an internet store, in 45 states and Puerto Rico, and diversified our product categories by offering an extensive selection of in-season, fashion-focused merchandise, including: women&#8217;s ready-to-wear apparel, menswear, youth apparel, baby, footwear, accessories, home and coats. We sell a broad selection of desirable, first-quality, current-brand, labeled merchandise acquired directly from nationally recognized manufacturers and other suppliers. For the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016, we generated total revenue of $5,129.8 million and net sales of $5,098.9 million, and earned net income, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA (as subsequently defined in this Form 10-K) of $150.5 million, $174.6 million and $484.0 million, respectively. 

As used in this Annual Report, the terms &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Burlington Stores, Inc. and all its subsidiaries. We were organized in 2013 under the name Burlington Holdings, Inc. and currently exist as a Delaware corporation. Our indirect subsidiary, Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corporation (BCFWC), was initially organized in 1972 as a New Jersey corporation, was reincorporated in 1983 in Delaware when the company originally became a public company and currently exists as a Delaware corporation. BCFWC became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Burlington Coat Factory Investments Holdings, Inc. in connection with the acquisition of BCFWC in April 2006 by affiliates of Bain Capital Partners, LLC (along with its associated investment funds, or any successor to its investment management business, Bain Capital) in a take private transaction (the Merger Transaction) and became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of ours on February 14, 2013 in connection with our corporate reorganization. We completed an initial public offering of our common stock in October 2013. 

Fiscal Year End 

We define our fiscal year as the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. This is an annual report for the 52 week fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 (Fiscal 2015). The fiscal years ended January 31, 2015 (Fiscal 2014) and February 1, 2014 (Fiscal 2013) also consisted of 52 weeks. 

Our Stores 

As of January 30, 2016, we operated 567 stores, inclusive of an internet store. Over 98% of our net sales are derived from stores we operate as Burlington stores (Burlington Stores). We believe that our customers are attracted to our stores principally by the availability of a large assortment of first-quality current brand-name merchandise at everyday low prices. 

Burlington Stores offer customers a complete line of value-priced apparel, including: ladies sportswear, menswear, coats, family footwear and youth apparel as well as baby furniture, accessories, home d&#233;cor and gifts. We continue to emphasize our rich heritage of coats and outerwear and we believe that we are viewed as the destination for coat shoppers. Our broad selection provides a wide range of apparel, accessories and furnishing for all ages. We purchase both pre-season and in-season merchandise, allowing us to respond timely to changing market conditions and consumer fashion preferences. Furthermore, we believe Burlington Stores&#8217; substantial selection of staple, destination products attracts customers from beyond our local trade areas. We believe these products drive incremental store-traffic and differentiate us from our competitors. 

In some of our stores, we grant unaffiliated third parties the right to use designated store space solely for the purpose of selling such third parties&#8217; goods, primarily fragrances. During Fiscal 2015, our rental income from all such arrangements aggregated less than 1% of our total revenues. We do not own or have any rights to any trademarks, licenses or other intellectual property used in connection with the brands sold by such unaffiliated third parties. During Fiscal 2015, we began the conversion our fragrance business, which was previously operated under a licensing arrangement, to an owned category, and such sales are recorded in the line item &#8220;Net sales&#8221; in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. By the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2016, we expect fragrances will be exclusively an owned business.

We believe the breadth of our selection and our ability to successfully operate in stores of varying square footage represent a competitive advantage. Our average store size is approximately 77,000 square feet. We believe that as we continue to reduce our comparable store inventory, we will be able to reduce the square footage of our stores while continuing to maintain our broad assortment. As a result, we believe major landlords seek us as a tenant because the appeal of our apparel merchandise profile attracts a desired customer base. 

&#160;

Our store base is geographically diversified wi th stores located in 45 states and Puerto Rico.

Our store sales area is organized by merchandise category with flexibility to quickly expand or contract category offerings in response to changes in consumer preferences. Our typical store features open sight lines, bright overhead lighting and clear signage to promote easy navigation through the store. We highlight the best brands and freshest product in four way fixtures along the aisles with additional merchandise arranged by size in H-racks. We believe our clean, organized merchandise presentation highlights the brands, value, selection and sizing within assortments and promotes a self-service, treasure hunt experience for our customers. 

Our store managers are accountable for the sales and profitability of their stores. The store leadership team is comprised of managers and assistant managers. The stores are led by their regional team, consisting of a regional vice president and regional managers in operations, human resources and loss prevention. The regional vice president sets the priorities for the team and ensures the stores are supported in their overall mission to grow sales and profitability. 

Store Expansion and Real Estate Strategy 

We continue to explore expansion opportunities both within our current market areas and in other regions. We believe that our ability to find satisfactory locations for our stores is essential for the continued growth of our business. The opening of stores generally is contingent upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the availability of desirable locations with suitable structures and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to find suitable locations for new stores or that even if such locations are found and acceptable lease terms are obtained, we will be able to open the number of new stores presently planned. 

We have a proven track record of new store expansion. Our store base has grown from 13 stores in 1980 to 567 stores, inclusive of an internet store, as of January 30, 2016. Assuming that appropriate locations are identified, we believe that we will be able to execute our growth strategy without significantly impacting our current stores. We have identified numerous market opportunities that we believe will allow us to reach 1,000 stores over the long-term. The table below shows our store openings and closings since the beginning of Fiscal 2013.

Distribution and Warehousing

In addition, we operate three warehousing facilities to support our distribution centers. The east coast has two supporting warehouses in Burlington, New Jersey and in Florence, New Jersey. The west coast has one supporting warehouse in Redlands, California. These three warehousing facilities occupy an aggregate of 1,056,000 square feet and primarily serve as storage facilities.

Customer Service 

We are committed to providing our customers with an enjoyable shopping experience and strive to make continuous efforts to improve customer service. In training our employees, our goal is to emphasize knowledgeable, friendly customer service and a sense of professional pride. We offer our customers special services to enhance the convenience of their shopping experience, such as professional tailors, a baby gift registry and layaways. 

We have empowered our store teams to provide an outstanding customer experience for every customer in every store, every day. We have streamlined processes and will continue to strive to create opportunities for fast and effective customer interactions. Our stores must reflect clean, organized merchandise presentations that highlight the brands, value, and diversity of selection within our assortments. 

Our Off-Price Sourcing and Merchandising Model 

Our &#8220;open to buy&#8221; off-price model enables us to provide our customers with products that are nationally branded, fashionable, high quality and priced right. We have an experienced team of General Merchandise Managers, Divisional Merchandise Managers and buyers focused on improving comparable store inventory turnover, inventory age and freshness of merchandise. We purchase merchandise from many suppliers, none of which accounted for more than 2% of our net purchases during Fiscal 2015. We have no long-term purchase commitments or arrangements with any of our suppliers, and believe that we are not dependent on any one supplier. We continue to have good working relationships with our suppliers. 

We have designed our merchant organization so that buyers focus primarily on buying, planners focus primarily on planning, and information systems help inform data-driven decisions for both groups. Buyers are in the market each week and focus on purchasing great products for great value. We seek to purchase a majority of our merchandise in-season. Buyers spend time interacting face-to-face with new and existing vendors and on continuously evaluating trends in the market to which we believe our customers would respond positively. Our buyers use a merchant scorecard that rates products across four key attributes&#8212;fashion, quality, brand and price&#8212;to help formalize a framework for buying decisions. 

&#160;

E-Commerce 

We employ an e-commerce strategy currently focused on increasing awareness of the breadth of our merchandise selection, great brands and values, as well as driving traffic to our stores and selling merchandise directly from our website. We execute our strategy through our website and through social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest. In Fall 2013, we re-launched our website with a significantly upgraded user experience &#8211; including improved navigation, shopping functionality and a more modern layout to increase site traffic and conversion rates. This re-launch also included an expansion of the online merchandise assortment to include additional items across women&#8217;s ready-to-wear apparel, menswear, youth apparel, baby, accessories, home and coats. As a part of this re-launch, we also updated the cross-channel Baby Registry currently serving our Baby Depot customers. 

Customer Demographic 

Our core customer is the 25-49 year-old woman. The core customer is educated, resides in mid- to large-sized metropolitan areas and is a brand conscious fashion enthusiast. This customer shops for herself, her family, and her home. We appeal to value seeking and fashion conscious customers who are price-driven but enjoy the style and fit of high-quality, branded merchandise. 

Marketing and Advertising 

We use a variety of broad-based and targeted marketing strategies to efficiently deliver the right message to the targeted audience at the right time. These strategies include national television, direct mail, email, digital marketing, local radio and out-of-home communications. Our broad television broadcast communication and reach is balanced with relevant customer contacts to increase frequency of store visits. 

Management Information Systems and Processes 

We utilize a combination of primarily industry-standard third party and internally developed information technology and system solutions across our business functions. We continually evaluate and implement business system technology and solutions that enhance the consistency of our execution and improve the scalability of business system functions across a growing store base. We utilize a testing methodology which allows us to evaluate new initiatives across our entire organization and make data-driven decisions that support growth and minimize costs. To date, we have performed tests in store operations, merchandise presentation, advertising and marketing, among other areas. 

Competition 

The U.S. retail apparel and home furnishings markets are highly fragmented and competitive. We compete for business with department stores, off-price retailers, specialty stores, discount stores, wholesale clubs, and outlet stores. At various times throughout the year, traditional full-price department store chains and specialty shops offer brand-name merchandise at substantial markdowns, which can result in prices approximating those offered by us at our Burlington Stores. 

Seasonality 

Our business, like that of most retailers, is subject to seasonal influences, with the major portion of sales and income typically realized during the back-to-school and holiday seasons (September through January). Weather is also a contributing factor to the sale of our clothing. Generally, our sales are higher if the weather is cold during the Fall and warm during the early Spring. 

&#160;

Trademarks 

We own the trademarks, service marks and tradenames that we use in connection with the operation of our business. Our trademarks include &#8220;Burlington Stores,&#8221; &#8220;BCF,&#8221; &#8220;Burlington,&#8221; &#8220;Burlington Coat Factory,&#8221; &#8220;Cohoes,&#8221; &#8220;Luxury Linens,&#8221; &#8220;MJM Designer Shoes,&#8221; and &#8220;Baby Depot.&#8221; We consider these trademarks and the accompanying name recognition to be valuable to our business. We believe that our rights to these properties are adequately protected. Our rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used. 

Employees 

As of January 30, 2016, we employed approximately 37,500 people, including part-time and seasonal employees. Our staffing requirements fluctuate during the year as a result of the seasonality of our business. We hire additional employees and increase the hours of part-time employees during seasonal peak selling periods. As of January 30, 2016, employees at two of our stores were subject to collective bargaining agreements.

Therefore, we file reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
