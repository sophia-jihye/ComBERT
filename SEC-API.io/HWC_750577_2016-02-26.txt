 ITEM 1. BUSINESS ORGANIZATION AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

Hancock Holding Company (which we refer to as &#147;Hancock&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a financial services company that provides a comprehensive network of full-service financial choices to the Gulf South region through its bank subsidiary, Whitney Bank (the &#147;Bank&#148;), a Mississippi state bank. Whitney Bank operates under two century-old brands: &#147;Hancock Bank&#148; in Mississippi, Alabama and Florida and &#147;Whitney Bank&#148; in Louisiana and Texas. Whitney Bank also operates a loan production office in Nashville, Tennessee under both the Hancock and Whitney Bank brands. 

Hancock was organized in 1984 as a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. In 2002, the Company qualified as a financial holding company giving it broader powers. The corporate headquarters of the Company is in Gulfport, Mississippi. 

Historically, our growth was primarily through internal branch expansions into areas of population that were not served by a dominant financial institution and through several small acquisitions. In 2009, we acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of Panama City, Florida based Peoples First Community Bank (Peoples First) in a transaction with financial assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) adding approximately $2 billion in assets. In 2011, we acquired all of the common stock of Whitney Holding Corporation (Whitney), a bank holding company based in New Orleans, adding $11.7 billion in assets, $6.5 billion in loans, and $9.2 billion in deposits. Our growth since the Whitney acquisition has been organic through the expansion of products that are targeted across the Company&#146;s footprint. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we opened a loan production office in Nashville, Tennessee, further expanding our lending footprint. 

At December 31, 2015, our balance sheet has grown to $22.8 billion, with loans totaling $15.7 billion, deposits totaling $18.3 billion and 3,921 employees on a full-time equivalent basis. 

NATURE OF BUSINESS AND MARKETS 

The Bank operates across the Gulf South region comprised of southern Mississippi; southern and central Alabama; southern Louisiana; the northern, central, and panhandle regions of Florida; Houston, Texas; and Nashville, Tennessee. The Bank offers a broad range of traditional and online community banking services to commercial, small business and retail customers, providing a variety of transaction and savings deposit products, treasury management services, investment brokerage services, secured and unsecured loan products (including revolving credit facilities), and letters of credit and similar financial guarantees. The Bank also provides trust and investment management services to retirement plans, corporations and individuals. 

We also offer other services through nonbank subsidiaries. Hancock Investment Services, Inc. provides discount investment brokerage services, annuity products, and life insurance. Harrison Finance Company provides consumer financing services. We also have several special purpose subsidiaries to facilitate investment in new market tax credit activities and others that operate and sell certain foreclosed assets. Total revenue from nonbank subsidiaries accounted for less than ten percent of our consolidated revenue in 2015. 

In April, 2014, Hancock sold its property and casualty and group benefits lines of business that had been housed within its subsidiary insurance agencies. Hancock established a referral program through which the Bank can continue to arrange these services for our clients. Although the lines of business divested represented approximately half of the Company&#146;s 2013 insurance revenue, their sale did not have a material impact on operating results. 

During the fourth quarter of 2015, Hancock opened a loan production office in Nashville, Tennessee and purchased approximately $185 million of healthcare loans. This transaction supports our initiative to continue diversifying our loan portfolio, in addition to capitalizing on opportunities to expand our participation in the healthcare sector across our Gulf South footprint. 

&#160; 

Our operating strategy is to provide customers with the financial sophistication and range of products of a regional bank, while successfully retaining the commercial appeal and level of service of a community bank. Hancock&#146;s size and scale enables us to attract and retain high quality employees, whom we refer to as associates, who are focused on executing this strategy. 

The main industries in the Gulf Coast are energy and related service industries, military and government-related facilities, educational and medical complexes, petrochemical industries, port facility activities and transportation and related industries, tourism and related service industries, and the gaming industry. As a result of stress in the energy sector, we are working to reduce our overall concentration in that industry while continuing to grow in other areas, creating a more diversified portfolio. 

Our priorities are growing core revenue in our existing markets, controlling expenses, and managing through the challenges of today&#146;s energy cycle. We have invested in promoting new and enhanced products that contribute to the goal of diversifying our sources of revenue and increasing core deposit funding. We will continue to evaluate future acquisition opportunities that have the potential to increase shareholder value, provided overall economic conditions and our capital levels support such a transaction. We remain focused on maintaining two hallmarks of our past culture: a strong balance sheet and a commitment to excellent credit quality.

Loan Production, Underwriting Standards and Credit Review 

The Bank&#146;s primary lending focus is to provide commercial, consumer and real estate loans to consumers, to small and middle market businesses, and to corporate clients in the markets served by the Bank. We seek to provide quality loan products that are attractive to the borrower and profitable to the Bank and to corporate clients that may have a broader service area. We look to build strong, profitable client relationships over time and maintain a strong presence and position of influence in the communities we serve. Through our relationship-based approach we have developed a deep knowledge of our customers and the markets in which they operate. The Company continually works to improve the consistency of its lending processes across our banking footprint, to strengthen the underwriting criteria we employ to evaluate new loans and loan renewals, and to diversify our loan portfolio in terms of type, industry and geographical concentration. We believe that these measures better position the Bank to meet the credit needs of businesses and consumers in the markets it serves while it pursues a balanced strategy of loan profitability, loan growth and loan quality. 

The following describes the underwriting procedures of the lending function and presents our principal categories of loans. The results of our lending activities and the relative risk of the loan portfolio are discussed in &#147;Item 7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#148; 

The Bank has a set of loan policies, underwriting standards and key underwriting functions designed to achieve a consistent approach. Our underwriting standards address: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; collateral requirements; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; guarantor requirements (including policies on financial statements, tax returns, and guarantees); 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; requirements regarding appraisals and their review; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; loan approval hierarchy; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; standard consumer and small business credit scoring underwriting criteria (including credit score thresholds, maximum maturity and amortization, loan-to-value limits, global debt service coverage, and debt to income limits); 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; commercial real estate and commercial and industrial underwriting guidelines (including minimum debt service coverage ratio, maximum amortization, minimum equity requirements, maximum loan-to-value ratios); 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; lending limits; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; credit approval authorities. 

Additionally, we consistently monitor our loan concentration policy to review limits and manage our exposures within specified concentration tolerances, including those to particular borrowers, foreign entities, industries, and property types for commercial real estate. This policy calls for portfolio risk management and reporting, the monitoring of large borrower concentration limits and systematic tracking of large commercial loans and our portfolio mix. We continually monitor our concentration of commercial real estate and energy-related loans to ensure the mix is consistent with our risk tolerance. The Company defines concentration as the total of funded and unfunded commitments (excluding loans acquired in the People&#146;s First transaction covered under loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC) as a percentage of total Bank capital (as defined for risk-based capital ratios). The Company had the following commercial portfolio segment concentrations (shown as a percentage of risk-based capital) as of December 31, 2015: 

Commercial Portfolio Segment Concentrations 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Commercial and Industrial &#151; 494% 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Owner Occupied Real Estate &#151; 112% 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Non-owner occupied commercial real estate (CRE) &#151; 150% 

The following details the more significant industry concentrations included above (shown as a percentage of risk-based capital) as of December 31, 2015:

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Professional, Scientific, and Technology Services &#151; 25% 

Our underwriting process is structured to require oversight that is proportional to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. We delegate designated regional managers, relationship managers, and credit officers loan authority that can be utilized to approve credit commitments for a single borrowing relationship. The limit of delegated authority is based upon the experience, skill, and training of the relationship manager or credit officer. Certain types and size of loans and relationships must be approved by either one of the Bank&#146;s centralized underwriting units or the Bank&#146;s executive loan committee. 

&#160; 

Loans are underwritten in accordance with the underwriting standards and loan policies of the Bank. Loans are underwritten primarily on the basis of the borrower&#146;s ability to make debt service payments timely, and secondarily on collateral value. Generally, real estate secured loans and mortgage loans are made when the borrower produces evidence of the ability to make debt service timely along with appropriate equity investment in the property. Appropriate and regulatory compliant third party valuations are required at the time of origination for real estate secured loans. 

Loan portfolio data is presented as either originated, acquired, or FDIC acquired loans because these segments use different accounting and allowance methodologies. Within these categories, we have commercial, residential mortgage and consumer loans. Loans reported as &#147;originated&#148; include both loans originated for investment and acquired-performing loans where the discount (premium) has been fully amortized (accreted). Loans reported as &#147;acquired&#148; are those purchased in the Whitney acquisition on June 4, 2011. Loans reported as &#147;FDIC acquired&#148; are those purchased in the December 2009 acquisition of Peoples First, and are covered by loss share agreements between the FDIC and the Company for a stipulated period during which the Company is afforded significant protection against loan losses. The loss share agreement on the non-single family portfolio expired on December 31, 2014 and the loss share agreement on the single family portfolio expires on December 31, 2019. 

Commercial 

The Bank offers a variety of commercial loan services to a diversified customer base over a range of industries, including energy, wholesale and retail trade in various durable and nondurable products, manufacturing of such products, marine transportation and maritime construction, financial and professional services, healthcare services, and agricultural production. Commercial loans are categorized as commercial non-real estate, construction and land development, and commercial real estate loans. 

Commercial non-real estate loans, both secured and unsecured, are made available to businesses for working capital (including financing of inventory and receivables), business expansion, and the purchase of equipment and machinery, including equipment leasing. These loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and, if secured, on the underlying collateral. Most commercial non-real estate loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal or corporate guarantee; however, some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis, including a small portfolio of corporate credit cards, generally issued as a part of overall customer relationships. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. 

The commercial non-real estate loan portfolio includes the majority of our energy-based lending, totaling $1.6 billion, or 10%, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015. The Company&#146;s energy portfolio is diversified across a number of industries, including exploration and production as well as related support services. Industry conditions reflect elevated risk, so we are actively monitoring the health of this segment of the portfolio and working towards reducing overall concentration. 

The Bank makes construction and land development loans to builders and real estate developers for the acquisition, development and construction of business and residential-purpose properties. Acquisition and development loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis of real estate absorption and lease rates, and financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Construction loans are generally based upon cost estimates, the amount of sponsor equity investment, and the projected value of the completed project. The Bank monitors the construction process to mitigate or identify risks as they arise. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment largely dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of construction loans may be pre-committed permanent loans from approved long-term lenders, sales of developed property, or an interim loan commitment from the Bank until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are typically closely 

&#160; 

monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions, and the availability of long-term financing to take out the construction loan. The Bank also makes owner occupied loans for the acquisition, development and improvements of real property to commercial customers to be used in their business operations. These loans are underwritten subject to normal commercial and industrial credit standards and are generally subject to project tracking processes, similar to those required for the non-owner occupied loans. 

Commercial real estate loans consist of commercial mortgages on both income-producing and owner-occupied properties. Over the course of the past few years, we have executed a strategy to increase the proportion of loans secured by owner-occupied properties and reduce reliance on speculative real estate projects. Loans secured by income-producing properties are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and undergo the analysis and underwriting process of a commercial and industrial loan, as well as that of a real estate loan. Repayment of non-owner occupied loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the income-producing property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing the Bank&#146;s commercial real estate portfolios are diverse in terms of type and geographic location. We monitor and evaluate commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. Many of the markets within the footprint have shown signs of stability in values over the past 12 months. However, past experience has shown that commercial real estate conditions can be volatile, so we actively monitor this segment of the portfolio. 

Residential Mortgage 

A portion of the Bank&#146;s lending activities consists of the origination of both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate home loans, although we sell most longer term fixed-rate loans that we originate in the secondary mortgage market on a best-efforts basis. The sale of fixed-rate mortgage loans allows the Bank to manage the interest rate risks related to such lending operations. 

Consumer 

Consumer loans include second mortgage home loans, home equity lines of credit and non-residential consumer purpose loans. Non-residential consumer loans include both direct and indirect loans. Direct non-residential consumer loans are made to finance the purchase of personal property, including automobiles, recreational vehicles and boats, and for other personal purposes (secured and unsecured), and deposit account secured loans. An indirect non-residential loan is automobile financing provided to the consumer through an agreement with automobile dealerships. Consumer loans are attractive because they typically are relatively low balance loans with shorter maturities and produce a higher overall yield. The Bank also has a small portfolio of credit card receivables issued on the basis of applications received through referrals from the Bank&#146;s branches and other marketing efforts. The Bank approves consumer loans based on income and financial information submitted by prospective borrowers as well as credit reports collected from various credit agencies. Financial stability and credit history of the borrower are the primary factors the Bank considers in granting such loans. The availability of collateral is also a factor considered in making such loans. Preference is also given to borrowers in the Bank&#146;s primary market areas. 

A small consumer finance portfolio is maintained by Harrison Finance Company, one of our nonbank subsidiaries. The portfolio has a higher credit risk profile than the Bank&#146;s consumer portfolio, but carries a higher yield. 

Securities Portfolio 

Our investment portfolio primarily consists of U.S. agency debt securities, U.S. agency mortgage-related securities and obligations of states and municipalities classified as available for sale and held to maturity. The 

&#160; 

Company considers the available for sale portfolio as one of its many sources of liquidity available to fund our operations. Investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by the Board Risk Committee. The investment portfolio is tested under multiple stressed interest rate scenarios, the results of which are used to manage our interest rate risk position. The rate scenarios include regulatory and management agreed upon instantaneous and ramped rate movements that may be up to plus 500 basis points. The combined portfolio has a target effective duration of two to five. The effective duration provides a measure of the Company&#146;s portfolio price sensitivity to a 100 basis point change in interest rates. 

We also utilize a significant portion of the securities portfolio to secure certain deposits and other liabilities requiring collateralization. However, to maintain an adequate level of liquidity, we limit the percentage of securities that can be pledged in order to keep a portion of securities available for sale. The securities portfolio can also be pledged to increase our line of credit availability at the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Dallas, although we have not had to do so. 

The investments subcommittee of the asset/liability committee (ALCO) is responsible for oversight and monitoring and the management of the investment portfolio. The investments subcommittee is also responsible for the development of investment strategies for the consideration and approval of ALCO. Final authority and responsibility for all aspects of the conduct of investment activities rests with the Board Risk Committee, all in accordance with the overall guidance and limitations of the investment policy. See &#147;Item 7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Enterprise Risk Management&#148; for further discussion. 

Deposits 

The Bank has several programs designed to attract deposit accounts from consumers and businesses at interest rates generally consistent with market conditions. Deposits are the most significant funding source for the Company&#146;s interest-earning assets. Deposits are attracted principally from clients within our retail branch network through the offering of a broad array of deposit products to individuals and businesses, including noninterest-bearing demand deposit accounts, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, and time deposit accounts. Terms vary among deposit products with respect to commitment periods, minimum balances, and applicable fees. Interest paid on deposits represents the largest component of our interest expense. Interest rates offered on interest-bearing deposits are determined based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, (1) interest rates offered in local markets by competitors, (2) current and expected economic conditions, (3) anticipated future interest rates, (4) the expected amount and timing of funding needs, and (5) the availability and cost of alternative funding sources. Deposit flows are controlled by the Bank primarily through pricing, and to a lesser extent, through promotional activities. Management believes that the rates that it offers on deposit accounts are generally competitive with other financial institutions in the Bank&#146;s respective market areas. Client deposits are attractive sources of funding because of their stability and low relative cost. Deposits are regarded as an important part of the overall client relationship and provide opportunities to cross-sell other bank services. 

The Bank also holds deposits of public entities. The Bank&#146;s strategy for acquiring public funds, as with any type of deposit, is determined by ALCO&#146;s funding and liquidity subcommittee while pricing decisions are determined by ALCO&#146;s deposit pricing subcommittee. Typically, many public fund deposits are allocated based upon the rate of interest offered and the ability of a bank to provide collateralization. The Bank can influence the level of its public fund deposits through pricing decisions. Public deposits typically require the pledging of collateral, most commonly marketable securities. This is taken into account when determining the level of interest to be paid on public deposits. The pledging of collateral, monitoring and management reporting represents additional operational requirements for the Bank. Public fund deposits are more volatile because they tend to be price sensitive and have high balances. Public funds are only one of many possible sources of liquidity that the Bank has available to draw upon as part of its liquidity funding strategy as set by ALCO. 

&#160; 

Total deposits at December 31, 2015 included $361 million of brokered deposits, or less than 2% of total deposits. Brokered deposits represent funds which the Bank obtains through deposit brokers who sell participations in a given bank deposit account or instrument to one or more investors. These brokered deposits are fully insured by the FDIC because they are participated out by the deposit broker in shares of $250,000 or less. These brokered deposits issuances were approved by ALCO as one component of its funding strategy to support ongoing asset growth until such time as customer deposit growth ultimately replaces the brokered deposits. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#147;FDICIA&#148;), we may continue to accept brokered deposits as long as we are either &#147;well-capitalized&#148; or &#147;adequately-capitalized&#148;. 

Trust Services 

The Bank, through its trust department, offers a full range of trust services on a fee basis. In its trust capacities, the Bank provides investment management services on an agency basis and acts as trustee for pension plans, profit sharing plans, corporate and municipal bond issues, living trusts, life insurance trusts and various other types of trusts created by or for individuals, businesses, and charitable and religious organizations. As of December 31, 2015, the trust departments of the Bank had approximately $15.5 billion of assets under administration compared to $15.3 billion as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, administered assets include investment management and investment advisory agency accounts totaling $4.3 billion, corporate trust accounts totaling $5.0 billion, and the remaining balances were personal, employee benefit, estate and other trust accounts. 

COMPETITION 

The financial services industry is highly competitive in our market area. The principal competitive factors in the markets for deposits and loans are interest rates and fee structures associated with the various products offered. We also compete through the efficiency, quality, and range of services and products we provide, as well as the convenience provided by an extensive network of customer access channels including local branch offices, ATMs, online and mobile banking, and telebanking centers. In attracting deposits and in our lending activities, we generally compete with other commercial banks, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies, and other financial institutions.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

The Company is subject to extensive regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#147;Federal Reserve&#148;) pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#147;Bank Holding Company Act&#148;). In addition to regulation by the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation by the State of Mississippi under its general business corporation laws. The Company is also required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of, the SEC under federal securities laws. 

&#160; 

Federal Regulation 

The Company is registered with the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company and has elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act. As such, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. 

The Bank Holding Company Act generally prohibits a corporation that owns a federally insured financial institution (&#147;bank&#148;) from engaging in activities other than banking and managing or controlling banks or other subsidiaries engaging in permissible activities. Also prohibited is acquiring or obtaining control of more than 5% of the voting interests of any company that engages in activities other than those activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto. In determining whether a particular activity is permissible, the Federal Reserve is also required to consider whether the performance of the activity can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public that outweigh possible adverse effects. Examples of activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be permissible are making, acquiring or servicing loans; leasing personal property; providing certain investment or financial advice; performing certain data processing services; acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and all insurance in certain locations; and performing certain insurance underwriting activities. The Bank Holding Company Act does not place territorial limits on permissible bank-related activities of bank holding companies. Even with respect to permissible activities, however, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or its control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or control of such subsidiary would pose a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company. 

The Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve or waiver of such prior approval before it: (1) acquires ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, such bank holding company will own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank, (2) or any of its non-bank subsidiaries acquire all of the assets of a bank, (3) merges with any other bank holding company, or (4) engages in permissible non-banking activities. In reviewing a proposed covered acquisition, the Federal Reserve considers a bank holding company&#146;s financial, managerial and competitive posture, the future prospects of the companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve also reviews any indebtedness to be incurred by a bank holding company in connection with the proposed acquisition to ensure that the bank holding company can service such indebtedness without adversely affecting its ability, and the ability of its subsidiaries, to meet their respective regulatory capital requirements. The Bank Holding Company Act further requires that consummation of approved bank holding company or bank acquisitions or mergers must be delayed for a period of not less than 15 or more than 30 days following the date of Federal Reserve approval. During such 15 to 30-day period, the Department of Justice has the right to review the competitive aspects of the proposed transaction. The Department of Justice may file a lawsuit with the relevant United States Court of Appeals seeking an injunction against the proposed acquisition. 

The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the &#147;Riegle-Neal Act&#148;) permits adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies to acquire control of banks in any state, subject to federal regulatory approval, without regard to whether such a transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state. However, the Riegle-Neal Act further provides that a bank holding company may not, following an interstate acquisition, control more than 10% of nationwide insured deposits or 30% of deposits within any state in which the acquiring bank operates. States have the right to lower the 30% limit, although no states within the Company&#146;s current market area have done so. Additional provisions of Riegle-Neal require that interstate activities conform to the Community Reinvestment Act, which is intended to encourage depository institutions to help address the credit needs of the communities in which they operate, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;) authorizes national and state banks to establish de novo branches in other states to the same extent a bank chartered in those states would be so permitted. 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the &#147;Financial Services Modernization Act&#148;) established a comprehensive framework that permits affiliations among qualified bank holding companies, commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms, and other financial service providers by revising and expanding the Bank Holding Company Act framework to permit a holding company to engage in a full range of financial activities through a financial holding company. 

Capital Requirements 

General Risk-Based and Leverage-Based Capital Requirements 

The Federal Reserve has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for use in its examination and regulation of bank holding companies and financial holding companies. The regulatory capital of a bank holding company or financial holding company under applicable federal capital adequacy guidelines is particularly important in the Federal Reserve&#146;s evaluation of the overall safety and soundness of a bank holding company or financial holding company and is an important factor considered by the Federal Reserve in evaluating any applications made by such holding company to the Federal Reserve. If regulatory capital falls below minimum guideline levels, a financial holding company may lose its status as a financial holding company and a bank holding company or bank may be subject to dividend restrictions or denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses or to open additional facilities. 

Additionally, each bank subsidiary of a financial holding company as well as the holding company itself must be well capitalized and well managed as determined by the subsidiary bank&#146;s principal federal regulator, which in the case of the Bank, is the FDIC. To be considered well managed, the bank and holding company must have received at least a satisfactory composite rating and a satisfactory management rating at its most recent examination. The Federal Reserve rates bank holding companies through a confidential component and composite 1-5 rating system, with a composite rating of 1 being the highest rating and 5 being the lowest. This system is designed to help identify institutions requiring special attention. Financial institutions are assigned ratings based on evaluation and rating of their financial condition and operations. Components reviewed include capital adequacy, asset quality, management capability, the quality and level of earnings, the adequacy of liquidity and sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations. As of December 31, 2015, the Company and the Bank were both well capitalized. 

A financial holding company that becomes aware that it or a subsidiary bank has ceased to be well capitalized or well managed must notify the Federal Reserve and enter into an agreement to cure the identified deficiency within a specified time period. If the deficiency is not cured timely, the Federal Reserve Board may order the financial holding company to divest its banking operations. Alternatively, to avoid divestiture, a financial holding company may cease to engage in the financial holding company activities that are unrelated to banking or otherwise impermissible for a bank holding company. 

There are two measures of regulatory capital applicable to holding companies (1) leverage capital ratio and (2) risk-based capital ratios. Beginning January 1, 2015, the Company&#146;s and the Bank&#146;s primary federal regulators&#151;the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, respectively&#151;adopted final rules implementing the Basel III framework, which substantially revised the leverage and risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions. These final rules were based on international capital accords of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#147;Basel Committee&#148;). The final rules established a new category of capital measure, Common Equity Tier 1 capital. Additionally, the final rules introduced a capital conservation buffer with respect to each of the Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk-based and Total Risk-based capital ratios, which provides for capital levels that exceed the minimum risk-based capital requirements. The 

&#160; 

capital conservation buffer must be maintained by the holding company to avoid limitations on its capital distributions and on its ability to pay discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in beginning in 2016, with full implementation to 2.50% by 2019. 

The essential difference between the leverage capital ratio and the risk-based capital ratios is that the latter measures capital against both balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks that are both identified and risk-weighted. Common Equity Tier 1 capital is predominantly comprised of common stock instruments (including related surplus) and retained earnings, net of treasury stock, and after making required capital deductions and adjustments. Tier 1 capital generally is limited to all Common Equity Tier 1 capital plus qualifying minority interests (issued by consolidated depository institutions or foreign bank subsidiaries), accounts of consolidated subsidiaries and an amount of qualifying perpetual preferred stock, limited to 50% of Tier 1 capital. In calculating Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 capital, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and goodwill are deducted from Tier 1 capital. Additionally, there are deductions and adjustments to capital for other intangibles as well as deductions and adjustments to capital by the amount that the carrying value of certain assets exceeds 10% of capital. Examples of these assets are deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing rights, significant investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, investments in certain capital instruments of financial entities and unrealized gains on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income (&#147;AOCI&#148;) arising from hedges not carried at fair market value on the balance sheet. Tier 2 capital is a secondary component of risk-based capital, consisting primarily of that portion of perpetual preferred stock that may not be included as Tier 1 capital, mandatory convertible securities, certain types of subordinated debt and a portion of the allowance for loan losses (limited to 1.25% of risk weighted assets). 

The risk-based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies, to take into account off-balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Under the risk-based capital guidelines, assets are assigned to one of several risk categories, ranging from 0% to 1,250%, though Hancock does not have any assets assigned to a risk category over 150%. For example, U.S. Treasury securities are assigned to the 0% risk category while most categories of loans are assigned to the 100% risk category. Off-balance sheet exposures such as standby letters of credit are risk-weighted and all or a portion thereof are included in risk-weighted assets based on an assessment of the relative risks that they present. The risk-weighted asset base is equal to the sum of the aggregate dollar values of assets and off-balance sheet items in each risk category, multiplied by the weight assigned to that category. 

The new rules also gave some banks, including ours, a one-time &#147;opt out&#148; in which banks could exclude certain volatile AOCI components from inclusion in regulatory capital. The Bank exercised its AOCI opt-out election option on the Bank&#146;s Call Report and the Company&#146;s FR Y-9C filed as of March 31, 2015. 

The Company&#146;s leverage capital ratio and risk based capital ratios as of December 31, 2015 were as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Minimum Capital Plus Capital Conservation Buffer &#160; &#160; Company at 12/31/2015 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Minimum &#160; &#160; Well-Capitalized &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; &#160; 2017 &#160; &#160; 2018 &#160; &#160; 2019 &#160; &#160; Tier 1 leverage capital ratio

&#160; &#160; 8.00 % &#160; &#160; 10.00 % &#160; &#160; 8.625 % &#160; &#160; 9.25 % &#160; &#160; 9.875 % &#160; &#160; 10.50 % &#160; &#160; 11.86 % &#160; 

Federal Reserve Oversight 

The Company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the Company&#146;s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a transaction if it determines that the proposed redemption or stock purchase would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or directive or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. 

The Federal Reserve has issued &#147;Policy Statement on Cash Dividends Not Fully Covered by Earnings&#148; (the &#147;Policy Statement&#148;) which sets forth various guidelines that the Federal Reserve believes a bank holding company should follow in establishing its dividend policy. In general, the Federal Reserve stated that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings. The Federal Reserve also stated that dividends should not be paid unless the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. 

The Company is required to file annual and quarterly reports with the Federal Reserve and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act. The Federal Reserve may examine a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries. 

Additional Federal Regulatory Issues 

In June 2010, the federal banking agencies issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization&#146;s incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires those agencies, along with the Commission, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. The federal banking agencies and the Commission proposed such rules in April 2011. In addition, in June 2012, the Commission issued final rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act&#146;s requirement that the Commission direct the national securities exchanges to adopt certain listing standards related to the compensation committee of a company&#146;s board of directors as well as its compensation advisers. 

The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. There are various restrictions that limit the ability of the Bank to finance, pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to the Company or other affiliates. In addition, subsidiary banks of holding companies are subject to certain restrictions under Section 23A and B of the Federal Reserve Act on any extension of credit to the bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries, on investments in the stock or other securities thereof and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. Further, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with extensions of credit, leases or sales of property, or furnishing of services. 

Stress Testing 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires stress testing of bank holding companies and banks, such as the Company and the Bank, that have more than $10 billion but less than $50 billion of consolidated assets (&#147;medium-sized companies&#148;). Additional stress testing is required for banking organizations having $50 billion or more of assets. Medium-sized companies, including the Company and the Bank, are required to conduct annual, company-run stress tests under rules the federal bank regulatory agencies issued in October 2012. 

Stress tests analyze the potential impact of scenarios on the consolidated earnings, balance sheet and capital of a bank holding company or depository institutions over a designated planning horizon of nine quarters, taking into account the organization&#146;s current condition, risks, exposures, strategies, and activities, and such factors as the 

&#160; 

regulators may request of a specific organization. These are tested against baseline, adverse, and severely adverse economic scenarios specified by the Federal Reserve for the Company and by the FDIC for the Bank. 

Each banking organization&#146;s board of directors and senior management are required to approve and review the policies and procedures of their stress-testing processes as frequently as economic conditions or the condition of the organization may warrant, and at least annually. They are also required to consider the results of the stress test in the normal course of business, including the banking organization&#146;s capital planning (including dividends and share buybacks), assessment of capital adequacy and maintaining capital consistent with its risks, and risk management practices. The results of the stress tests are provided to the applicable federal banking agencies. Public disclosure of stress test results began on June 23, 2015. 

Bank Regulation 

The operation of the Bank is subject to state and federal statutes applicable to state banks and the regulations of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#147;CFPB&#148;). The operations of the Bank may also be subject to applicable Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#147;OCC&#148;) regulation to the extent state banks are granted parity with national banks. Such statutes and regulations relate to, among other things, required reserves, investments, loans, mergers and consolidations, issuances of securities, payments of dividends, establishment of branches, consumer protection and other aspects of the Bank&#146;s operations. 

The Bank is subject to regulation and periodic examinations by the CFPB, FDIC and the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance (the &#147;MDBCF&#148;). These regulatory authorities routinely examine the Bank&#146;s reserves, loan and investment quality, consumer compliance, management policies, procedures and practices and other aspects of operations. These examinations are designed to protect the Bank&#146;s depositors, rather than the Company&#146;s shareholders. In addition to these regular examinations, the Company and the Bank must furnish periodic reports to their respective regulatory authorities containing a full and accurate statement of their affairs. 

The Dodd-Frank Act has removed many limitations on the Federal Reserve&#146;s authority to examine banks that are subsidiaries of bank holding companies. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve is generally permitted to examine bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, provided that the Federal Reserve must rely on reports submitted directly by the institution and examination reports of the appropriate regulators (such as the FDIC and the MDBCF) to the fullest extent possible; must provide reasonable notice to, and consult with, the appropriate regulators before commencing an examination of a bank holding company subsidiary; and, to the fullest extent possible, must avoid duplication of examination activities, reporting requirements, and requests for information. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also established the CFPB. The CFPB is funded by the Federal Reserve and, in consultation with the Federal banking agencies, makes rules relating to consumer protection. The CFPB has the authority, should it wish to do so, to rewrite virtually all of the consumer protection regulations governing banks, including those implementing the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (&#147;RESPA&#148;), the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (except Sections 615(e) and 628), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (sections 502 through 509 relating to privacy), among others. The Bank is subject to direct supervision and examination by the CFPB in respect of the foregoing consumer protection acts and regulations because the Bank&#146;s total assets are over $10 billion as of December 31, 2015. 

The Bank is a member of the FDIC, and its deposits are insured as provided by law by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the &#147;DIF&#148;). The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits and the Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage is $250,000 per depositor. 

&#160; 

The Bank pays deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC based on an assessment rate that is calculated utilizing a scorecard for banks with more than $10 billion in assets. The scorecard has a performance score and a loss-severity score that are combined to produce a total score. The calculation incorporates the CAMELS ratings as well as forward-looking financial measures to assess the Bank&#146;s ability to withstand both asset-related and funding-related stress. The FDIC has discretion to adjust the total score, up or down, based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard. The total score is then translated to an initial base assessment rate on a sharply-increasing scale. The initial base assessment rate ranges from 5 to 35 basis points on an annualized basis (basis points representing cents per $100). After the effect of potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate could range from 2.5 to 45 basis points on an annualized basis. The assessment rate is applied to the deposit insurance assessment base, which is calculated based on the Bank&#146;s average total assets less average tangible equity during the assessment period. 

The FDIC sets assessment rates to restore the DIF to a minimum ratio of deposit insurance reserves to estimated insured deposits of 1.15% by the end of 2016. The Dodd-Frank Act further requires the FDIC to bring the fund ratio to at least 1.35% by September 30, 2020. The FDIC has indicated it will lower the assessment base rates for all banks beginning in the quarter after the fund reaches the 1.15% level and has proposed to impose a surcharge assessment on banks with total assets of $10 billion or more in order to raise the fund ratio to the required 1.35% level. The ultimate impact on the Bank&#146;s deposit insurance cost from the lower base rates combined with the proposed surcharge assessment will depend on a number of factors, including the final details of its implementation by the FDIC. 

Since the first quarter of 2000, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC have been required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (the &#147;FICO&#148;), a mixed-ownership government corporation established to recapitalize a predecessor to the DIF. The FICO assessment rate is adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment bases of the fund based on quarterly Call Report and Thrift Financial Report submissions. The current annualized assessment rate is 0.600 basis points, or 0.150 basis points per quarter. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017 through 2019. 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the &#147;FDICIA&#148;) subjects banks and bank holding companies to increased regulation and supervision, including a regulatory emphasis that links supervision to bank capital levels. Also, federal banking regulators are required to take prompt regulatory action with respect to depository institutions that fall below specified capital levels and to draft non-capital regulatory measures to assure bank safety. 

FDICIA contains a &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; section intended to address problem institutions at the least possible long-term cost to the DIF. Pursuant to this section, the federal banking agencies are required to prescribe a leverage limit and a risk-based capital requirement indicating levels at which institutions will be deemed to be &#147;well capitalized,&#148; &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148; &#147;undercapitalized,&#148; &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148; or &#147;critically undercapitalized.&#148; In the case of a depository institution that is &#147;critically undercapitalized&#148; (a term defined to include institutions which still have positive net worth), the federal banking regulators are generally required to appoint a conservator or receiver. 

FDICIA further requires regulators to perform annual on-site bank examinations, places limits on real estate lending and tightens audit requirements. The legislation attempted to eliminate the &#147;too big to fail&#148; doctrine, which protects uninsured deposits of large banks and restricts the ability of undercapitalized banks to obtain extended loans from the Federal Reserve Board discount window. FDICIA also imposes disclosure requirements relating to fees charged and interest paid on checking and deposit accounts. 

In addition to regulating capital, the FDIC has broad authority to prevent the development or continuance of unsafe or unsound banking practices. Pursuant to this authority, the FDIC has adopted regulations that restrict preferential loans and loan amounts to &#147;affiliates&#148; and &#147;insiders&#148; of banks, require banks to keep information on loans to major shareholders and executive officers and bar certain director and officer interlocks between 

&#160; 

financial institutions. The FDIC is also authorized to approve mergers, consolidations and assumption of deposit liability transactions between insured banks and between insured banks and uninsured banks or institutions to prevent capital or surplus diminution in such transactions where the resulting, continuing or assumed bank is an insured nonmember state bank. 

Although the Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve, it is subject to Federal Reserve regulations that require the Bank to maintain reserves against transaction accounts (primarily checking accounts). On January 23, 2014, the Federal Reserve regulations were revised to require that reserves be maintained against net transaction accounts in the amount of 3% of the aggregate of such accounts up to $103.6 million, and, if the aggregate of such accounts exceeds that amount, 10% of the total in excess of $103.6 million. This regulation is subject to an exemption from reserve requirement on $14.5 million of an institution&#146;s transaction accounts. 

The Financial Services Modernization Act also permits national banks, and through state parity statutes, state banks, to engage in expanded activities through the formation of financial subsidiaries. A state bank may have a subsidiary engaged in any activity authorized for state banks directly or any financial activity, except for insurance underwriting, insurance investments, real estate investment or development, or merchant banking, each of which may only be conducted through a subsidiary of a financial holding company. Financial activities include all activities permitted under new sections of the Bank Holding Company Act or permitted by regulation. 

A state bank seeking to have a financial subsidiary, and each of its depository institution affiliates, must be &#147;well-capitalized&#148; and &#147;well-managed.&#148; The total assets of all financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of a bank&#146;s total assets, or $50 billion. A state bank must exclude from its assets and equity all equity investments, including retained earnings, in a financial subsidiary. The assets of the financial subsidiary may not be consolidated with the bank&#146;s assets. The bank must also have policies and procedures to assess financial subsidiary risk and protect the bank from such risks and potential liabilities. 

The Financial Services Modernization Act also added a new section of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act governing subsidiaries of state banks that engage in &#147;activities as principal that would only be permissible&#148; for a national bank to conduct in a financial subsidiary. It expressly preserves the ability of a state bank to retain all existing subsidiaries. Because Mississippi permits commercial banks chartered by the state to engage in any activity permissible for national banks, the Bank will be permitted to form subsidiaries to engage in the activities authorized by the Financial Services Modernization Act if it so chooses. In order to form a financial subsidiary, a state bank must be well-capitalized, and the state bank would be subject to the same capital deduction, risk management and affiliate transaction rules as applicable to national banks. 

In 2001, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the &#147;USA Patriot Act&#148;) was signed into law. The USA Patriot Act broadened the application of anti-money laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions, such as broker-dealers, and strengthened the ability of the U.S. government to detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The principal provisions of Title III of the USA Patriot Act require that regulated financial institutions, including banks: (i) establish an anti-money laundering program that includes training and audit components; (ii) comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account; (iii) take additional required precautions with non-U.S. owned accounts; and (iv) perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships. The USA Patriot Act also expanded the conditions under which funds in a U.S. interbank account may be subject to forfeiture and increased the penalties for violation of anti-money laundering regulations. Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA Patriot Act&#146;s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. The Bank has adopted policies, procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act under the existing regulations and will continue to revise and update its policies, procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the USA Patriot Act and implementing regulations. 

&#160; 

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#147;OFAC&#148;) is an office in the U.S. Department of the Treasury responsible for helping to ensure U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with &#147;enemies&#148; of the United States. OFAC publishes a list of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts; owned or controlled by, or acting on behalf of target countries, and narcotics traffickers. If a bank finds a name on any transaction, account, or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze or block the transactions on the account. The Bank actively checks high-risk OFAC areas such as new accounts, wire transfers and customer files. 

Other Regulatory Matters 

Risk-retention rules . Banks that sponsor the securitization of asset-backed securities and residential-mortgage backed securities are required to retain 5% of any loan they sell or securitize, except for mortgages that meet low-risk standards. 

Limitation on federal preemption . Limitations have been imposed on the ability of national bank regulators to preempt state law. Formerly, the national bank and federal thrift regulators possessed preemption powers with regard to transactions, operating subsidiaries and general civil enforcement authority. These preemption requirements have been limited by the Dodd-Frank Act, which will likely impact state banks by limiting the future scope of approval of activities that would otherwise be subject to the approval of the OCC. 

Changes to regulation of bank holding companies . Under the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and well-managed to engage in interstate transactions. In the past, only the subsidiary banks were required to meet those standards. The Federal Reserve Board&#146;s &#147;source of strength doctrine&#148; has now been codified, mandating that bank holding companies such as the Company serve as a source of strength for their subsidiary banks, such that the bank holding company must be able to provide financial assistance in the event the subsidiary bank experiences financial distress. 

Mortgage Rules. Pursuant to rules adopted by the CFPB, banks that make residential mortgage loans are required to make a good faith determination that a borrower has the ability to repay a mortgage loan prior to extending such credit, require that certain mortgage loans contain escrow payments, obtain new appraisals under certain circumstances, and follow specific rules regarding the compensation of loan originators and the servicing of residential mortgage loans. The implementation of these new rules began in January 2014. 

Volcker Rule. In December 2013, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the OCC, the Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued the &#147;Prohibitions And Restrictions On Proprietary Trading And Certain Interests In, And Relationships With, Hedge Funds And Private Equity Funds,&#148; commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule, which regulates and restricts investments which may be made by banks. The Volcker Rule was adopted to implement a portion of the Dodd-Frank Act and new Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act, which prohibits any banking entity from engaging in proprietary trading or from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in, or sponsoring or having certain relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund (&#147;covered funds&#148;), subject to certain exemptions. 

Debit Interchange Fees 

Interchange fees, or &#147;swipe&#148; fees, are fees that merchants pay to credit card companies and card-issuing banks such as the Bank for processing electronic payment transactions on their behalf. The maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction, subject to an upward adjustment of 1 cent if an issuer certifies that it has implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the fraud-prevention standards set forth by the Federal Reserve. 

&#160; 

In addition, the legislation prohibits card issuers and networks from entering into exclusive arrangements requiring that debit card transactions be processed on a single network or only two affiliated networks, and allows merchants to determine transaction routing. The Federal Reserve rule limiting debit interchange fees has significantly reduced the Bank&#146;s debit card interchange revenues beginning third quarter of 2012. 

Nonbanking Subsidiaries 

The Company&#146;s and Bank&#146;s nonbanking subsidiaries are also subject to a variety of state and federal laws. For example, Hancock Insurance Agency is subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the states in which it is active; Hancock Investment Services, Inc. is subject to supervision and regulation by the SEC and the State of Mississippi; and Harrison Finance Company is regulated by the State of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance. 

Summary 

The foregoing is a brief summary of certain statutes, rules and regulations affecting the Company and the Bank. It is not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all statutes and regulations having an impact on the operations of such entities. 

Increased regulation generally has resulted in increased legal and compliance expense. 

Finally, additional bills may be introduced in the future in the U.S. Congress and state legislatures to alter the structure, regulation and competitive relationships of financial institutions. It cannot be predicted whether and in what form any of these proposals will be adopted or the extent to which the business of the Company and the Bank may be affected thereby. 

Effect of Governmental Monetary and Fiscal Policies 

The difference between the interest rate paid on deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate received on loans and securities comprises most of a bank&#146;s earnings. In order to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in the industry, the banking business is becoming increasingly dependent on the generation of fee and service charge revenue. 

The earnings and growth of a bank will be affected by both general economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policy of the U.S. government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve sets national monetary policy such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession. This is accomplished by its open-market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments in the amount of reserves that financial institutions are required to maintain and adjustments to the discount rates on borrowings and target rates for federal funds transactions. The actions of the Federal Reserve in these areas influence the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and also affect interest rates on loans and deposits. The nature and timing of any future changes in monetary policies and their potential impact on the Company cannot be predicted.
