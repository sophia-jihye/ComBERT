c. Narrative description of business 

&#9642; 

General 

The Company operates and franchises McDonald&#8217;s restaurants, which serve a locally-relevant menu of quality food and drinks sold at various price points in more than 100 countries. McDonald&#8217;s global system is comprised of both Company-owned and franchised restaurants. McDonald&#8217;s franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures - conventional franchise, developmental license or affiliate. The optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant, trading area or market (country) is based on a variety of factors, including the availability of individuals with the entrepreneurial experience and financial resources, as well as the local legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property ownership and franchising. We continually review our mix of Company-owned and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be 95% franchised over the long term. The business relationship between McDonald&#8217;s and its independent franchisees is of fundamental importance to overall performance and to the McDonald&#8217;s Brand. This business relationship is supported by an agreement that requires adherence to standards and policies essential to protecting our brand. 

The Company is primarily a franchisor, with more than 80% of McDonald's restaurants owned and operated by independent franchisees. Franchising enables an individual to own a restaurant business and maintain control over staffing, purchasing, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of McDonald&#8217;s global brand, operating system and financial resources. One of the strengths of this model is that the expertise gained from operating Company-owned restaurants allows McDonald&#8217;s to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and, when viable, efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants. 

Directly operating McDonald&#8217;s restaurants contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor. Having Company-owned restaurants provides Company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience. In addition, in our Company-owned and operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we are able to further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit relevant McDonald&#8217;s restaurants. 

&#160;

Under a conventional franchise arrangement, the Company owns the land and building or secures a long-term lease for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment, signs, seating and d&#233;cor. The Company believes that ownership of real estate, combined with the co-investment by franchisees, enables us to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. 

Franchisees are also responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time. In addition, to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives, the Company frequently co-invests with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or their operating systems. These investments, developed with input from McDonald&#8217;s with the aim of improving local business performance, increase the value of our Brand through the development of modernized, more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants. 

The Company&#8217;s typical franchise term is 20 years. The Company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors. The business relationship with franchisees is designed to assure consistency and high quality at all McDonald&#8217;s restaurants. Conventional franchisees contribute to the Company&#8217;s revenue through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees paid upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new franchise. This structure enables McDonald&#8217;s to generate significant levels of cash flow. 

Under a developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest. The Company does not invest any capital under a developmental license arrangement. The Company receives a royalty based upon a percent of sales as well as initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license. We use the developmental license ownership structure in over 70 countries with a total of approximately 5,500 &#32;restaurants. The largest developmental licensee operates approximately 2,100 &#32;restaurants in 19 &#32;countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. 

Finally, the Company also has an equity investment in a limited number of foreign affiliated markets, referred to as &#8220;affiliates.&#8221; In these markets, the Company receives a royalty based on a percent of sales and records its share of net results in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. The largest of these affiliates is Japan, where there are nearly 3,000 restaurants. 

&#9642; 

Supply Chain and Quality Assurance 

The Company and its franchisees purchase food, packaging, equipment and other goods from numerous independent suppliers. The Company has established and enforces high quality standards and product specifications. The Company has quality centers around the world designed to ensure that its high standards are consistently met. The quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews, but also on-site supplier visits. A Food Safety Advisory Council, composed of the Company&#8217;s technical, safety and supply chain specialists, as well as suppliers and outside academia, provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food safety. In addition, the Company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation, assure best practices and drive continuous improvement. Leveraging scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies, the Company also collaborates with suppliers toward a goal of achieving competitive, predictable food and paper costs over the long term. 

Independently owned and operated distribution centers, approved by the Company, distribute products and supplies to McDonald&#8217;s restaurants. In addition, restaurant personnel are trained in the proper storage, handling and preparation of products.

&#9642; 

Working capital practices 

Information about the Company&#8217;s working capital practices is incorporated herein by reference to Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 &#32;in Part II, Item 7, pages 13 through 28, and the Consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 &#32;in Part II, Item 8, page 33 of this Form 10-K. 

&#9642; 

Customers 

The Company&#8217;s business is not dependent upon either a single customer or small group of customers. 

&#9642; 

Backlog 

Company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders. 

&#9642; 

Government contracts 

No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at government election. 

&#9642; 

Competition 

McDonald&#8217;s restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of food products. The Company competes on the basis of price, convenience, service, menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry. 

&#160;

In measuring the Company&#8217;s competitive position, management reviews data compiled by Euromonitor International, a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry. The Company&#8217;s primary competition, which is referred to as the informal eating out ("IEO") segment, includes the following restaurant categories defined by Euromonitor International: quick-service eating establishments, casual dining full-service restaurants, street stalls or kiosks, caf&#233;s,100% home delivery/takeaway providers, specialist coffee shops, self-service cafeterias and juice/smoothie bars. The IEO segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and full-service restaurants other than casual dining. 

Based on data from Euromonitor International, the global IEO segment was composed of approximately 8 million &#32;outlets and generated $1.2 trillion &#32;in annual sales in 2014 , the most recent year for which data is available. McDonald&#8217;s Systemwide 2014 &#32;restaurant business accounted for 0.5% &#32;of those outlets and 7.2% &#32;of the sales. 

Management also on occasion benchmarks McDonald&#8217;s against the entire restaurant industry, including the IEO segment defined above and all other full-service restaurants. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 17 million &#32;outlets and generated $2.4 trillion &#32;in annual sales in 2014 . McDonald&#8217;s Systemwide restaurant business accounted for 0.2% &#32;of those outlets and 3.6% &#32;of the sales. 

&#9642; 

Research and development 

The Company operates research and development facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. While research and development activities are important to the Company&#8217;s business, these expenditures are not material. Independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the "System"). 

&#9642; 

Environmental matters 

The Company continuously endeavors to improve its social responsibility and environmental practices to achieve long-term sustainability, which benefits McDonald&#8217;s and the communities it serves. 

Increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives, particularly in the area of climate change. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. Although the impact would likely vary by world region and/or market, we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs for the Company. Also, there is a possibility that governmental initiatives, or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns, climate, or water resources could have a direct impact on the operations of the System in ways which we cannot predict at this time. 

The Company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner. At this time, the Company has already begun to undertake its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment, including the implementation of more energy efficient equipment and management of energy use and more sustainable sourcing practices in many of its markets.
