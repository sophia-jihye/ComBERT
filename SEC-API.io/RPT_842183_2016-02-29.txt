 

Business Objectives, Strategies and Significant Transactions 

Our business objective is to own and manage high quality shopping centers that generate cash flow for distribution to our shareholders and that have the potential for capital appreciation. To achieve this objective, we seek to acquire, develop, or redevelop shopping centers that meet our investment criteria. We also seek to recycle capital through the sale of land or shopping centers that we deem to be fully valued or that no longer meet our investment criteria. We use debt to finance our activities and focus on managing the amount, structure, and terms of our debt to limit the risks inherent in debt financing. From time to time, we enter into joint venture arrangements where we believe we can benefit by owning a partial interest in shopping centers and by earning fees for managing the centers for our partners. 

We invest primarily in large, multi-anchored shopping centers that include national chain store tenants and market dominant supermarket tenants. National chain anchor tenants in our centers include, among others, TJ Maxx/Marshalls, Bed Bath and Beyond, Home Depot and Dick's Sporting Goods. Supermarket anchor tenants in our centers include, among others, Publix Super Market, Whole Foods, Kroger and Sprouts. Our shopping centers are primarily located in metropolitan markets such as Metro Detroit, Southeast Florida, Greater Denver, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Jacksonville, Tampa/Lakeland, Milwaukee, Chicago and Atlanta. 

We also own land which is available for development or sale. At December 31, 2015 , we had one project in pre-development and two projects where Phase I of the development was completed. The remaining future phases at those projects are in pre-development. We estimate that if we proceed with the development of the projects, up to approximately 750,000 square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA") could be developed, excluding various outparcels of land. It is our policy to start vertical construction on new development projects only after the project has received entitlements, significant anchor commitments and construction financing, if appropriate. 

Our development and construction activities are subject to risks and uncertainties such as our inability to obtain the necessary governmental approvals for a project, our determination that the expected return on a project is not sufficient to warrant continuation of the planned development, or our change in plan or scope for the development. If any of these events occur, we may record an impairment provision. 

Operating Strategies and Significant Transactions 

Our operating objective is to maximize the risk-adjusted return on invested capital at our shopping centers. We seek to do so by increasing the property operating income of our centers, controlling our capital expenditures, monitoring our tenants&#8217; credit risk and taking actions to mitigate our exposure to that tenant credit risk. 

During 2015 , our consolidated properties reported the following leasing activity:

(1) &#32;&#32;Base rent represents contractual minimum rent under the new lease for the first 12 months of the term. 

(2) &#32;&#32;Non-comparable lease transactions include leases for space vacant for greater than 12 months, leases for space which has been combined from smaller spaces or demised from larger spaces, and leases structured differently from the prior lease. As a result, there is no comparable prior rent per square foot to compare to the base rent per square foot of the new lease. 

Investing Strategies and Significant Transactions 

Our investing objective is to generate an attractive risk-adjusted return on capital invested in acquisitions and developments. In addition, we seek to sell land or shopping centers that we deem to be fully valued or that no longer meet our investment criteria. We underwrite acquisitions based upon current cash flow, projections of future cash flow, and scenario analyses that take into account the risks and opportunities of ownership. We underwrite development of new shopping centers on the same basis, but also take into account the unique risks of entitling land, constructing buildings, and leasing newly built space. 

At December 31, 2015 , we had ten redevelopment, expansion or re-anchoring projects in process with an anticipated cost of $76.8 million, of which $51.5 million remained to be invested. Completion dates are anticipated during 2016 and early 2017. 

In July 2015, we acquired our partner's 80% interest in six properties held in the Ramco 450 Venture LLC ("Ramco 450") and subsequently own 100% of the related properties. We consolidated the six properties based upon a value of approximately $191.1 million, together with the assumption of three mortgage loans with unpaid principal balances totaling approximately $60.1 million, plus any related assets and liabilities. Total consideration paid for the properties was approximately $105.8 million, including closing costs. As part of the same transaction, we sold our 20% interest in one property owned by the same joint venture to our partner, which generated net cash proceeds to us of $10.6 million. The remaining property in the joint venture was sold to a third party in October 2015, generating net proceeds to us of $5.9 million. 

In August 2015, we acquired our partner's 70% interest in one property held in the Ramco/Lion Venture L.P. ("RLV"). We consolidated the property based upon a value of approximately $47.0 million, with total consideration paid of $41.6 million, including approximately $8.7 million of our proportionate share of $29.8 million debt repaid at closing. 

As a result of the above transactions, we gained control of the properties and recognized a gain on remeasurement of unconsolidated joint ventures of $ 7.9 million &#32;which represents the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of our previously held equity investment in the properties. Refer to Note 7 &#32;for additional information regarding our joint venture activity. 

In addition to the above, we completed $16.1 million of acquisitions and $49.8 million &#32;of dispositions in 2015. Refer to Note 4 for additional information related to acquisitions and dispositions. 

Financing Strategies and Significant Transactions 

Our financing objective is to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet in order to ensure access to capital at a competitive cost. In general, we seek to increase our financial flexibility by increasing our pool of unencumbered properties and borrowing on an unsecured basis. In keeping with our objective, we routinely benchmark our balance sheet on a variety of measures to our peers in the shopping center sector and to REITs in general. 

Specifically, we completed the following financing transactions: 

Debt 

During 2015, we issued $150.0 million in senior unsecured notes, repaid $86.5 &#32;million in mortgage notes and assumed $60.1 million in mortgage notes related to our acquisitions. Refer to Note 9 &#32;for additional information related to our debt. 

Equity 

Through our controlled equity offering we issued 0.9 million &#32;common shares at an average share price of $19.28 &#32;and received approximately $17.1 million &#32;in net proceeds during the twelve months ended December 31, &#32; 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , there were 3.1 million &#32;shares remaining under this program. 

In April 2015, we converted preferred shares with a liquidation preference of $7.6 million into 532,628 common shares pursuant to the terms set forth in the convertible preferred shares prospectus supplement dated April 27, 2011 and incurred conversion costs of approximately $0.5 million. 

As of December 31, 2015 &#32;we had net debt to total market capitalization of 42.3% &#32;as compared to 35.7% , at December 31, 2014 . At December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;we had $286.5 million &#32;and $335.9 million , respectively, available to draw under our unsecured revolving line of credit.

Employment
