 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Headquartered in Durham, North Carolina (&#34;NC&#34;), the Company is a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of NC in 1999, and is registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#34;BHCA&#34;). The Company's primary function is to serve as the holding company for its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bank, a NC chartered commercial bank that was organized in 1907 and began operations in 1908.

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had assets of approximately $298.3 million, with gross loans of approximately $164.8 million and deposits of approximately $254.7 million. The Company's corporate office is located at 2634 Durham Chapel Hill Boulevard, Durham, NC, 27707, and its telephone number is 919-687-7800.

&#160; 

The Company's principal source of income is from dividends declared and paid by the Bank on its issued and outstanding capital stock. The Company uses such income to pay dividends to stockholders and fund its expenses. The majority of the Company's operations occur at the Bank level. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, results of operations will be discussed by referring to the Bank's operations, unless a specific reference is made to the Company and its operating results apart from those of the Bank.

&#160;

The Bank is a community bank engaged in the general banking business in Wake, Durham, Guilford, Forsyth, and Mecklenburg Counties and the surrounding areas. Both the Company and the Bank are designated by the United States Department of the Treasury (the &#8220;Treasury&#8221;) as a Community Development Financial Institution (&#8220;CDFI&#8221;). As defined by the Treasury, a CDFI is a community-based organization that provides credit, financial services, and other related services in low-income urban and rural communities across America. These organizations have a common mission of working toward revitalizing economically depressed communities or communities underserved by mainstream financial institutions and improving the quality of life of those who live and work in these communities. CDFIs provide financing to residents who want to buy their first home, individuals who may want to start their own business and owners of existing businesses who would like to expand their businesses (helping to create new jobs). In addition, CDFIs offer financial literacy services to individuals on topics such as improving their credit ratings or creating monthly budgets.

&#160;

The Bank offers a full range of banking services, including the following: checking accounts, savings accounts, Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (&#34;NOW&#34;) accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, individual retirement accounts, equity lines of credit, credit lines, consumer loans, credit cards, safe deposit boxes, internet banking, mobile banking, electronic funds transfer services including wire transfers, traveler's checks, notary services, and loans for real estate, construction, businesses, personal use, home improvement and automobiles. In addition, the Bank provides automated teller machine (&#8220;ATM&#8221;) access to its customers for cash withdrawals through nationwide ATM networks. At present, the Bank does not provide the services of a trust department.

&#160;

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF MARKET AREAS 

&#160;

The Bank has two branch offices in Durham, NC, two offices in Raleigh, NC, one office in Charlotte, NC, one office in Winston-Salem, NC, and one office in Greensboro, NC. All offices are located in metropolitan areas with employment spread primarily among service, health care, education, manufacturing and governmental activities. All offices are located in areas of high competition among financial service providers.

&#160;

COMPETITION 

&#160;

Commercial banking in NC is extremely competitive. The Bank competes in its market areas with some of the largest banking organizations in the state and the country, other community financial institutions, such as federally and state-chartered banks or savings and loan institutions, credit unions, consumer finance companies, mortgage companies and other lenders engaged in the business of extending credit. Many of the Bank's competitors have broader geographic markets, easier access to capital, lower cost of funding, and higher lending limits than the Bank, and are able to provide more services, and make greater use of media advertising.

&#160;

Despite strong competition in its market areas, the Bank believes that it has certain competitive advantages that distinguish it from its competition. The Bank believes that its primary competitive advantages are its 108-year legacy, strong local identity, affiliation with the communities it serves, and its emphasis on providing specialized services to small- and medium-sized business and special purpose enterprises, faith-based non-profit organizations and individuals. The Bank offers customers modern, high-tech banking without compromising community values such as prompt, personal service and friendliness. The Bank offers personalized services and attracts customers by being responsive and sensitive to their individual needs. The Bank relies on goodwill and referrals from stockholders, board members, employees, and satisfied customers, as well as traditional methods to attract new customers. To enhance a positive image in the communities in which it has branches, the Bank supports and participates in select local events and many of its officers and directors serve on boards of local civic and charitable organizations.

&#160; 

The ability of the Bank to attract and retain deposits generally depends on its ability to provide a rate of return, liquidity and risk comparable to that offered by competing investment opportunities. As of June 30, 2015, based on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;) Summary of Deposits Report, the Bank's market share of the total deposits in Durham, NC was 1.45%, and less than one percent in each of Raleigh, Charlotte, Greensboro and Winston-Salem, NC. Management believes that the Bank is not dependent upon any single customer, or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Bank&#8217;s operations. However, the Bank does serve a specialized niche market (faith-based non-profit organizations), the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations.

&#160;

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company and the Bank had 70 employees, including 67 full-time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Management considers relations with employees to be good.

&#160; 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

&#160;

Bank holding companies and commercial banks are subject to extensive federal and state governmental regulation and supervision. The following is a brief summary of certain statutes and regulations that apply to the Company and Bank. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute and regulatory provisions cited below and are not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to the business of the Company and the Bank. Supervision, regulation and examination of the Company and the Bank by the regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather than stockholders of the Company . 

&#160; 

Statutes and regulations, which contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations, and competitive relationship of financial institutions, are introduced regularly. The Company cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed statute or regulation may be adopted or the extent to which the business of the Company and the Bank may be affected by such statute or regulation.

&#160;

In certain circumstances, the FDIC can require a holding company to guarantee the compliance of its subsidiary insured depository institution with any capital restoration plan. The FDIC's claim for damages is superior to claims of stockholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured depository institutions.

&#160; 

Monetary Policy and Economic Controls 

&#160;

The Company and the Bank are directly affected by governmental policies and regulatory measures affecting the banking industry in general. Of primary importance is the Federal Reserve, whose actions directly affect the money supply, which, in turn, affects banks' lending abilities by increasing or decreasing the cost and availability of funds to banks. The Federal Reserve regulates the availability of bank credit in order to combat recession and curb inflationary pressures in the economy by open market operations in United States government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings, changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits, and limitations on interest rates that banks may pay on time and savings deposits.

&#160;

Deregulation of interest rates paid by banks on deposits and the types of deposits that may be offered by banks has eliminated minimum balance requirements and rate ceilings on various types of time deposit accounts. The effect of these specific actions and, in general, the deregulation of deposit interest rates has generally increased banks' cost of funds and made them more sensitive to fluctuations in money market rates. In view of the changing conditions in the national economy and money markets, as well as the effect of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, no prediction can be made as to possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand, or the business and earnings of the Bank or the Company. As a result, banks, including the Bank, face a significant challenge to maintain acceptable net interest margins.

&#160; 

Company Regulation 

&#160;

General . The Company is a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. As such, the Company is subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements contained in the BHCA and the regulation of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has the power to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary, when it believes that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company.

&#160;

Dodd&#8211;Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act . In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) was signed into law. This law has significantly changed the current bank regulatory structure and is affecting the lending, deposit, investment, trading, and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies have significant discretion in drafting rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many years. The Dodd-Frank Act included, among other things:

&#160;

&#8226; the creation of a Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify emerging systemic risks posed by financial firms, activities and practices, and to improve cooperation between federal agencies;

&#8226; the creation of a Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;) authorized to promulgate and enforce consumer protection regulations relating to financial products, which would affect both banks and non-bank financial companies;

&#8226; the establishment of strengthened capital and prudential standards for banks and bank holding companies;

&#8226; enhanced regulation of financial markets, including derivatives and securitization markets;

5&#160;

&#160;

M&#38;F BANCORP, INC., AND SUBSIDIARY 

&#8226; the elimination of certain trading activities by banks;

&#8226; a permanent increase of FDIC deposit insurance to $250,000 per deposit category and an increase in the minimum deposit insurance fund reserve requirement from 1.15% to 1.35%, with assessments to be based on assets as opposed to deposits;

&#8226; amendments to the Truth in Lending Act aimed at improving consumer protections with respect to mortgage originations, including originator compensation, minimum repayment standards, and prepayment considerations; and

&#8226; new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance.

&#160;

A number of other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act remain to be implemented through the rulemaking process at various regulatory agencies. We are unable to predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act or the forthcoming rules and regulations will impact our business. However, we believe that certain aspects of the legislation, including, without limitation, the costs of compliance with disclosure and reporting requirements and examinations could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, we cannot predict whether there will be additional proposed laws or reforms that would affect the U.S. financial system or financial institutions, whether or when such changes may be adopted, how such changes may be interpreted and enforced, or how such changes may affect us.

&#160;

Federal Securities Law. The Company's common stock is registered with the SEC pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). As a result, the proxy and tender offer rules, insider trading reporting requirements, annual and periodic reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act are applicable to the Company. The regulatory compliance burden of being a publicly traded company has increased significantly.

&#160; 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the &#34;GLB Act&#34;) dramatically changed various federal laws governing the banking, securities and insurance industries. The GLB Act expanded opportunities for banks and bank holding companies to provide services and engage in other revenue-generating activities that previously were prohibited to them. However, this expanded authority presents the Company with challenges, as its larger competitors are able to expand their services and products into areas that are not feasible for smaller, community-oriented financial institutions. The GLB Act has had a significant economic impact on the banking industry and on competitive conditions in the financial services industry generally.

&#160; 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was signed into law in 2002 (&#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley&#8221;) and became some of the most sweeping federal legislation addressing accounting, corporate governance and disclosure issues. The impact of Sarbanes-Oxley has been wide-ranging as it applies to all public companies and imposes significant requirements for public company governance and disclosure.

&#160;

In general, Sarbanes-Oxley mandated important corporate governance and financial reporting requirements intended to enhance the accuracy and transparency of public companies' reported financial results. It established responsibilities for corporate chief executive officers, chief financial officers and audit committees in the financial reporting process and created a regulatory body to oversee auditors of public companies. It backed these requirements with SEC enforcement tools, increased criminal penalties for federal mail, wire and securities fraud, and created criminal penalties for document and record destruction in connection with federal investigations. It also increased the opportunity for more private litigation by lengthening the statute of limitations for securities fraud claims and providing federal corporate whistleblower protection.

&#160; 

The economic and operational effects of this legislation on public companies, including the Company, have been and will continue to be significant in terms of the time, resources and costs associated with complying with its requirements. Because Sarbanes-Oxley, for the most part, applies equally to larger and smaller public companies, the Company has additional challenges as a smaller financial institution seeking to compete with larger financial institutions in its market. In accordance with the requirements of Section 404(a), management's report on internal control is included herein as Item 9A. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently exempted smaller companies, such as the Company, from the requirements under Section 404(b) for auditor attestation on internal controls.

&#160;

Prohibited and Permissible Activities of Bank Holding Companies. The BHCA generally prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from engaging in activities other than banking, or managing or controlling banks or other permissible subsidiaries, and from acquiring or retaining direct or indirect control of any company engaged in any activities other than those activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking. In determining whether a particular activity is permissible, the Federal Reserve must consider whether the performance of such an activity may be reasonably expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices.

&#160;

Pursuant to delegated authority, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (the &#8220;FRB&#8221;) has authority to approve certain activities of holding companies within its district, including the Company, provided the nature of the activity has been approved by the Federal Reserve.

&#160; 

Additional Restrictions and Oversight . Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve on any extensions of credit to the bank holding Company or any of its subsidiaries, investments in the stock or securities thereof and the acceptance of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prevented from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of services. An example of a prohibited tie -in would be any arrangement that would condition the provision or cost of services on a customer obtaining additional services from the bank holding Company or any of its other subsidiaries.

&#160;

The Federal Reserve may issue cease and desist orders (often referred to as &#34;consent orders&#34;) against bank holding companies and non-bank subsidiaries to stop actions believed to present a serious threat to a subsidiary bank. The Federal Reserve regulates certain debt obligations, changes in control of bank holding companies and capital requirements.

&#160;

As a result of the Company's ownership of the Bank, the Company is registered under the bank holding company laws of NC. Accordingly, the Company is also subject to supervision and regulation by the NCCOB.

&#160;

&#160;

M&#38;F BANCORP, INC., AND SUBSIDIARY 

Capital Requirements. The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company&#8217;s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company&#8217;s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. On August 7, 2015, the Bank entered into a revised Memorandum of Understanding (the &#8220;Bank MOU&#8221;) between the FDIC and the Office of the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks. The Bank MOU requires that the Bank maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8%, and our other regulatory capital ratios at such levels so as to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes. We continue to be in full compliance with this requirement of the Bank MOU. See &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Memoranda of Understanding&#8221; for additional information relating to the Company MOU.

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1 and total capital as a percentage of assets and off-balance-sheet exposures, adjusted for risk weights ranging from 0% to 100%. Tier 1 capital of the Company consists of common shareholders&#8217; equity, excluding the unrealized gain or loss on securities available-for-sale, minus certain intangible assets. The Company&#8217;s Tier 2 capital consists of the allowance for loan losses subject to certain limitations. Total capital for purposes of computing the capital ratios consists of the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. The regulatory minimum requirements are 4% for Tier 1 capital and 8% for total risk-based capital; under the provisions of the Bank MOU the Bank will be required to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10%. However, as the Company has less than $500 million in assets, its activities and regulatory capital structure are de-emphasized pursuant to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, with all significant business activities attributed to the Bank by the Company&#8217;s regulators.

The Company and the Bank are also required to maintain capital at a minimum level based on quarterly average assets, which is known as the leverage ratio. Only the strongest banks are allowed to maintain capital at the minimum requirement of 3%. All others are subject to maintaining ratios 1% to 2% above the minimum.

The Company and the Bank were each considered to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2015. See &#8220;Capital Resources&#8221; for capital ratios. 

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency each approved final rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, among other changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The rules will apply to all national and state banks, such as the Bank, and savings associations and most bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies, which we collectively refer to herein as &#8220;covered banking organizations.&#8221; Bank holding companies with less than $500 million in total consolidated assets, such as the Company, are not subject to the final rules, nor are savings and loan holding companies substantially engaged in commercial activities or insurance underwriting. The framework requires covered banking organizations to hold more and higher quality capital, which acts as a financial cushion to absorb losses, taking into account the impact of risk. The approved rules include a new minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% as well as a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4% to 6% and include a minimum leverage ratio of 4% for all banking institutions. In terms of quality of capital, the final rules emphasize common equity Tier 1 capital and implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. The final rules also change the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity. The requirements in the rules began to phase in on January 1, 2015 for &#8220;standardized approach&#8221; banking organizations such as the Bank. The requirements in the rules will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019. The ultimate impact of the new capital standards on the Bank is currently being reviewed.

Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the &#8220;EESA&#8221;), as amended, the Treasury implemented the Troubled Asset Relief Program (&#8220;TARP&#8221;), of which the Capital Purchase Program (the &#8220;CPP&#8221;) is a part. Under the CPP, certain U.S. qualifying financial institutions sold senior preferred stock and warrants to the Treasury. Eligible institutions generally applied to issue preferred stock to the Treasury in aggregate amounts between 1% and 3% of the institution's risk-weighted assets. Smaller community banks and bank holding companies, such as the Company, were later allowed to issue preferred stock up to 5% of the institution's risk weighted assets.

&#160; 

The Treasury was given discretion to exempt certain financial institutions from having to issue warrants. The Treasury elected to exercise its discretion in favor of those financial institutions that are certified as CDFIs, and for whom the CPP investment was $50 million or less. Accordingly, the Company was exempted from issuing warrants. On June 26, 2009, the Company completed the issuance of 11,735 shares of $1,000 value Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (&#34;Series A Preferred Stock&#34;) under the CPP. On August 20, 2010, the Company exchanged the Series A Preferred Stock for an equal number of shares of $1,000 liquidation value, Series B Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (&#8220;Series B Preferred Stock&#8221;), under the Community Development Capital Initiative (&#8220;CDCI&#8221;), also part of the TARP.

&#160;

Executive Compensation. The EESA, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (&#8220;ARRA&#8221;), which was signed into law on February 17, 2009, introduced extensive restrictions on executive compensation arrangements of financial institutions participating in TARP programs, including the CPP and the CDCI. On June 15, 2009, the Treasury published the Interim Final Rules in the Federal Register, which further supplement these executive compensation restrictions.

&#160;

Dividend and Repurchase Limitations . Under a Memorandum of Understanding (&#34;MOU&#34;) with the FRB executed in August 2010, the Company agreed to obtain FRB approval prior to repurchasing or redeeming any shares of its stock, declaring or paying any dividends or taking dividends or any other form of payment representing a reduction in capital from the Bank.

&#160; 

7&#160;

&#160;

M&#38;F BANCORP, INC., AND SUBSIDIARY 

Federal banking regulations applicable to all bank holding companies separately restrict the Company from repurchasing its common stock for consideration in excess of 10% of its net worth during any 12-month period unless the Company (i) both before and after the redemption satisfies capital requirements for &#34;well capitalized&#34; state bank holding companies; (ii) received a &#8220;one&#8221; or &#8220;two&#8221; rating in its last examination; and (iii) is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues. In addition, as a bank holding company, the Company is required to adhere to the Federal Reserve's Policy Statement on Payment of Cash Dividends, which generally requires bank holding companies to act as a source of strength and not place undue burden on subsidiary banks.

&#160;

Under NC corporation laws, the Company may not pay a dividend or distribution, if after giving its effect, the Company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or the Company's total assets would be less than its liabilities. In general, the Company's ability to pay cash dividends is dependent upon the amount of dividends paid to the Company by the Bank. NC commercial banks, such as the Bank, are subject to legal limitations on the amounts of dividends they are permitted to pay. For instance, NC commercial banks are prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the bank would become &#34;undercapitalized&#34; (as such term is defined in the applicable law and regulations). Further, under the terms of the Bank MOU entered into with the FDIC and the NCCOB on August 7, 2015, the Bank may not declare dividends to the Company without prior approval from the FDIC and NCCOB.

&#160; 

Participation in the CDCI places restrictions on the Company's ability to declare or pay dividends or distributions on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration, shares of its capital stock, including restrictions against the Company (i) increasing dividends payable on its common stock from the last quarterly cash dividend per share declared on the common stock prior to November 17, 2008; (ii) increasing its aggregate per share dividends and distributions above the aggregate dividends and distributions paid for the immediately prior fiscal year; and (iii) declaring or paying dividends or distributions on, or repurchasing, redeeming or otherwise acquiring for consideration, shares of its capital stock in the event that the Company fails to declare and pay full dividends (or declare and set aside a sum sufficient for payment thereof) on the Series B Preferred Stock. These restrictions will continue until all of the Series B Preferred Stock has been redeemed in full. During 2015, no common stock dividends were declared; therefore, no common stock dividends can be declared in the future until such time as all of the Series B Preferred Stock has been redeemed in full.

&#160; 

Bank Regulation 

&#160; 

The Bank is subject to numerous state and federal statutes and regulations that affect its business, activities, and operations, and is supervised and examined by the NCCOB and the FDIC. The FDIC and the NCCOB regularly examine the operations of banks over which they exercise jurisdiction. They have the authority to approve or disapprove the establishment or closing of branches, mergers, consolidations and other similar corporate actions. They have authority to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices and other violations of law. The FDIC and the NCCOB regulate and monitor all areas of the operations of banks and their subsidiaries, including loans, mortgages, capital adequacy, loss reserves and compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) as well as other laws and regulations. Interest and certain other charges collected and contracted for by banks are subject to state usury laws and certain federal laws concerning interest rates.

&#160;

Federal Deposit Insurance. The Deposit Insurance Fund (&#34;DIF&#34;) of the FDIC insures deposit accounts in the Bank up to a maximum amount per separately insured depositor. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the maximum amount of federal deposit insurance coverage permanently increased to $250,000 per depositor, per institution.

&#160; 

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#34;FDICIA&#34;) the federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions. FDICIA identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions: &#34;well capitalized,&#34; &#34;adequately capitalized,&#34; &#34;undercapitalized,&#34; &#34;significantly undercapitalized,&#34; and &#34;critically undercapitalized.&#34; Under regulations established by the federal banking agencies, a &#34;well capitalized&#34; institution must have a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of at least 6.0%, a Total Capital Ratio of at least 10.0%, a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of at least 5.0% and not be subject to a capital directive order. The Bank MOU requires the Bank to maintain a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of not less than 8.0% and a Total Risk Based Capital Ratio of not less than 10.0%. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank was classified as &#34;well capitalized&#34; and satisfied the heightened capital requirements of the Bank MOU. The classification of a depository institution under FDICIA is primarily for the purpose of applying the federal banking agencies' prompt corrective action provisions, and is not intended to be, nor should it be interpreted as, a representation of the overall financial condition or the prospects of any financial institution.

&#160; 

The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.

&#160;

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an insured institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. Management of the Bank is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of its FDIC deposit insurance.

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment and Consumer Protection Laws. In connection with its lending activities, the Bank is subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the CRA. In addition, federal banking regulators, pursuant to the GLB Act, have enacted regulations limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third parties. The regulations require disclosure of privacy policies and allow consumers to prevent certain personal information from being shared with non-affiliated third parties.

&#160;

The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the bank's record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of &#34;outstanding,&#34; &#34;satisfactory,&#34; &#34;needs to improve,&#34; or &#34;substantial non-compliance.&#34; The Bank received an &#34;outstanding&#34; rating in its most recent CRA evaluation.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB to take over responsibility for the federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB is an independent bureau within the Federal Reserve that has broad rule making, supervisory and examination authority to set and enforce rules in the consumer protection area over financial institutions that have assets of $10 billion or more. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB expanded data-collecting powers for fair lending purposes for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as expanded authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices. It is anticipated that certain of the CFPB's rules will be indirectly applied to the Bank, through their adoption by the Bank's regulators as &#8220;best practices.&#8221;

&#160; 

Bank Secrecy Act / Anti-Money Laundering Laws. The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015. The USA PATRIOT Act substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by creating new laws, regulations, and penalties, imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the U.S. These laws and regulations, which were extended in 2015 by the USA FREEDOM Act, require the Bank to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report potential money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, these Acts require the federal banking agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution's anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions.

&#160; 

Other Safety and Soundness Regulations. As required by FDICIA, the federal banking agencies' prompt corrective action powers impose progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. These actions can include: requiring an insured depository institution to adopt a capital restoration plan guaranteed by the institution's parent company; placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities, including restrictions on transactions with affiliates; restricting the interest rates the institution may pay on deposits; prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; prohibiting the holding company from making capital distributions without prior regulatory approval; and, ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution.

&#160;

The federal banking agencies also have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, and compensation and benefits. The federal regulatory agencies may take action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards.

&#160;

Capital Requirements for the Bank. As an NC-chartered, insured commercial bank, which is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is also subject to capital requirements imposed by the FDIC. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC approved revisions to their capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules that implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly called Basel III, and address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. &#8220;Basel III&#8221; refers to two consultative documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2009, the rules text released in December 2010, and loss absorbency rules issued in January 2011, which include significant changes to bank capital, leverage and liquidity requirements.

&#160;

The rules include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective on January 1, 2015, and revise the definition of what constitutes &#8220;capital&#8221; for purposes of calculating those ratios. The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% (increased from 4.0%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0% for all institutions. The rules eliminate the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 capital. Instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 will be grandfathered for companies with consolidated assets of $15 billion or less. The rules also establish a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital and result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The Bank exceeded all applicable capital requirements as of December 31, 2015. The new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that may be utilized for such actions.

Federal Home Loan Bank System . The Federal Home Loan Bank system provides a central credit facility for member institutions. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (&#34;FHLB&#34;), the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB in an amount at least equal to 0.09% (or 9 basis points) of the Bank's total assets at the end of each calendar year, plus 4.5% of its outstanding advances (borrowings) from the FHLB under the activity-based stock ownership requirement. On December 31, 2015, the Bank was in compliance with this requirement.

&#160; 

Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates. The Bank is subject to the provisions of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W. Section 23A places limits on the amount of:

&#160;

&#8226; a bank's loans or extensions of credit to, or investment in, its affiliates; &#8226; assets a bank may purchase from affiliates, except for real and personal property exempted by the Federal Reserve; &#8226; the amount of loans or extensions of credit by a bank to third parties which are collateralized by the securities or obligations of the bank's affiliates; and &#8226; a bank's guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of one of its affiliates. &#160;

The total amount of the above transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of a bank's capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of a bank's capital and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, each of the above transactions must meet specified collateral requirements. The Bank must comply with other provisions designed to avoid the transfer of low-quality assets from an affiliate.

&#160;

The Bank is subject to the provisions of Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which, among other things, prohibits a bank from engaging in the above transactions with its affiliates, unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank or its

subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies.

&#160; 

Under Section 22(h), loans to directors, executive officers and stockholders who own more than 10% of a depository institution (18% in the case of institutions located in an area with less than 30,000 in population), and certain affiliated entities of any of the foregoing, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated entities, the institution's loans-to-one-borrower limit (as discussed below). Section 22 (h) prohibits loans above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency to directors, executive officers and stockholders who own more than 10% of an institution, and their respective affiliates, unless such loans are approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the institution. Any &#34;interested&#34; director may not participate in the voting. The FDIC has prescribed the loan amount (which includes all other outstanding loans to such person), as to which such prior board of directors approval is required, as being the greater of $25,000 or 5% of capital and surplus (up to $500,000). Further, pursuant to Section 22(h), the Federal Reserve requires that loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions with non-executive employees of the Bank. The FDIC has imposed additional limits on the amount a bank can loan to an executive officer.

&#160;

Limits on Rates Paid on Deposits and Brokered Deposits. FDIC regulations limit the ability of insured depository institutions to accept, renew or roll-over deposits by offering rates of interest which are significantly higher than the prevailing rates of interest on deposits offered by other insured depository institutions having the same type of charter in such depository institution's normal market area. Under these regulations, &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; depository institutions may accept, renew or roll-over such deposits without restriction, &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; depository institutions may accept, renew or roll-over such deposits with a waiver from the FDIC (subject to certain restrictions on payments of rates) and &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; depository institutions may not accept, renew, or roll-over such deposits. Definitions of &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; are the same as the definitions adopted by the FDIC to implement the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above.

&#160;

The Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (&#8220;SAFE Act&#8221;). The SAFE Act was enacted to enhance consumer protection and reduce fraud by setting minimum standards for the licensing and registration of mortgage loan originators. The SAFE Act requires mortgage loan originators employed by insured depository institutions or their subsidiaries to register with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry and to maintain current registration in that system. Financial institutions are required by the SAFE Act to maintain adequate policies and practices, which will ensure that all employees acting in the capacity of mortgage loan originators register in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and update their registration annually during the annual renewal period in November and December of each year.

&#160;

Other. Additional regulations require annual examinations of all insured depository institutions by the appropriate federal banking agency, with some exceptions for small, well-capitalized institutions and state chartered institutions examined by state regulators. Additional regulations establish operational and managerial, asset quality, earnings and stock valuation standards for insured depository institutions, as well as compensation standards.

&#160;

In addition, the Bank is subject to various other state and federal laws and regulations, including state usury laws, laws relating to fiduciaries, consumer credit and equal credit, fair credit reporting laws and laws relating to branch banking. The Bank, as an insured NC commercial bank, is prohibited from engaging as a principal in activities that are not permitted for national banks, unless (i) the FDIC determines that the activity would pose no significant risk to the appropriate deposit insurance fund and (ii) the Bank is, and continues to be, in compliance with all applicable capital standards.
