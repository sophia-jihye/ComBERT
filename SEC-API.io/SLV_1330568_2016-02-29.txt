 Item 1. Business . 

&#160; 

The purpose of the iShares &#174; Silver Trust (the &#8220;Trust&#8221;) is to own silver transferred to the Trust in exchange for shares issued by the Trust (&#8220;Shares&#8221;). Each Share represents a fractional undivided beneficial interest in the net assets of the Trust. The assets of the Trust consist primarily of silver held by the Trust&#8217;s custodian on behalf of the Trust. However, there may be situations where the Trust will unexpectedly hold cash. For example, a claim may arise against a third party, which is settled in cash. In situations where the Trust unexpectedly receives cash or other assets, no new Shares will be issued until after the record date for the distribution of such cash or other property has passed. 

&#160; 

The Trust was formed on April 21, 2006 when an initial deposit of silver was made in exchange for the issuance of three Baskets (a &#8220;Basket&#8221; consists of 50,000 Shares). The Trust is a grantor trust formed under the laws of the State of New York. 

&#160; 

The sponsor of the Trust is iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC (the &#8220;Sponsor&#8221;), a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. The trustee of the Trust is The Bank of New York Mellon (the &#8220;Trustee&#8221;) and the custodian of the Trust is JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., London branch (the &#8220;Custodian&#8221;). The agreement between the Trust and the Custodian is governed by English law. The Trust does not have any officers, directors or employees. 

&#160; 

The Trust&#8217;s net asset value fell from $5,260,801,879 at December 31, 2014 to $4,391,943,604 at December 31, 2015, the Trust&#8217;s fiscal year end. Outstanding Shares of the Trust fell from 344,000,000 Shares outstanding at December 31, 2014 to 333,550,000 Shares outstanding at December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

The activities of the Trust are limited to (1) issuing Baskets in exchange for the silver deposited with the Custodian as consideration, (2) selling silver as necessary to cover the Sponsor&#8217;s fee, Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor and other liabilities, and (3) delivering silver in exchange for Baskets surrendered for redemption. The Trust is not actively managed. It does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or to ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the price of silver. 

&#160; 

The Sponsor of the registrant maintains an Internet website at www.ishares.com, through which the registrant&#8217;s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), are made available free of charge after they have been filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). Additional information regarding the Trust may also be found on the SEC&#8217;s EDGAR database at www.sec.gov. 

&#160; 

Trust Objective 

&#160; 

The Trust seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of silver. The Trust seeks to reflect such performance before payment of the Trust&#8217;s expenses and liabilities. The Shares are intended to constitute a simple and cost-effective means of making an investment similar to an investment in silver. An investment in physical silver requires expensive and sometimes complicated arrangements in connection with the assay, transportation, warehousing and insurance of the metal. Traditionally, such expense and complications have resulted in investments in physical silver being efficient only in amounts beyond the reach of many investors. The Shares have been designed to remove the obstacles represented by the expense and complications involved in an investment in physical silver, while at the same time having an intrinsic value that reflects, at any given time, the price of the silver owned by the Trust at such time, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and liabilities. Although the Shares are not the exact equivalent of an investment in silver, they provide investors with an alternative that allow a level of participation in the silver market through the securities market. 

&#160; 

An investment in Shares is: 

&#160; 

Backed by silver held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust. 

&#160; 

The Shares are backed by the assets of the Trust. The Trustee&#8217;s arrangements with the Custodian contemplate that at the end of each business day there can be in the Trust account maintained by the Custodian no more than 1,100 ounces of silver in an unallocated form. The bulk of the Trust&#8217;s silver holdings is represented by physical silver, identified on the Custodian&#8217;s books in allocated and unallocated accounts on behalf of the Trust and held by the Custodian in England, New York and other locations that may be authorized in the future. 

&#160; 

As accessible and easy to handle as any other investment in shares. 

&#160; 

Retail investors may purchase and sell Shares through traditional brokerage accounts. Because the intrinsic value of each Share is a function of the price of silver held by the Trust, the cash outlay necessary for an investment in Shares should be less than the amount required for currently existing means of investing in physical silver. Shares are eligible for margin accounts. 

&#160; 

Listed. 

&#160; 

The Shares are listed and trade on NYSE Arca, Inc. (&#8220;NYSE Arca&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;SLV.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Relatively cost efficient. 

&#160; 

Because the expenses involved in an investment in physical silver are dispersed among all holders of Shares, an investment in Shares may represent a cost-efficient alternative to investments in silver for investors not otherwise in a position to participate directly in the market for physical silver. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Secondary Market Trading 

&#160; 

While the Trust seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of silver less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and liabilities, Shares may trade at, above or below their net asset value per Share, or &#8220;NAV.&#8221; The NAV of Shares will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Trust&#8217;s assets. The trading prices of Shares will fluctuate in accordance with changes in their NAV, as well as market supply and demand. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the major silver markets and NYSE Arca. While the Shares trade on NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. (New York time), liquidity in the market for silver may be reduced after the close of the major world silver markets, including London, Zurich and the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (&#8220;COMEX&#8221;) in Chicago. As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on Shares may widen. However, given that Baskets of Shares can be created and redeemed in exchange for the underlying amount of silver, the Sponsor believes that the arbitrage opportunities may provide a mechanism to mitigate the effect of such premium or discount. 

&#160; 

Custody of the Trust&#8217;s Silver 

&#160; 

The Custodian is responsible for safekeeping the Trust&#8217;s silver. The Custodian may keep the Trust&#8217;s silver at its vault premises in England or New York, or at the vaults of any sub-custodian in England or New York, unless otherwise agreed between the Custodian and the Trustee (with the Sponsor&#8217;s approval). The Custodian may use sub-custodians to discharge its obligations to the Trust. The Custodian is required to use reasonable care in the appointment of any sub-custodian. Any sub-custodian must be a member of the London Bullion Market Association (&#8220;LBMA&#8221;). The use of sub-custodians does not affect the Custodian&#8217;s liability to the Trustee under the custodian agreement. 

&#160; 

The Custodian has agreed to use reasonable care in the performance of its duties under the custodian agreement and will only be responsible for any loss or damage suffered by the Trust as a direct result of any negligence, fraud or willful default on the part of the Custodian. The Custodian&#8217;s liability is limited to the market value of any silver lost and the amount of any balance held on unallocated basis at the time of the Custodian&#8217;s negligence, fraud or willful default. 

&#160; 

None of the Custodian, its directors, employees, agents or affiliates will incur any liability to the Trust if, by reason of any provision of any present or future law or regulation of the United Kingdom or any other country, or of any governmental or regulatory authority or stock exchange, or by reason of any act of God or war, terrorism or other circumstance beyond the Custodian&#8217;s control, the Custodian is prevented or forbidden from, or would be subject to any civil or criminal penalty on account of, or is delayed in, performing its obligations to the Trust. The Custodian has agreed to indemnify the Trustee for any loss or liability directly resulting from a breach of the Custodian&#8217;s representations and warranties in the custodian agreement, a failure of the Custodian to act or refrain from acting in accordance with the Trustee&#8217;s instructions or any physical loss, destruction or damage to the silver held for the Trust&#8217;s account, except for losses due to nuclear fission or fusion, radioactivity, war, terrorist event, invasion, insurrection, civil commotion, riot, strike, act of government or public authority, act of God or a similar cause that is beyond the control of the Custodian. 

&#160; 

The Custodian has agreed to maintain insurance in support of its custodial obligations under the custodian agreement, including covering any loss of silver. The Custodian has the right to reduce, cancel or allow to expire without replacement such insurance coverage, provided that it gives prior written notice to the Trustee. In the case of a cancellation or expiration without replacement, the required notice must be at least 30 days prior to the last day of coverage. The Trustee has not received from the Custodian any notice of reduction, cancellation or expiration of its insurance coverage. The insurance is held for the benefit of the Custodian, not for the benefit of the Trust or the Trustee, and the Trustee may not submit a claim under the insurance maintained by the Custodian. 

&#160; 

The Custodian has agreed to grant to the officers and properly designated representatives of the Trustee and to the independent public accountants for the Trust access to the Custodian&#8217;s records for the purpose of confirming the content of those records. Upon at least ten days&#8217; prior notice, any such officer or properly designated representative, the independent public accountants for the Trust and any person designated by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Trustee or the Trust is entitled to examine on the Custodian&#8217;s premises the silver held by the Custodian and the records regarding the silver held for the account of the Custodian at a sub-custodian. The Custodian has agreed that it will only retain sub-custodians if they agree to grant to the Trustee and the independent registered public accounting firm of the Trust access to records and inspection rights similar to those set forth above. During the period covered by this report, Inspectorate International Ltd. and Inspectorate American Corporation, acting as authorized representatives of the Trustee pursuant to the foregoing provisions, inspected the premises where the Trust&#8217;s silver is warehoused and on April 22, 2015 issued their report summarizing their findings. Such report was posted by the Sponsor on the Trust&#8217;s website. During the period covered by this report, the Sponsor visited the premises where the Trust&#8217;s silver is warehoused once (in the quarter ended March 31, 2015). 

&#160; 

Valuation of Silver; Computation of Net Asset Value 

&#160; 

On each business day, as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m. (New York time), the Trustee evaluates the silver held by the Trust and determines the net asset value of the Trust and the NAV. For purposes of making these calculations, a business day means any day other than a day when NYSE Arca is closed for regular trading. 

&#160; 

The Trustee values the silver held by the Trust using the price per ounce of silver determined by the CME Group at approximately 12:00 p.m., London time, and announced by Thomson Reuters shortly thereafter on each day that the London silver market is open for business (&#8220;LBMA Silver Price&#8221;). If there is no announced LBMA Silver Price on a business day, the Trustee is authorized to use the most recently announced LBMA Silver Price unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for evaluation. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The LBMA Silver Price is the spot price per ounce, in U.S. dollars, of a London Good Delivery Bar determined by the CME Group following one or more thirty-second electronic auctions conducted starting at 12:00 p.m., London time, on each day that the London silver market is open for business, and announced by Thomson Reuters shortly thereafter, all under the auspices of the LBMA. Twenty seconds before noon (London time) on each day that the LBMA Silver Price is to be determined, a seed price for the first auction is determined by the CME Group, taking into account relevant pricing information available at the time, and announced to eligible auction participants previously qualified on the basis of criteria set by the LBMA. Beginning at 12:00 p.m., London time, such participants are allowed, but not required, to electronically submit during a thirty-second period buy and/or sell orders for spot transactions at the seed price. If at the conclusion of the thirty-second auction the market is determined by the CME Group to be balanced, the seed price is the LBMA Silver Price for that date and announced as such by Thomson Reuters. If the market is not balanced at the end of the first auction, a new seed price is automatically calculated and announced, and an additional thirty-second auction is held at the new price. If necessary, the process is repeated until the market is determined to be balanced and the price at which that determination occurs is the LBMA Silver Price for that date. For these purposes, the market is considered to be balanced when, at the end of an auction, the total number of ounces of silver for which buy orders were submitted in that auction falls within a certain pre-determined margin of tolerance from the total number of ounces of silver for which sell orders were submitted in the auction. Once the LBMA Silver Price has been determined for a given day, the buy and sell orders entered by the auction participants during the last auction will be executed at that day&#8217;s LBMA Silver Price. Any market imbalance remaining after the last auction (which must be within the margin of tolerance) is allocated equally among all participants in all auctions conducted on that day (and not only those participating in the last auction). As of the date of this report, information publicly available on LBMA&#8217;s website indicates that the entities currently qualified to submit orders during the electronic auctions used for the daily determination of the LBMA Silver Price are HSBC Bank USA NA, JP Morgan Chase Bank, The Bank of Nova Scotia - ScotiaMocatta, The Toronto Dominion Bank and UBS AG. 

&#160; 

Once the value of the silver has been determined, the Trustee subtracts all accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the value of the silver and all other assets of the Trust. The resulting figure is the net asset value of the Trust. The Trustee determines the NAV by dividing the net asset value of the Trust by the number of Shares outstanding at the time the computation is made. 

&#160; 

Trust Expenses 

&#160; 

The Trust&#8217;s only ordinary recurring expense is expected to be the Sponsor&#8217;s fee. In exchange for the Sponsor&#8217;s fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume the following administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust: the Trustee&#8217;s fee, the Custodian&#8217;s fee, NYSE Arca listing fees, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and expenses, and up to $100,000 per annum in legal fees and expenses. 

&#160; 

The Sponsor&#8217;s fee is accrued daily at an annualized rate equal to 0.50% of the net asset value of the Trust and is payable monthly in arrears. The Trustee will, when directed by the Sponsor, and, in the absence of such direction, may, in its discretion, sell silver in such quantity and at such times as may be necessary to permit payment of the Sponsor&#8217;s fee and of Trust expenses or liabilities not assumed by the Sponsor. The Trustee is authorized to sell silver at such times and in the smallest amounts required to permit such payments as they become due, it being the intention to avoid or minimize the Trust&#8217;s holdings of assets other than silver. Accordingly, the amount of silver to be sold will vary from time to time depending on the level of the Trust&#8217;s expenses and the market price of silver. The Custodian has agreed to purchase from the Trust, at the request of the Trustee, silver needed to cover Trust expenses at a price equal to the price used by the Trustee to determine the value of the silver held by the Trust on the date of the sale. Cash held by the Trustee pending payment of the Trust&#8217;s expenses will not bear any interest. 

&#160; 

The Sponsor earned $25,294,785 for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Deposit of Silver; Issuance of Baskets 

&#160; 

The Trust creates and redeems Shares on a continuous basis, but only in Baskets of 50,000 Shares. Only registered broker-dealers who have entered into written agreements with the Sponsor and the Trustee (each, an &#8220;Authorized Participant&#8221;) can deposit silver and receive Baskets of Shares in exchange. Upon the deposit of the corresponding amount of silver with the Custodian, and the payment of the Trustee&#8217;s applicable fee and of any expenses, taxes or charges (such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees), the Trustee will deliver the appropriate number of Baskets to the Depository Trust Company account of the depositing Authorized Participant. As of the date of this report, Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA), LLC, Goldman Sachs &#38; Co., Goldman Sachs Execution &#38; Clearing L.P., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC., KCG Americas LLC, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley &#38; Co. LLC., SG Americas Securities, LLC, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., UBS Securities LLC, Virtu Financial BD LLC and Virtu Financial Capital Markets, LLC are the only Authorized Participants. The Sponsor and the Trustee maintain a current list of Authorized Participants. Silver deposited with the Custodian must meet the specifications for weight, dimensions, fineness (or purity), identifying marks and appearance of silver bars as set forth in &#8220;The Good Delivery Rules for Gold and Silver Bars&#8221; published by the LBMA. 

&#160; 

Before making a deposit, the Authorized Participant must deliver to the Trustee a written purchase order indicating the number of Baskets it intends to acquire and the location or locations where it expects to make the corresponding deposit of silver with the Custodian. The date the Trustee receives that order determines the amount of silver the Authorized Participant needs to deposit (such amount, the &#8220;Basket Silver Amount&#8221;). However, orders received by the Trustee after 3:59 p.m. (New York time) on a business day are treated as received on the next following business day. The Trustee has entered into an agreement with the Custodian which contains arrangements so that silver can be delivered to the Custodian in England, New York or at other locations that may be authorized in the future. 

&#160; 

If the Trustee accepts the purchase order, it transmits to the Authorized Participant, via facsimile or electronic mail message, no later than 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date such purchase order is received, or deemed received, a copy of the purchase order endorsed &#8220;Accepted&#8221; by the Trustee and indicating the Basket Silver Amount that the Authorized Participant must deliver to the Custodian in exchange for each Basket. Prior to the Trustee&#8217;s acceptance as specified above, a purchase order only represents the Authorized Participant&#8217;s unilateral offer to deposit silver in exchange for Baskets of Shares and has no binding effect upon the Trust, the Trustee, the Custodian or any other party. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Basket Silver Amount necessary for the creation of a Basket changes from day to day. The initial Basket Silver Amount at the time of the creation of the Trust was 500,000 ounces of silver. On each day that NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, the Trustee adjusts the quantity of silver constituting the Basket Silver Amount as appropriate to reflect sales of silver, any loss of silver that may occur, and accrued expenses. The computation is made by the Trustee as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m. (New York time). The Basket Silver Amount so determined is communicated via facsimile or electronic mail message to all Authorized Participants, and made available on the Sponsor&#8217;s website for the Shares. NYSE Arca also publishes the Basket Silver Amount determined by the Trustee as indicated above. 

&#160; 

Because the Sponsor has assumed what are expected to be most of the Trust&#8217;s expenses, and the Sponsor&#8217;s fee accrues daily at the same rate (i . e. , 1/365th of the net asset value of the Trust multiplied by 0.50%), in the absence of any extraordinary expenses or liabilities, the amount of silver by which the Basket Silver Amount decreases each day is predictable. The Trustee intends to make available on each business day, through the same channels used to disseminate the actual Basket Silver Amount determined by the Trustee as indicated above, an indicative Basket Silver Amount for the next business day. Authorized Participants may use that indicative Basket Silver Amount as guidance regarding the amount of silver that they may expect to have to deposit with the Custodian in respect of purchase orders placed by them on such next business day and accepted by the Trustee. The agreement entered into with each Authorized Participant provides, however, that once a purchase order has been accepted by the Trustee, the Authorized Participant will be required to deposit with the Custodian the Basket Silver Amount determined by the Trustee on the effective date of the purchase order. 

&#160; 

No Shares are issued unless and until the Custodian has informed the Trustee that it has allocated to the Trust&#8217;s account (except that any amounts of less than 1,100 ounces may be held in the Trust account on an unallocated basis) the corresponding amount of silver. In accordance with the procedures that the Custodian has agreed to follow in connection with the creation of Shares, silver received by the Custodian no later than 11:30 a.m. (London time) is required to be allocated to the Trust&#8217;s account no later than 9:00 a.m. (New York time) on the next day that the Custodian is open for business at the place of delivery. All taxes incurred in connection with the delivery of silver to the Custodian in exchange for Baskets of Shares (including any applicable value added tax) will be the sole responsibility of the Authorized Participant making such delivery. 

&#160; 

Redemption of Baskets; Withdrawal of Silver 

&#160; 

Authorized Participants, acting on authority of the registered holder of Shares, may surrender Baskets of Shares in exchange for the corresponding Basket Silver Amount announced by the Trustee. Upon the surrender of such Shares and the payment of the Trustee&#8217;s applicable fee and of any expenses, taxes or charges (such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees), the Trustee will deliver to the order of the redeeming Authorized Participant the amount of silver corresponding to the redeemed Baskets. Shares can only be surrendered for redemption in Baskets of 50,000 Shares each. 

&#160; 

Before surrendering Baskets of Shares for redemption, an Authorized Participant must deliver to the Trustee a written request indicating the number of Baskets it intends to redeem and the location where it would like to take delivery of the silver represented by such Baskets. The date the Trustee receives that order determines the Basket Silver Amount to be received in exchange. However, orders received by the Trustee after 3:59 p.m. (New York time) on a business day are treated as received on the next following business day. 

&#160; 

The Custodian may make the silver available for collection at its office or at the office of a sub-custodian if the silver is being held by a sub-custodian. Silver is delivered at the locations designated by the Trustee, in consultation with the Custodian. All taxes incurred in connection with the delivery of silver to an Authorized Participant in exchange for Baskets of Shares (including any applicable value added tax) will be the sole responsibility of the Authorized Participant taking such delivery. 

&#160; 

Unless otherwise agreed to by the Custodian, silver is delivered to the redeeming Authorized Participants in the form of physical bars only (except that any amount of less than 1,100 ounces may be transferred to an unallocated account of or as ordered by, the redeeming Authorized Participant). 

&#160; 

Redemptions may be suspended only (i) during any period in which regular trading on NYSE Arca is suspended or restricted or the exchange is closed (other than scheduled holiday or weekend closings), or (ii) during an emergency as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of silver is not reasonably practicable. 

&#160; 

Fees and Expenses of the Trustee 

&#160; 

Each deposit of silver for the creation of Baskets of Shares and each surrender of Baskets of Shares for the purpose of withdrawing Trust property (including if the trust agreement terminates) must be accompanied by a payment to the Trustee of a fee of $500 (or such other fee as the Trustee, with the prior written consent of the Sponsor, may from time to time announce). 

&#160; 

The Trustee is entitled to reimburse itself from the assets of the Trust for all expenses and disbursements incurred by it for extraordinary services it may provide to the Trust or in connection with any discretionary action the Trustee may take to protect the Trust or the interests of the holders. 

&#160; 

Trust Expenses and Silver Sales 

&#160; 

In addition to the fee payable to the Sponsor, the following expenses are paid out of the assets of the Trust: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

any expenses or liabilities of the Trust that are not assumed by the Sponsor; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

any taxes and other governmental charges that may fall on the Trust or its property; 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; 

expenses and costs of any action taken by the Trustee or the Sponsor to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of holders of Shares; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; 

any indemnification of the Sponsor as described below. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

The Trustee sells the Trust&#8217;s silver from time to time as necessary to permit payment of the fees and expenses that the Trust is required to pay. See &#8220;Trust Expenses.&#8221; 

&#160; 

The Trustee is not responsible for any depreciation or loss incurred by reason of sales of silver made in compliance with the trust agreement. 

&#160; 

Payment of Taxes 

&#160; 

The Trustee may deduct the amount of any taxes owed from any distributions it makes. It may also sell Trust assets, by public or private sale, to pay any taxes owed. Registered holders of Shares will remain liable if the proceeds of the sale are not enough to pay the taxes. 

&#160; 

UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES 

&#160; 

The following discussion of the material United States federal income tax consequences that generally will apply to the purchase, ownership and disposition of Shares by a U.S. Shareholder (as defined below), and certain United States federal income consequences that may apply to an investment in Shares by a Non-U.S. Shareholder (as defined below), is based on the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and judicial and administrative interpretations of the Code, all as in effect on the date of this report and all of which are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. The tax treatment of owners of beneficial interests in the Shares (&#8220;Shareholders&#8221;) may vary depending upon their own particular circumstances. Certain Shareholders (including banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, broker-dealers, traders, Shareholders that are partnerships for United States federal income tax purposes, persons holding Shares as a position in a &#8220;hedging,&#8221; &#8220;straddle,&#8221; &#8220;conversion,&#8221; or &#8220;constructive sale&#8221; transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, persons whose &#8220;functional currency&#8221; is not the U.S. dollar, or other investors with special circumstances) may be subject to special rules not discussed below. In addition, the following discussion applies only to investors who will hold Shares as &#8220;capital assets&#8221; within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code. Moreover, the discussion below does not address the effect of any state, local or foreign tax law on an owner of Shares. Purchasers of Shares are urged to consult their own tax advisers with respect to all federal, state, local and foreign tax law considerations potentially applicable to their investment in Shares. 

&#160; 

For purposes of this discussion, a &#8220;U.S. Shareholder&#8221; is a Shareholder that is: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

an individual who is treated as a citizen or resident of the United States for United States federal income tax purposes; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

a corporation (or entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

an estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for United States federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

a trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or a trust that has made a valid election under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a domestic trust. 

&#160; 

A Shareholder that is not (i) a U.S. Shareholder as defined above or (ii) a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes is considered a &#8220;Non-U.S. Shareholder&#8221; for purposes of this discussion. 

&#160; 

Taxation of the Trust 

&#160; 

The Sponsor and the Trustee will treat the Trust as a &#8220;grantor trust&#8221; for United States federal income tax purposes. In the opinion of Clifford Chance US LLP, special United States federal income tax counsel to the Sponsor, the Trust will be classified as a &#8220;grantor trust&#8221; for United States federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Trust itself will not be subject to United States federal income tax. Instead, the Trust&#8217;s income and expenses will &#8220;flow through&#8221; to the Shareholders, and the Trustee will report the Trust&#8217;s income, gains, losses and deductions to the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) on that basis. The opinion of Clifford Chance US LLP represents only its best legal judgment and is not binding on the IRS or any court. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with the conclusions of counsel&#8217;s opinion and it is possible that the IRS or another tax authority could assert a position contrary to one or all of those conclusions and that a court could sustain that contrary position. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee will request a ruling from the IRS with respect to the classification of the Trust for United States federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to assert successfully that the Trust is not classified as a &#8220;grantor trust,&#8221; the Trust would be classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes, which may affect timing and other tax consequences to the Shareholders. 

&#160; 

The following discussion assumes that the Trust will be classified as a &#8220;grantor trust&#8221; for United States federal income tax purposes. 

&#160; 

Taxation of U.S. Shareholders 

&#160; 

Shareholders will be treated, for United States federal income tax purposes, as if they directly owned a pro rata share of the underlying assets held in the Trust. Shareholders also will be treated as if they directly received their respective pro rata shares of the Trust&#8217;s income, if any, and as if they directly incurred their respective pro rata shares of the Trust&#8217;s expenses. In the case of a Shareholder that purchases Shares for cash, its initial tax basis in its pro rata share of the assets held in the Trust at the time it acquires its Shares will be equal to its cost of acquiring the Shares. In the case of a Shareholder that acquires its Shares as part of a creation of a Basket, the delivery of silver to the Trust in exchange for the underlying silver represented by the Shares will not be a taxable event to the Shareholder, and the Shareholder&#8217;s tax basis and holding period for the Shareholder&#8217;s pro rata share of the silver held in the Trust will be the same as its tax basis and holding period for the silver delivered in exchange therefor. For purposes of this discussion, and unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that all of a Shareholder&#8217;s Shares are acquired on the same date and at the same price per Share. Shareholders that hold multiple lots of Shares, or that are contemplating acquiring multiple lots of Shares, should consult their own tax advisers as to the determination of the tax basis and holding period for the underlying silver related to such Shares. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

When the Trust sells silver, for example to pay expenses, a Shareholder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (a) the Shareholder&#8217;s pro rata share of the amount realized by the Trust upon the sale and (b) the Shareholder&#8217;s tax basis for its pro rata share of the silver that was sold. A Shareholder&#8217;s tax basis for its share of any silver sold by the Trust generally will be determined by multiplying the Shareholder&#8217;s total basis for its share of all of the silver held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale, by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of silver sold, and the denominator of which is the total amount of the silver held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale. After any such sale, a Shareholder&#8217;s tax basis for its pro rata share of the silver remaining in the Trust will be equal to its tax basis for its share of the total amount of the silver held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale, less the portion of such basis allocable to its share of the silver that was sold. 

&#160; 

Upon a Shareholder&#8217;s sale of some or all of its Shares, the Shareholder will be treated as having sold the portion of its pro rata share of the silver held in the Trust at the time of the sale that is attributable to the Shares sold. Accordingly, the Shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale in an amount equal to the difference between (a) the amount realized pursuant to the sale of the Shares, and (b) the Shareholder&#8217;s tax basis for the portion of its pro rata share of the silver held in the Trust at the time of sale that is attributable to the Shares sold, as determined in the manner described in the preceding paragraph. 

&#160; 

A redemption of some or all of a Shareholder&#8217;s Shares in exchange for the underlying silver represented by the Shares redeemed generally will not be a taxable event to the Shareholder. The Shareholder&#8217;s tax basis for the silver received in the redemption generally will be the same as the Shareholder&#8217;s tax basis for the portion of its pro rata share of the silver held in the Trust immediately prior to the redemption that is attributable to the Shares redeemed. The Shareholder&#8217;s holding period with respect to the silver received should include the period during which the Shareholder held the Shares redeemed. A subsequent sale of the silver received by the Shareholder will be a taxable event. 

&#160; 

After any sale or redemption of less than all of a Shareholder&#8217;s Shares, the Shareholder&#8217;s tax basis for its pro rata share of the silver held in the Trust immediately after such sale or redemption generally will be equal to its tax basis for its share of the total amount of the silver held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale or redemption, less the portion of such basis which is taken into account in determining the amount of gain or loss recognized by the Shareholder upon such sale or, in the case of a redemption, is treated as the basis of the silver received by the Shareholder in the redemption. 

&#160; 

Maximum 28% Long-Term Capital Gains Tax Rate for U.S. Shareholders Who Are Individuals 

&#160; 

Under current law, gains recognized by individuals from the sale of &#8220;collectibles,&#8221; including silver, held for more than one year are taxed at a maximum rate of 28%, rather than the current maximum 20% rate applicable to most other long-term capital gains. For these purposes, gain recognized by an individual upon the sale of an interest in a trust that holds collectibles is treated as gain recognized on the sale of collectibles, to the extent that the gain is attributable to unrealized appreciation in value of the collectibles held by the Trust. Therefore, any gain recognized by an individual U.S. Shareholder attributable to a sale of Shares held for more than one year, or attributable to the Trust&#8217;s sale of any silver which the Shareholder is treated (through its ownership of Shares) as having held for more than one year, generally will be taxed at a maximum rate of 28%. The tax rates for capital gains recognized upon the sale of assets held by an individual U.S. Shareholder for one year or less or by a taxpayer other than an individual United States taxpayer are generally the same as those at which ordinary income is taxed. 

&#160; 

3.8% Tax on Net Investment Income 

&#160; 

Certain U.S. Shareholders who are individuals are required to pay a 3.8% tax on the lesser of the excess of their modified adjusted gross income over a threshold amount ($250,000 for married persons filing jointly and $200,000 for single taxpayers) or their &#8220;net investment income,&#8221; which generally includes capital gains from the disposition of property. This tax is in addition to any capital gains taxes due on such investment income. A similar tax will apply to estates and trusts. U.S. Shareholders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the effect, if any, this law may have on their investment in the Shares. 

&#160; 

Brokerage Fees and Trust Expenses 

&#160; 

Any brokerage or other transaction fee incurred by a Shareholder in purchasing Shares will be treated as part of the Shareholder&#8217;s tax basis in the underlying assets of the Trust. Similarly, any brokerage fee incurred by a Shareholder in selling Shares will reduce the amount realized by the Shareholder with respect to the sale. 

&#160; 

Shareholders will be required to recognize the full amount of gain or loss upon a sale of silver by the Trust (as discussed above), even though some or all of the proceeds of such sale are used by the Trustee to pay Trust expenses. Shareholders may deduct their respective pro rata shares of each expense incurred by the Trust to the same extent as if they directly incurred the expense. Shareholders who are individuals, estates or trusts, however, may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of the Trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions. Individuals may deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions only to the extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income. In addition, such deductions may be subject to phase outs and other limitations under applicable provisions of the Code. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Investment by U.S. Tax-Exempt Shareholders 

&#160; 

Certain U.S. Shareholders (&#8220;U.S. Tax-Exempt Shareholders&#8221;) are subject to United States federal income tax only on their &#8220;unrelated business taxable income&#8221; (&#8220;UBTI&#8221;). Unless they incur debt in order to purchase Shares, it is expected that U.S. Tax-Exempt Shareholders should not realize UBTI in respect of income or gains from the Shares. U.S. Tax-Exempt Shareholders should consult their own independent tax advisers regarding the United States federal income tax consequences of holding Shares in light of their particular circumstances. 

&#160; 

Investment by Regulated Investment Companies 

&#160; 

Mutual funds and other investment vehicles which are &#8220;regulated investment companies&#8221; within the meaning of Code section 851 should consult with their tax advisers concerning (i) the likelihood that an investment in Shares, although they are a &#8220;security&#8221; within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;), may be considered an investment in the underlying silver for purposes of Code section 851(b), and (ii) the extent to which an investment in Shares might nevertheless be consistent with preservation of their qualification under Code section 851. 

&#160; 

Investment by Certain Retirement Plans 

&#160; 

Section 408(m) of the Code provides that the purchase of a &#8220;collectible&#8221; as an investment for an individual retirement account (&#8220;IRA&#8221;), or for a participant-directed account maintained under any plan that is tax-qualified under section 401(a) of the Code, is treated as a taxable distribution from the account to the owner of the IRA, or to the participant for whom the plan account is maintained, of an amount equal to the cost to the account of acquiring the collectible. The Trust has received a private letter ruling from the IRS which provides that the purchase of Shares by an IRA or a participant-directed account maintained under a plan that is tax-qualified under section 401(a) of the Code, will not constitute the acquisition of a collectible or be treated as resulting in a taxable distribution to the IRA owner or plan participant under Code section 408(m). However, in the event any redemption of Shares results in the distribution of silver bullion to an IRA or a participant-directed account maintained under a plan that is tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, such distribution would constitute the acquisition of a collectible to the extent provided under section 408(m) of the Code. See &#8220;ERISA and Related Considerations.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders 

&#160; 

A Non-U.S. Shareholder generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax with respect to gain recognized upon the sale or other disposition of Shares, or upon the sale of silver by the Trust, unless (1) the Non-U.S. Shareholder is an individual and is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the sale or other disposition, and the gain is treated as being from United States sources; or (2) the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Shareholder of a trade or business in the United States and certain other conditions are met. 

&#160; 

United States Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 

&#160; 

The Trustee will file certain information returns with the IRS, and provide certain tax-related information to Shareholders, in connection with the Trust. Each Shareholder will be provided with information regarding its allocable portion of the Trust&#8217;s annual income (if any) and expenses. A U.S. Shareholder may be subject to United States backup withholding tax in certain circumstances unless it provides its taxpayer identification number and complies with certain certification procedures. Non-U.S. Shareholders may have to comply with certification procedures to establish that they are not a United States person in order to avoid the information reporting and backup withholding tax requirements. 

&#160; 

The amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against a Shareholder&#8217;s United States federal income tax liability and may entitle such a Shareholder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner. 

&#160; 

Taxation in Jurisdictions Other Than the United States 

&#160; 

Prospective purchasers of Shares that are based in or acting out of a jurisdiction other than the United States are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the tax consequences, under the laws of such jurisdiction (or any other jurisdiction other than the United States to which they are subject), of their purchase, holding, sale and redemption of or any other dealing in Shares and, in particular, as to whether any value added tax, other consumption tax or transfer tax is payable in relation to such purchase, holding, sale, redemption or other dealing. 

&#160; 

ERISA AND RELATED CONSIDERATIONS 

&#160; 

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;) and/or section 4975 of the Code impose certain requirements on employee benefit plans and certain other plans and arrangements, including individual retirement accounts and annuities, Keogh plans, and certain collective investment funds or insurance company general or separate accounts in which such plans or arrangements are invested, that are subject to ERISA and/or the Code (collectively, &#8220;Plans&#8221;), and on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to the investment of assets treated as &#8220;plan assets&#8221; of a Plan. Investments by Plans are subject to the fiduciary requirements and the applicability of prohibited transaction restrictions under ERISA. 

&#160; 

Government plans and some church plans are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the provisions of section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to substantially similar rules under state or other federal law. Fiduciaries of any such plans are advised to consult with their counsel prior to an investment in Shares. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In contemplating an investment of a portion of Plan assets in Shares, the Plan fiduciary responsible for making such investment should carefully consider, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the Plan, the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; discussed below and whether such investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities, including, but not limited to: (a) whether the fiduciary has the authority to make the investment under the appropriate governing plan instrument; (b) whether the investment would constitute a direct or indirect non-exempt prohibited transaction with a party in interest; (c) the Plan&#8217;s funding objectives; and (d) whether under the general fiduciary standards of investment prudence and diversification such investment is appropriate for the Plan, taking into account the overall investment policy of the Plan, the composition of the Plan&#8217;s investment portfolio and the Plan&#8217;s need for sufficient liquidity to pay benefits when due.
