 Item 1. Business 

Overview &#32;

(CNS), a Delaware corporation formed on March 17, 2004, is a global investment manager specializing in liquid real assets, including real estate securities, listed infrastructure, commodities and natural resource equities, as well as preferred securities and other income solutions. Headquartered in New York City, with offices in London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seattle, we serve institutional and individual investors around the world. 

CNS is the holding company for its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Cohen &#38; Steers Capital Management, Inc. (CSCM), Cohen &#38; Steers Securities, LLC (CSS), Cohen &#38; Steers Asia Limited (CSAL), Cohen &#38; Steers UK Limited (CSUK) and Cohen &#38; Steers Japan, LLC (CSJL). CNS and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Company, we, us or our. 

Our revenue is derived primarily from investment advisory fees received from institutional accounts and investment advisory, administration, distribution and service fees received from open-end and closed-end funds. Our fees are based on contractually specified percentages of the value of the managed assets in each client's account. Our revenue fluctuates with changes in the total value of the assets in a client's account and is recognized over the period that the assets are managed. 

At December 31, 2015 , we managed $52.6 billion &#32;in assets - $26.1 billion &#32;in institutional accounts, $17.5 billion &#32;in open-end funds, and $9.0 billion &#32;in closed-end funds. Our assets under management decreased 1% &#32;from $53.1 billion &#32;at December 31, 2014 &#32;as a result of net outflows of $981 million , partially offset by market appreciation of $438 million . 

Investment Vehicles &#32; 

We manage three types of investment vehicles: institutional accounts, open-end funds and closed-end funds. 

Institutional Accounts 

Institutional accounts for which we serve as investment adviser represent portfolios of securities we manage for institutional clients. We manage the assets in each institutional account in accordance with the investment requirements of that client as set forth in such client's investment advisory agreement and investment guidelines. The investment advisory agreements with our institutional account clients are generally terminable at any time. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , investment advisory fees from our institutional accounts totaled approximately $85.5 million , $ 81.9 million &#32;and $81.8 million , respectively, and accounted for 28% , 28% &#32;and 30% , respectively, of our investment advisory and administrative fee revenue. 

Subadvisory assets, which represent accounts for which we have been appointed as a subadvisor by the investment adviser to that vehicle, are included in our institutional account assets. As subadvisor, we are responsible for managing the investments, while the investment adviser oversees our performance as subadvisor; the fund sponsor is responsible for decisions regarding the amount, timing and whether to pay distributions of income for the vehicle to its beneficial owners. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately $18.5 billion &#32;of our institutional account assets were subadvisory assets. 

Open-end Funds 

The open-end funds for which we serve as investment adviser offer and issue new shares continuously as assets are invested and redeem shares when assets are withdrawn. The share price for purchases and redemptions of shares of each of the open-end funds is determined by each fund's net asset value, which is calculated at the end of each business day. The net asset value per share is the current value of a fund's assets less liabilities, divided by the fund's total shares outstanding. 

The investment advisory fees that we receive from the open-end funds for which we serve as investment adviser vary based on each fund's investment strategy, fees charged by other comparable funds and the market in which the fund is offered. In addition, we receive a separate fee for providing administrative services to certain open-end funds at a rate that is designed to reimburse us for the cost of providing these services. The open-end funds pay us a monthly investment advisory fee and an administration fee, if applicable, based on a percentage of the value of the fund's average assets under management. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , investment advisory and administrative fees from open-end funds totaled approximately $136.9 million , $127.4 million &#32;and $114.7 million , respectively, and accounted for 45% , 44% &#32;and 42% , respectively, of our investment advisory and administrative fee revenue. 

Our investment advisory and administration agreements with the U.S. registered open-end funds for which we serve as investment adviser are generally terminable upon a vote of a majority of the fund's board of directors on 60 days' notice, and each investment advisory agreement, including the fees payable thereunder, is subject to annual approval, following the initial two-year term, by a majority of the directors of the fund's board who are not "interested persons," as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act). 

Closed-end Funds 

The closed-end funds for which we serve as investment adviser are registered investment companies that have issued a fixed number of shares through public offerings. These shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and cannot be redeemed by the fund's shareholders. The trading price of the shares is determined by supply and demand in the marketplace, and, as a result, the shares may trade at a premium or discount to the net asset value of the fund. 

The investment advisory fees that we receive from the closed-end funds for which we serve as investment adviser vary based on each fund's investment strategy, fees charged by other comparable funds and prevailing market conditions at the time each closed-end fund initially offered its shares to the public. In addition, we receive a separate fee for providing administrative services to eight of the nine &#32;closed-end funds at a rate that is designed to reimburse us for the cost of providing these services. The closed-end funds pay us a monthly investment advisory fee and an administration fee, if applicable, based on a percentage of the value of the fund's average assets under management. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , investment advisory and administrative fees from closed-end funds totaled approximately $81.4 million , $82.5 million &#32;and $74.6 million , respectively, and accounted for 27% , 28% &#32;and 28% , respectively, of our investment advisory and administrative fee revenue. 

Our investment advisory agreements with each closed-end fund for which we serve as investment adviser are generally terminable upon a vote of a majority of the fund's board of directors on 60 days' notice and are subject to annual approval, following the initial two-year term, by a majority of the directors of the fund's board who are not "interested persons," as defined by the Investment Company Act. 

Portfolio Consulting and Other Services 

We maintain two proprietary indexes, Cohen &#38; Steers Realty Majors Index (RMP) and Cohen &#38; Steers Global Realty Majors Index (GRM). RMP is the basis for the iShares Cohen &#38; Steers REIT ETF sponsored by BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. GRM is the basis for Cohen &#38; Steers Global Realty Majors ETF sponsored by ALPS Fund Services, Inc. and iShares Global Real Estate Index Fund (formerly, Claymore Global Real Estate ETF) sponsored by BlackRock Investments Canada Inc. (formerly, Claymore Investments, Inc.) We earn a licensing fee based on a percentage of the funds' assets for the use of our indexes, which assets, as of December 31, 2015 , were approximately $3.8 billion . While we receive a fee on these assets, they are not included in our reported assets under management. 

We also provide services in connection with model-based strategies (MBS) accounts. As portfolio consultant for a number of MBS accounts, we construct portfolios of securities that fulfill the investment objective of a specified mandate and supply portfolio models on a regular basis. As of December 31, 2015 , we provided such portfolio consulting services to MBS accounts with aggregate assets of $2.4 billion . While we receive a fee on these assets, they are not included in our reported assets under management. 

In addition, we provide several services in connection with assets held by unit investment trusts (UITs). A UIT is a registered investment company that holds a portfolio of securities that generally does not change during the life of the UIT (generally two to five years) except that the sponsor of the UIT may sell portfolio securities under certain narrowly defined circumstances. As portfolio consultant to a number of UITs, we construct a portfolio of securities that we believe is well suited to satisfy the investment objective of the UIT. We also provide ongoing portfolio monitoring services and provide a license to certain firms to use our name in connection with certain of their investment products. At December 31, 2015 , we provided such portfolio consulting services to UITs with aggregate assets of $726 million . While we receive a fee on these assets, they are not included in our reported assets under management. 

Our fee schedules for these services vary based on the type of services. 

Our Investment Strategies 

Each of our investment strategies is overseen by a specialist team, each of which is led by a portfolio manager, or a team of portfolio managers, supported by dedicated analysts. These personnel are located in our New York, Seattle, London and Hong Kong offices. Each team executes fundamentally driven, actively managed investment strategies and each has a unique and well defined process that includes top-down macroeconomic and bottom-up fundamental research and portfolio management elements. These teams are subject to multiple levels of oversight and support from our President and Chief 

Investment Officer, our Chief Administrative Officer-Investments, our Investment Risk Committee, our Investment Operating Committee and our Legal and Compliance Department. Some of our strategies may involve multiple asset classes and are overseen by investment committees led by senior portfolio managers of our specialist teams. 

Below is a summary of our investment strategies: 

Real Assets &#32;invests in a diversified multi-strategy portfolio of companies and securities that generally own or are backed by tangible real assets, including real estate securities, global listed infrastructure, commodities and natural resource equities, with the objective of achieving attractive total returns over the long term, while providing diversification and maximizing the potential for real returns in periods of rising inflation and rising interest rates. 

Real Estate Securities &#32;invests in a portfolio of common stocks and other securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S. real estate companies, including real estate investment trusts (REITs) and similar REIT-like entities. This strategy draws on the expertise of our integrated global real estate securities investment team. 

Global Listed Infrastructure &#32; invests in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. securities issued by infrastructure companies such as utilities, pipelines, toll roads, airports, railroads, marine ports and telecommunications companies located in developed markets with opportunistic allocations to emerging markets. The investment objective is total return. 

MLPs and Midstream Energy &#32; invests in a diversified portfolio of energy-related master limited partnerships (MLPs) and securities of companies that derive revenues or operating income from the exploration, production, gathering, transportation, processing, storage, refining, distribution or marketing of natural gas, crude oil and other energy. The investment objective is total return. 

Commodities invests in a diversified portfolio of exchange-traded commodity future contracts and other commodity-related financial derivative instruments and takes a fundamental, research-driven approach to commodities management, including the ability to short a portion of the portfolio, while seeking alpha through active trade implementation, which may involve employing spread trades while staying fully invested. The investment objective is total return. 

Preferred Securities invests in a diversified portfolio of preferred and debt securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S. companies. The preferred securities are issued by banks, insurance companies, REITs and other diversified financial institutions as well as utility, energy, pipeline and telecommunications companies. We employ a unified investment process that underlies our traditional total return preferred securities strategy as well as the lower duration capital preservation strategies. 

Large Cap Value invests in a diversified portfolio of dividend-paying common stocks and preferred stocks issued by U.S. large capitalization companies that appear to be undervalued but have good prospects for capital appreciation and dividend growth. The investment objective is total return. 

In addition, we offer variations on these strategies that may combine multiple strategies in a single portfolio. Individual portfolios may be customized to comply with client-specific guidelines, benchmarks or risk profiles. Certain portfolios may employ leverage. 

Our Distribution Network 

Our distribution network encompasses the major channels in the asset management industry, including large brokerage firms, registered investment advisers, institutional investors and retirement recordkeepers. The U.S. registered open-end funds for which we serve as investment adviser are available for purchase with and without commissions through full service and discount broker/dealers as well as the significant networks serving financial advisers. Our institutional account clients include corporate and public defined benefit and defined contribution pensions, endowments and foundations and insurance funds.

Competition 

We compete with a large number of global and U.S. investment managers, commercial banks, broker/dealers, insurance companies and other financial institutions. Many competing firms are parts of larger financial services companies and attract business through numerous channels, including retail banking, investment banking and underwriting contacts, insurance agencies and broker/dealers. 

Our direct competitors in wealth management are other funds and exchange-traded-fund (ETF) sponsors, including large nationally recognized investment management firms that have a more diverse product offering and smaller boutique firms that specialize in particular asset classes. We also compete against managers that will manage separate-account portfolios for wealth management clients. In the institutional channel, we compete against a number of investment managers offering similar products and services, from boutique establishments to major commercial and investment banks. 

Performance, price and brand are our principal sources of competition. Prospective clients will typically base their decisions to invest, or continue to invest, with us on our ability to generate returns in excess of a benchmark and the cost of doing so. We are evaluated based on our performance and our fees relative to our competitors. In addition, individual fund shareholders may also base their decision on the ability to access the funds we manage through a particular distribution channel. 

As interest in real assets increases, we may face increased competition from other managers that are competing for the same client base that we serve. Financial intermediaries that offer our products to their clients may also offer competing products. Many of our competitors have greater brand name recognition and more extensive client bases than we do, which could be to our disadvantage. In addition, our larger competitors have more resources and may have more leverage to expand their distribution channels and capture market share through ongoing business relationships and extensive marketing efforts. However, compared to our larger competitors, we may be able to grow our business at a faster rate from a relatively smaller asset base and shift resources in response to changing market conditions more quickly. 

Regulation 

We are subject to regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as applicable laws in the other jurisdictions in which we do business. Violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, temporary or permanent prohibition of engagement in certain activities, reputational harm and loss of clients, suspension of personnel or revocation of their regulatory licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser and/or broker/dealer registrations, or other sanctions and penalties.

In addition, CSCM is a registered commodity trading advisor and a registered commodity pool operator with the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) and is a member of the National Futures Association (the NFA), a futures industry self-regulatory organization.

resources requirements. Such requirements may limit our ability to withdraw capital from CSUK. In addition, CSUK is subject to certain pan European regulations, including MiFID, the Capital Requirements Directive and the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD). MiFID regulates the provision of investment services throughout the European Economic Area and the Capital Requirements Directive regulates capital requirements. AIFMD regulates the management, administration and marketing of alternative investment funds domiciled in or marketed within the European Union and establishes a regime for the cross-border marketing of those funds. 

CSAL, our Hong Kong-based subsidiary, is a registered investment adviser with the SEC and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (the SFC) and is an approved investment manager by the CSSF. CSAL is subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (the SFO), which regulates, among other things, offers of investments to the public and the licensing of intermediaries. CSAL and its employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC. 

In their capacity as U.S. registered investment advisers, CSCM, CSUK and CSAL are subject to the rules and regulations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act). The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including recordkeeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. In addition, our subsidiaries that serve as investment adviser or subadviser to U.S. registered funds are subject to the Investment Company Act, which imposes additional governance, compliance, reporting and fiduciary obligations.

Under certain circumstances, this rule may limit our ability to withdraw capital and receive dividends from CSS. 

Because of the global and integrated nature of our business, regulation applicable to an affiliate in one jurisdiction may affect the operation of affiliates in others or require compliance at a group level.
