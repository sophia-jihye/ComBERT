Overview 

&#160; 

We are a clinical &#8209;stage biopharmaceutical company that is developing innovative drug candidates to make a difference in the lives of patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. We have a portfolio of novel clinical and preclinical compounds that we are developing for a variety of indications: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

CERC-301: Adjunctive Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder. CERC &#8209;301 is currently in Phase 2 development as an oral, adjunctive treatment of patients with major depressive disorder, or MDD, who are failing to achieve an adequate response to their current antidepressant treatment and are severely depressed. We received fast track designation by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in November 2013 for CERC &#8209;301 for the treatment of MDD. CERC &#8209;301 belongs to a class of compounds known as antagonists, or inhibitors, of the N &#8209;methyl &#8209;D &#8209;aspartate, or NMDA, receptor, a receptor subtype of the glutamate neurotransmitter system that is responsible for controlling neurological adaptation. We believe CERC &#8209;301 has the potential to produce a significant reduction in depression symptoms in a matter of days, as compared to weeks or months with conventional therapies, because it specifically blocks the NMDA receptor subunit 2B, or NR2B. We believe this mechanism of action may provide rapid and significant antidepressant activity without the adverse side effect profile of non &#8209;selective NMDA receptor antagonists. Provided we are able to demonstrate efficacy and continued safety in our Phase 2 trial we plan to move forward with Phase 3 development. We may also consider initiating separate development programs in other indications, such as active suicidal ideation. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

CERC-501: Substance Use Disorders and Adjunctive Treatment for MDD. CERC &#8209;501 is currently in Phase 2 development for smoking cessation. CERC-501 is a potent and selective kappa opioid receptor, or KOR, antagonist. KORs are believed to play key roles in modulating stress, mood and addictive behaviors, which form the basis of co-occurring disorders. We intend to develop CERC &#8209;501 for adjunctive treatment of MDD and for substance use disorders (e.g., nicotine, alcohol, and/or cocaine) and have initiated a Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trial in smoking cessation. In addition, two external clinical trials are being conducted evaluating the use of CERC-501 in treating cocaine addiction and mood disorders. One study is being conducted under the auspices of the National Institute of Mental Health, or NIMH, and a second study is being funded by a private foundation. Provided that the outcome of our smoking cessation trial is positive, we plan to conduct a Phase 2 dose-ranging trial in smokers. We are also planning to conduct a Phase 2 trial in inadequately treated patients with MDD. 

&#183; 

CERC-406: Cognitive Impairment. CERC &#8209;406 is our lead preclinical candidate from our proprietary platform of compounds that inhibit catechol &#8209;O &#8209;methyltransferase, or COMT, within the brain, which we refer to as our COMTi platform. We believe CERC &#8209;406 has potential as a treatment of residual cognitive impairment symptoms in patients with MDD. 

&#160; 

Members of our management team have extensive pharmaceutical product development and commercialization experience and they have played key roles in the development or commercialization of Abilify &#174; , BuSpar &#174; , Cymbalta &#174; , Nuplazid&#8482;, Prozac &#174; , Serzone &#174; and Zyprexa &#174; . Collectively, our officers and directors have contributed to the submission of numerous Investigational New Drug Applications, or INDs, and New Drug Applications, or NDAs, to the FDA. 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our goal is to be a leader in the development of innovative drugs that make a difference in the lives of patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. We systematically identify potential product candidates, ideally those for which human proof of concept exists in the intended indication, for either the target or the compound, and for which biomarkers are available to measure therapeutic response. We target conditions where current treatments fail to address unmet medical needs, and where we believe we can apply clinical strategies to increase efficacy signal detection with a view to optimizing the clinical development and regulatory pathway for our product candidates. These strategies include using personalized therapeutic approaches and placebo mitigation techniques. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our strategic objectives include: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Develop and commercialize our lead clinical product candidates, CERC-301 and CERC-501. 

&#160; 

CERC-301: We have initiated a Phase 2 efficacy trial for CERC &#8209;301 in order to evaluate the effect of intermittent oral doses of 12 mg and 20 mg versus placebo. If we are successful in demonstrating efficacy and continued safety in this trial we anticipate moving forward with Phase 3 development. We may consider initiating separate development programs in other indications, such as active suicidal ideation. 

&#160; 

CERC-501: We have initiated a Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trial in smoking cessation, which will provide us with the opportunity to evaluate the effect of 15 mg of CERC &#8209;501 administered orally once per day on tobacco reinstatement behavior and assess subjects&#8217; craving, mood and anxiety during abstinence periods. There are two additional external trials being conducted evaluating the use of CERC &#8209;501 in treating cocaine addiction and mood disorders. One study is being conducted under the auspices of NIMH and a second study is being funded by a private foundation. Provided that the outcome of our smoking cessation trial is positive, we plan to conduct a Phase 2 dose-ranging trial in smokers. We are also planning to conduct a Phase 2 trial in inadequately treated patients with MDD. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Leverage the commercial potential of CERC-301 and CERC-501 by expanding to additional neurological and psychiatric disorders. M any major pharmaceutical companies have deemphasized their neuroscience discovery and development programs in recent years. Given our focus and expertise in developing treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders, these programs represent compelling opportunities for us. We believe we have the ability to identify, evaluate and procure valuable product programs that are consistent with our goal of becoming a leader in the development of innovative drugs that make a difference in the lives of patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. We plan to continue to leverage these opportunities to expand our product candidate portfolio in a fashion that fits within our core strategy and enhances our overall value. Additionally, collaborations, through licenses or strategic partnerships, may provide access to the considerable scientific, development, regulatory and commercial capabilities of larger biopharmaceutical corporations, potentially providing us with additional infrastructure to more efficiently develop and commercialize assets in our product candidate portfolio. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Pursue non-dilutive financing arrangements to fund future development. &#160; We will evaluate opportunities to fund the future development of our clinical and preclinical product candidates, as well as our goal of expansion to additional neurological and psychiatric disorders, via non-dilutive financing arrangements such as government funding and through other collaboration arrangements with strategic partners. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Establish specialty segment commercialization and marketing capabilities in the United States. We intend to selectively retain commercialization rights for certain of our product candidates and to build specialty commercialization capabilities in the United States, which we may complement with co &#8209;promotion agreements with partners. We may also seek to commercialize any of our approved products outside of the United States, although we plan to do so with one or more collaborators. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Use our COMTi Platform to build a pipeline of product candidates for conditions where impaired executive function is a core symptom. By targeting COMT inhibition, we believe we have the potential to address the impairment of executive function in a highly specific manner, guided by biomarkers and pharmacogenomics. We anticipate advancing CERC-406 into preclinical IND-enabling studies and may select additional lead candidates from the library for treatment of various conditions where impaired executive function is a core symptom. In addition to compounds that we may develop on our own, we are exploring early-stage development collaborations with third parties on an indication-specific basis in order to maximize the value of our COMTi platform.

Current Depression Treatment Paradigm and Limitations 

&#160; 

Depression is one of the most common serious medical and psychiatric disorders, with greater than 150 million adults worldwide suffering from MDD at any given time, according to a 2003 report by the World Health Organization, or WHO, titled Investing In Mental Health . According to the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey Replication published in 2007, or the NCS &#8209;R, more than 16 million adults in the United States, which represents approximately 6.7% of its entire adult population, will suffer from a MDD episode in a 12 month period. Furthermore, according to the NCS &#8209;R, approximately 45% of these cases can be classified as severe, and suicide is often a grave complication associated with depression. Studies have shown that approximately 50% to 70% of severely depressed patients have experienced suicidal ideation. Over time, the understanding of psychiatric and neurological disorders, as well as their biological underpinnings, has evolved based on a combination of clinical and preclinical research. Over the past 50 years, many depression therapies and hypotheses have primarily been based on changing the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, in the brain. Manipulating these neurotransmitters impacts mood, but monoamine antidepressants are slow in onset, requiring multiple weeks for patients to obtain a response, and patients may suffer from sexual dysfunction and other side effects from such treatment. 

&#160; 

Numerous studies have shown that many patients do not respond to their initial antidepressant therapy. For example, according to a 2006 report titled Acute and Longer &#8209;Term Outcomes in Depressed Outpatients Requiring One or Several Treatment Steps: A STAR &#8209;D Report , or the STAR &#8209;D Report, which was funded by the NIMH, 51.4% of patients failed to respond, defined as achieving a 50% reduction in symptoms, and only 36.8% became symptom free, or achieved remission, after their initial 12 &#8209;week treatment course with monoamine antidepressants. As such, physicians commonly will switch patients&#8217; antidepressants to manage depression, and patients may require two or three courses of treatment, before achieving satisfactory relief. The depression may persist following a course of treatment and additional medications may need to be used adjunctively. These adjunctive agents may include atypical antipsychotics, like aripiprazole and quetiapine, or other agents such as bupropion, and lithium. While certain patients experience improvement in their depressive symptoms when these additional therapies are added to their existing treatments, many do not. For example, according to a study published by Dr. Robert Berman and others in 2007, entitled The Efficacy and Safety of Aripiprazole as Adjunctive Therapy in Major Depressive Disorder: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double &#8209;Blind, Placebo &#8209;Controlled Study , only 32.4% of patients with treatment resistant depression responded to six weeks of adjunct treatment of the atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole. 

&#160; 

&#160;

According to the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics&#8217; 2012 report titled The Use of Medicines in the United States: Review of 2011 , over 264 million prescriptions totaling $11 billion were filled for depression in the United States in 2011. According to the STAR &#8209;D Report most marketed depression therapies are subject to significant limitations, including: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Time to therapeutic response. Current monoamine antidepressants are slow in onset, allowing depressive symptoms to persist for multiple weeks before patients experience the onset of the drugs&#8217; therapeutic effect or a conclusion can be made that the drug is not working for the patient. Full effect is frequently not seen until 12 weeks. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

High rates of treatment failures and low rates of remission. Even with the widespread availability of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs, MDD remains a leading cause of disability in the world. According to the STAR &#8209;D Report despite four courses of different antidepressant medications, 33% of patients did not achieve remission. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Side effects. Common side effects seen with current depression therapies include gastrointestinal disturbance, dizziness, drowsiness, insomnia and sexual dysfunction. A common symptom of depression is a loss of libido. Compounding this issue, although most side effects associated with SSRIs and SNRIs subside within the first few weeks of treatment, sexual dysfunction often persists throughout the course of treatment. According to the STAR &#8209;D Report, many patients who experience side effects discontinue treatment. In addition, currently used adjunctive treatments include antipsychotic agents which have both efficacy and treatment &#8209;limiting side effects, including weight gain, increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular risk. 

&#160; 

Emergence of NMDA Receptor Antagonists as Antidepressants 

&#160; 

Recently, a new class of antidepressant has emerged known as antagonists of the NMDA receptor, a receptor subtype of the glutamate neurotransmitter system that is responsible for controlling neurological adaptation. Research on ketamine, such as A Randomized Trial of an N methyl D aspartate Antagonist in Treatment Resistant Major Depression study conducted from November 2004 to September 2005 by Dr. Carlos A. Zarate, Jr. and others, has provided evidence that NMDA antagonists can provide significant antidepressant mood effects within 24 hours of administration, acting as rapid acting antidepressants, or RAADs, in MDD and bipolar depression. Moreover, research has also demonstrated that ketamine causes a rapid reduction in suicidal ideation, in contrast to conventional antidepressants that may actually worsen suicidal ideation in children, adolescents, and young adults. We believe efficacy of the class is further supported by the off &#8209;label use of ketamine throughout the United States for treatment resistant bipolar depression and MDD. 

&#160; 

Accumulating evidence, such as that discussed in an article published in 2014 by Ronald Duman and others, titled Neurobiology of Stress, Depression, and Rapid Acting Antidepressants: Remodeling Synaptic Connections , suggests that the antidepressant effect of this new class of antidepressant, as demonstrated by the study of ketamine, is associated with increasing synaptic connections in the brain, which is driven by increases in the synthesis of neuronal proteins. A messenger of this synthetic activity is brain derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, which we believe is increasingly considered to be a biomarker of depression and anti &#8209;depressant effect. BDNF levels have been found to be low in subjects with major depression compared to normal controls, correlate negatively with the severity of depression and recover to levels associated with normal subjects after successful antidepressant treatment. However, non-selective NMDA antagonists such as ketamine have significant limitations. Ketamine is an anesthetic, is not approved for use as an antidepressant, and causes increases in heart rate and blood pressure, hallucinations and other psychological manifestations. In addition, psychiatric use of ketamine may be limited by the need for intravenous administration, the unapproved nature of the use of the drug for the sub chronic treatment of MDD and, as a result, the unknown safety profile, and the need for repeated infusions to maintain a treatment response. Ketamine is scheduled by the Drug Enforcement Administration or DEA, as a Schedule III controlled substance and is prone to abuse. The classification of ketamine as a Schedule III controlled substance means that manufacturers, distributors, and health care providers that handle or prescribe ketamine must, among other things, register with the DEA, keep accurate and complete records, take special precautions to secure the drug and prevent its loss or theft, and may need to periodically file reports with the DEA. These extra regulatory requirements may increase the cost of manufacturing, distributing and prescribing the drug. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Recent research has unveiled new insights into NMDA inhibition and the neurobiology of depression, and points to new classes of antidepressant medications such as antagonists of the NR2B subunit containing NMDA receptors. We believe that NR2B inhibitors, which work on the glutamate system by blocking only NR2B containing NMDA receptors, have the potential to provide rapid and significant antidepressant activity without many of the adverse side effects of ketamine and other non-selective NMDA receptor antagonists, as demonstrated in clinical trial published in 2012, titled Investigational NMDA Receptor Modulators for Depression , conducted by Bernadeta Szewczyk and others. According to a 2013 Decision Resources report, Unipolar Depression, patients suffering from MDD need more effective agents with a faster onset of action, a higher remission rate, better efficacy for comorbid symptoms and a better side effect profile than that of conventional monoamine drugs&#8212;all potential qualities of this new class of antidepressants. 

&#160; 

Our Solution 

&#160; 

CERC &#8209;301 is an oral and specific NR2B antagonist that we are currently developing as a novel oral adjunctive medication for patients with severe MDD who are failing to achieve an adequate response to their current antidepressant treatment. We believe CERC &#8209;301 may have a rapid onset of effect, be well tolerated and have fewer side effects than the leading adjunctive treatments currently available, such as atypical antipsychotics, whose treatment efficacy is hindered by side effects such as weight gain and increased risk of diabetes. We expect that a drug with these attributes would lead to improved compliance and outcomes. We believe an antidepressant with rapid onset of effect would have the potential to provide its greatest benefit by quickly relieving suicidal ideation, a risk factor for suicide. Studies have shown that approximately 50% to 70% of severely depressed patients have experienced suicidal ideation. 

&#160; 

We acquired MK &#8209;0657, which is now known as CERC &#8209;301, from Merck in 2013 through an exclusive worldwide license. We believe that its specific NR2B inhibition has the potential to provide both the rapid antidepressant and suicidality reduction effects of non &#8209;selective NMDA antagonists, without many of their side effects, including increases in heart rate and mental status changes. Preliminary trials of CERC-301 by Merck in healthy subjects failed to demonstrate clinically significant changes in mental status, although modest changes in blood pressure were observed. As discussed in a 2009 article titled Allosteric Modulators of NR2B &#8209;Containing NMDA Receptors: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Potential , there is animal evidence that compounds selectively targeting NR2B receptor subunits, such as CERC &#8209;301, retain many of the beneficial effects while reducing many of the less desirable side effects of other NMDA antagonists. 

&#160; 

We believe CERC &#8209;301 may have some of the following advantages over ketamine and other non &#8209;selective NMDA antagonists: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

minimal, if any, psychotomimetic effects, such as hallucinations and intoxication; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

available in a convenient, oral dosing form suitable for daily or intermittent dosing; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

ability to use for the prevention of a relapse of depression. 

&#160; 

Additionally, we believe that CERC &#8209;301 may have the following advantages over conventional antidepressant therapies and currently approved adjunctive therapies: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

more rapid onset of action, including reduction in suicidality; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

higher rate of response and remission; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

reduced/absent sexual side &#8209;effect profile; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

enhanced safety profile with respect to weight gain and increased risk of diabetes. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We received fast track designation for CERC &#8209;301 in November 2013 for the treatment of MDD. Fast track designation may help facilitate our development of CERC &#8209;301 and expedite the FDA&#8217;s review of our marketing application as it may allow us to have more frequent meetings and correspondence with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of an NDA on a rolling basis before the application is complete.

Current Development Status 

&#160; 

Study Clin301 &#8209;203: A Randomized, Double &#8209;Blind, Placebo &#8209;Controlled Study of Intermittent Doses of CERC &#8209;301 in the Treatment of Subjects with Severe Depression Despite Antidepressant Treatment 

&#160; 

Study Overview: Clin301 &#8209;203 is an ongoing Phase 2 randomized, double blinded placebo &#8209;controlled trial. We will evaluate the antidepressant effect of 12 mg and 20 mg doses of CERC &#8209;301 and ultimately enroll approximately 104 subjects with MDD who are currently experiencing a severe depressive episode despite stable ongoing treatment with either a SSRI or SNRI. This study will enable us to evaluate both the rapid onset of antidepressant effect and the duration of effect of CERC &#8209;301 over a seven and 14 day period after the last administration of the study drug. Enrollment of this trial commenced in August 2015 and we expect to release top-line data in the second half of 2016. 

&#160; 

Study Design: Clin301 &#8209;203 includes two dose administrations seven days apart, followed by 14 days of observation, for a total study duration of 21 days. The primary objective of Clin301 &#8209;203 is to evaluate the antidepressant effect of CERC &#8209;301, in 12 mg and 20 mg dosages, compared to placebo averaged between two and four days&#8217; post &#8209;treatment with study drug, assessed by the 6 &#8209;item unidimensional sub &#8209;set, known as the Bech-6, of the HAMD &#8209;17, a widely used 17-item depression rating scale. This approach is designed to allow detection of acute drug effects as well as duration of drug effect. The key secondary objectives include evaluating the antidepressant effect of CERC &#8209;301 averaged between two and four days&#8217; post &#8209;study drug administration, assessed by the HAMD &#8209;17 and a 7 &#8209;item unidimensional subset of the HAMD &#8209;17 known as the Santen &#8209;7. In addition, the antidepressant effects of CERC &#8209;301 at two, four and seven days after each dose and 14 days after last administration of study drug assessed by the Bech &#8209;6, Santen &#8209;7, HAMD &#8209;17, Clinically Useful Depression Outcome Scale &#8209;Anxiety Self Report, or CUDOS &#8209;A &#8209;SR, and Snaith &#8209;Hamilton Pleasure Scale Self Report, or SHAPS &#8209;SR, will be evaluated. Antidepressant effect will also be assessed using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report, or QIDS &#8209;SR, Clinical Global Impression &#8209;Improvement, or CGI &#8209;I, and CGI &#8209;Severity, or CGI &#8209;S at seven days after each dose and 14 days after last administration of study drug. We will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of intermittent doses of CERC &#8209;301, and the relationship between baseline symptoms and rate/magnitude of response. Qualified site raters will administer clinician &#8209;administered scales and the subjects will administer self &#8209;reported scales. Clin301 &#8209;203 will include a total of nine study visits, with four of the nine visits conducted remotely via telephone in order to mitigate the burden on the subjects. 

&#160; 

Enrollment Strategies: The study is being performed in subjects with MDD currently experiencing a severe depressive episode despite current stable treatment with either a SSRI or SNRI. Subjects are being screened directly from psychiatric clinic referrals, from depression clinical study databases, and from advertising. Potential subjects are being screened by the study sites for all inclusion, exclusion and diagnostic criteria in order to determine eligibility for the study. Subjects are also being screened via an independent third party to determine eligibility. 

&#160; 

Adjunctive Therapy: CERC &#8209;301 is being administered as an adjunctive therapy to current antidepressant treatment in subjects who have failed to adequately respond to their current therapy. We believe that initially pursuing approval as an adjunctive treatment addresses a key unmet medical need while enhancing our ability to achieve appropriate level of pricing, formulary access and reimbursement. 

&#160; 

Future Clinical Development 

&#160; 

Upon completion of Clin301 &#8209;203 we plan to engage the FDA in an end &#8209;of &#8209;phase 2 meeting with the FDA to align plans and activities for potential regulatory approval, which would include Phase 3 clinical trials, non &#8209;clinical NDA enabling studies and manufacturing activities.

Substance Use Disorders 

&#160; 

Drug abuse is a major public health problem that impacts society on multiple levels. According to Results from the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health , a survey conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, in 2013, an estimated 21.6 million persons in the United States aged 12 or older (8.2%) were classified with substance dependence or abuse in the past year based on criteria specified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition. Of these, 2.6 million were classified with dependence or abuse of both alcohol and illicit drugs, 4.3 million had dependence or abuse of illicit drugs but not alcohol, and 14.7 million had dependence or abuse of alcohol but not illicit drugs. Illicit drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription &#8209;type psychotherapeutics (pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives) used nonmedically. Furthermore, in 2013, heavy drinking was reported by 6.3% of the population aged 12 or older, or 16.5 million people. 

&#160; 

Cigarette smoking and exposure to tobacco smoke are the leading causes of preventable disease and death in the United States, resulting in more than 480,000 premature deaths and $289 billion in direct health care expenditures and productivity losses each year. In 2013, 55.8 million persons (21.3% of the population) were current cigarette smokers. Despite progress over the past several decades, millions of adults still smoke cigarettes, the most commonly used tobacco product in the United States, and this continues to be a major public health problem. 

&#160; 

Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder 

&#160; 

Depression is one of the most common serious medical and psychiatric disorders, with greater than 150 million adults worldwide suffering from MDD at any given time, according to a 2003 report by the World Health Organization, or WHO, titled Investing In Mental Health . According to the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey Replication published in 2007, or the NCS &#8209;R, more than 16 million adults in the United States, which represents approximately 6.7% of its entire adult population, will suffer from a MDD episode in a 12 month period. Furthermore, according to the NCS &#8209;R, approximately 45% of these cases can be classified as severe, and suicide is often a grave complication associated with depression. Studies have shown that approximately 50% to 70% of severely depressed patients have experienced suicidal ideation. 

&#160; 

Numerous studies have shown that many patients do not respond to their initial antidepressant therapy. For example, according to a 2006 report titled Acute and Longer &#8209;Term Outcomes in Depressed Outpatients Requiring One or Several Treatment Steps: A STAR &#8209;D Report , or the STAR &#8209;D Report, 51.4% of patients failed to respond, defined as achieving a 50% reduction in symptoms, and only 36.8% became symptom free, or achieved remission, after their initial 12 &#8209;week treatment course with monoamine antidepressants. As such, physicians commonly will switch patients&#8217; antidepressants to manage depression, and patients may require two or three courses of treatment, before achieving satisfactory relief. The depression may persist following a course of treatment and additional medications may need to be used adjunctively. These adjunctive agents may include atypical antipsychotics, like aripiprazole and quetiapine, or other agents such as bupropion and lithium. While certain patients experience improvement in their depressive symptoms when these additional therapies are added to their existing treatments, many do not. For example, according to a study published by Dr. Robert Berman and others in 2007, entitled The Efficacy and Safety of Aripiprazole as Adjunctive Therapy in Major Depressive Disorder: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double &#8209;Blind, Placebo &#8209;Controlled Study , only 32.4% of patients with treatment resistant depression responded to six weeks of adjunct treatment of the atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole. 

&#160; 

Co &#8209;Occurring Disorders 

&#160; 

Without considering nicotine dependence, there are an estimated five million adults in the United States alone who suffer from co &#8209;occurring depression and substance use disorders. Such comorbidities put patients at greater risk. For instance, depending on when MDD onset occurs, MDD has been found to be related to the course of substance dependence, impacting areas such as remission of substance dependence and relapse into substance dependence after 

&#160;

stable remission. Recent research suggests that a history of MDD is associated with a decreased ability to quit smoking and MDD over the last year is associated with an increased likelihood of smoking relapse. One common link between the co &#8209;occurrence of depression and substance use disorders may be stress. Sustained stressful experiences can induce despair and increase the risk of clinical depression and substance use. Stress and mood are significant components of addiction relapse as discussed in a 2000 article written by Watkins et al., titled Neural Mechanisms Underlying Nicotine Addiction: Acute Positive Reinforcement and Withdrawal published by the Journal of Nicotine &#38; Tobacco Research. Substance use often provides relief from stress, such that the substance of abuse often becomes a potent behavioral reinforcer. Present pharmacologic treatments for co &#8209;occurring disorders consist either of treatment for the psychiatric disorder or the treatment for the addiction, but not the treatment of the underlying connection between the two. For example, the non-selective opioid antagonist naltrexone, an FDA &#8209;approved medication for alcohol dependence in patients who are able to abstain from alcohol in an outpatient setting prior to treatment initiation, is not FDA approved as an antidepressant or an antianxiety agent. The smoking cessation aid varenicline, a mixed nicotinic agent, is associated with depression as a serious side effect. Similarly, antidepressant medication exerts a modest beneficial effect for patients with combined depressive and substance &#8209;use disorders. It is not a stand &#8209;alone treatment, and concurrent therapy directly targeting the addiction is also indicated, according to a 2004 review written by Nunes and Levin titled Treatment of Depression in Patients with Alcohol or Other Drug Dependencies: A Meta &#8209;analysis, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). Therefore, we believe a significant unmet need exists for pharmacotherapies effective in the treatment of co &#8209;occurring disorders. 

&#160; 

Mood, Stress, Addiction and Kappa Opioid Receptors 

&#160; 

Kappa opioid receptors, or KORs, and their native ligand dynorphin are localized in areas of the brain which effect reward and stress and are believed to impact mood, stress and addictive disorders. As discussed in a paper by Shippenberg et al., titled Dynorphin and the Pathophysiology of Drug Addiction and published in the Journal of Pharmacology and Therapeutics in 2007, both KORs and dynorphin, together comprising the kappa opioid system, are upregulated by stress and chronic exposure to drugs of abuse, are thought to mediate the negative emotional states seen in drug withdrawal and contribute to stress &#8209;induced reinstatement of drug seeking behavior. In animal models it has been observed that stress produces a depressive state that is believed to be associated with the activation of KOR and subsequent downstream signaling events. Administration of agents that stimulate the KOR system, or KOR agonists, that act like dynorphin, decrease dopamine levels in areas of the brain involved with executive function, produce anxiety &#8209;like and depression &#8209;like behaviors in animals, exacerbate behaviors associated with drug withdrawal and increase the reinforcing effects of substances of abuse. 

&#160; 

KOR Antagonism 

&#160; 

Much of the current knowledge of the kappa opioid system comes from studies of two prototypical KOR antagonists, nor &#8209;BNI and JDTic. In studies, such as those discussed by Lalanne et al. in a paper titled The Kappa Opioid Receptor from Addiction to Depression and Back and published in Frontiers in Psychiatry in 2014, KOR antagonists induced antidepressant &#8209;like effects in animal models and attenuated symptoms associated with withdrawal, such as anxiety behaviors. The therapeutic potential of KOR antagonism has been suggested in animal models of anhedonia, depression, and anxiety, and KOR antagonists reduced the signs of nicotine, heroin and alcohol withdrawal in rodent models of dependence. In these studies, stress &#8209;induced reinstatement to drug seeking was blunted in mice who had their KOR system genetically deleted, and was also blocked in wild &#8209;type mice by treatment with nor &#8209;BNI and rats treated with JDTic. In the studies summarized by Lalanne et al., KOR antagonists reduced ethanol intake in a number of animal models. Overall, we believe the preclinical data to date support the emerging consensus that selective kappa opioid antagonists may have antidepressant &#8209; and antianxiety &#8209; like effects, reduce addictive substance consumption, and reduce behaviors and signs of drug withdrawal. These studies provide the basis for further evaluation of the use of KOR antagonists, like CERC-501, in mood and substance use disorders, including co-occurring disorders. 

&#160; 

Our Solution 

&#160; 

In February 2015, we acquired rights to CERC &#8209;501, which was previously referred to as LY2456302 and OpRA Kappa, through an exclusive, worldwide, license from Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly. CERC &#8209;501 is a high &#8209;binding, selective KOR antagonist. We believe that the availability of a selective, potentially well tolerated and oral 

&#160;

kappa antagonist like CERC &#8209;501 represents a unique drug development opportunity for substance use disorders, adjunctive treatment of MDD and potentially for co &#8209;occurring disorders. 

&#160; 

We believe CERC &#8209;501 may have the following advantages over conventional antidepressant and addiction therapies: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

highly specific and selective to KOR and, therefore, minimal off &#8209;target pharmacology; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

available in convenient, once &#8209;a &#8209;day oral dosing; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

rapid onset of action; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

potential efficacy against substance use disorders; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

potential efficacy against mood disorders; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

potential ability to treat co &#8209;occurring disorders. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our Program 

&#160; 

Current Development Status 

&#160; 

In the long term, we intend to target our development efforts at the treatment of co &#8209;occurring disorders, an under &#8209;served segment of patients. We believe CERC &#8209;501 has potential as a treatment for substance use disorders, as a once &#8209;a &#8209;day, oral adjunctive treatment of MDD, and as a treatment for co &#8209;occurring disorders. We further believe that CERC &#8209;501 may have the ability to provide rapid onset of antidepressant effect. As discussed below, we plan to leverage the external studies funded and conducted by third parties with our own internally funded clinical trials to evaluate the potential human utility of CERC-501 in smoking dependence, depression, cocaine dependence, and anhedonia and mood disorders. 

&#160; 

Study Clin501 &#8209;201: A Randomized, Double &#8209;Blind, Placebo &#8209;Controlled, Crossover Design Study of CERC &#8209;501 in a Human Laboratory Model of Smoking Cessation . 

&#160; 

Study Overview: Clin501 &#8209;201 is designed as a randomized, placebo &#8209;controlled double blind cross &#8209;over human laboratory study to evaluate the effects of 15 mg of CERC &#8209;501 on tobacco withdrawal and reinstatement and assess craving, mood and anxiety during 18 hours of abstinence in 66 heavy cigarette smokers. Clin501 &#8209;201 uses a placebo and a crossover design with two periods. We believe that the cross &#8209;over design, by allowing for subjects to be their own control, significantly increases trial power as does the conduct of the study in a controlled laboratory environment. 

&#160; 

Study Design: Clin501 &#8209;201 consists of two periods. After the screening period of up to 21 days, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to a regimen of 15 mg or placebo. Each period consists of a seven day treatment period followed by a single testing day on Day 8. Subjects will participate in a laboratory session following the McKee Smoking Lapse Test and will be discharged from the clinic to undergo drug washout followed by the second period of the cross &#8209;over design. The McKee Smoking Lapse Test involves nicotine deprivation for 18 hours, beginning on the evening of the seventh day, and continuing to mid &#8209;day of the eighth day, followed by a delay period, 50 minutes in duration, and a self &#8209;administration period, 60 minutes in length, as described in more detail below. 

&#160; 

The smoking lapse test involves assessment of tobacco craving, mood ratings and nicotine withdrawal after 18 hours of abstinence followed by the delay period where subjects are presented with a tray containing their preferred brand of cigarettes and an ashtray. Subjects will be instructed that they can begin smoking at any point over the next 50 minutes. However, for each five minute block of time a subject delays smoking, the subject will receive a financial reward. The time will be recorded when a subject announces that the subject wants to smoke. After their first cigarette or 

&#160;

the completion of the delay period, a standardized scale known as the modified Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire (mCEQ), will be administered to assess satisfaction, psychological reward, craving relief, enjoyment of airway sensations and other subjective effects associated with smoking. Upon smoking the first cigarette or completion of the delay period, the smoking self &#8209;administration period begins, and lasts 60 minutes. Subjects will be provided with eight cigarettes of their preferred brand. Money earned for delaying smoking will be paid to the subjects at the end of each laboratory session. The number of cigarettes smoked will be recorded. The primary endpoints for the study are latency (the number of minutes and seconds) to the start of tobacco use during the delay period and the number of cigarettes smoked during the self &#8209;administration period. 

&#160; 

Upon completion of the McKee Smoking Lapse Test, subjects will be discharged and begin a seven to ten day washout period. Subjects will then return to the clinic to begin the second period of the cross &#8209;over design to receive placebo or 15 mg CERC-501, respectively, and repeat the above procedures and assessments. Upon discharge from the unit after the second period, subjects will be instructed to return for a final follow &#8209;up visit seven days later. 

&#160; 

Enrollment Strategies: The study will be performed in volunteer subjects who are heavy cigarette smokers currently not seeking treatment. Recruitment is ongoing and subjects will be compensated for their participation in the study. 

&#160; 

Overview of Externally Funded and Conducted Studies 

&#160; 

In connection with our in &#8209;license of CERC &#8209;501 from Lilly, we expect to receive the results of two external clinical trials that are currently enrolling subjects. One of these studies is funded by a grant from the NIMH and the other is privately-funded without any cost to us. The following is a summary of these two clinical trials: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Impact of the KOPr Antagonist OpRA Kappa in Persons at Specific Stages of Cocaine Addiction Trajectory, Versus Normal Volunteers . This single site trial, which began in September 2014, is being conducted under the leadership of Mary Jeanne Kreek, MD, Professor and Head of Laboratory, The Rockefeller University, and Senior Physician, The Rockefeller University Hospital. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

A Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Kappa Opioid Receptor As a Target for the treatment of Mood and Anxiety Spectrum Disorders by Evaluation of Whether LY2456302 Engages Key Neural Circuitry Related to the Hedonic Response. Dr. Andrew Krystal of Duke University Medical Center serves as the principal investigator of this 6 site clinical study, which began in 2015. 

&#160; 

Depending on the results of Phase 2 studies for CERC-501, we may consider conducting or sponsoring one or both of these trials. In January 2016, the National Institutes of Health discontinued an ongoing Phase 2 trial for CERC-501 for treatment-resistant depression, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled, Proof-of-Concept (POC) Trial of LY246302, a Kappa Selective Opioid Receptor Antagonist, and Augmentation of Antidepressant Therapy in Treatment-Resistant Depression, which was being funded by the NIMH, due to slow study progression. 

&#160; 

Future Clinical Development 

&#160; 

Upon completion of Clin501 &#8209;201, provided the results are indicative of potential efficacy and safety, we plan to conduct a dose ranging Phase 2 study in nicotine dependent smokers. In addition, funding permitting we are considering conducting a Phase 2 clinical study in inadequately treated subjects with major MDD currently on antidepressants. We will also monitor the results from externally funded CERC-501 studies and based on the outcome of those clinical trials determine the merits of pursuing indications for adjunctive treatment of MDD, substance use disorders, and, depending on marketing approval, the treatment of co &#8209;occurring disorders. We also plan to engage the FDA in an end &#8209;of &#8209;Phase 2 meeting to align plans and activities for potential regulatory approval, which would include Phase 3 clinical studies, non &#8209;clinical NDA enabling studies and manufacturing activities. 

&#160; 

&#160;

COMTi Platform 

&#160; 

In 2013, we acquired rights to our COMTi platform by means of an exclusive, worldwide license from Merck. COMT is an enzyme that is critical for the inactivation and metabolism of dopamine and its inhibition in the brain has potential applicability in treating subjects with neuropsychiatric conditions, including MDD, schizophrenia, Parkinson&#8217;s disease and pathological gambling. We believe compounds from this platform increase dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex, or PFC, which is the region of the brain that is responsible for working memory, attention tasks and decision making, all of which are human attributes that we collectively refer to as executive function. We have selected CERC &#8209;406 as our first preclinical candidate from the COMTi platform. We anticipate establishing the data set necessary to select additional preclinical lead candidates for treatment of various conditions where impaired executive function is a core symptom. These programs will target the improvement of working memory and executive function, which are key components of cognition. 

&#160; 

COMT Overview 

&#160; 

The neurotransmitter systems that are involved in executive function include acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, glutamate and histamine. Most of these targets have a wide ranging impact on different brain functions or areas, and accordingly, most drug development efforts targeting these systems are fraught with the lack of specificity of clinical effect of the drugs tested. On the other hand, higher &#8209;order cognitive functions, which impact areas such as thought, are governed by dopamine in the PFC. COMT is thought to break down dopamine and regulate dopamine levels in the PFC and we believe that brain COMT inhibition is a preferred target for treatment of cognitive impairment in conditions where loss of executive function is a key symptom. Specifically, COMT inhibition has potential applicability in the significant improvement of aspects of executive function in persons suffering from schizophrenia, Parkinson&#8217;s disease and pathological gambling. 

&#160; 

We believe brain COMT inhibition is a target with two key attributes that facilitate drug development&#8212;genetic variability and the availability of biomarkers. A genetic variation in the COMT enzyme, the Val allele, enhances the enzyme&#8217;s baseline level activity and has been observed to be linked to reduced aspects of executive function in healthy volunteers and in disorders associated with cognitive impairment. We believe that targeting this genotype might produce a significant improvement in magnitude and reliability of drug response when used as an adjunctive to other treatments. 

&#160; 

The second attribute involves the use of biomarkers to monitor the level of enzyme inhibition by our novel COMT inhibitors. In cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, the inhibition of COMT leads to an increase in the amounts of dihydroxyphenylacetic, or DOPAC, and a decrease in the amounts of homovanillic acid, or HVA. Samples of CSF may be easily obtained in clinical studies via a spinal tap, or lumbar puncture, to measure concentrations of HVA and DOPAC. This facilitates immediate measures of central dopamine breakdown. 

&#160; 

Our COMTi platform comprises COMT inhibitors with selectivity for membrane bound COMT, the dominant form of COMT found within the central nervous system. We believe these potent COMT inhibitors may selectively increase dopamine levels in the PFC, thereby improving executive function. We believe our selective COMT inhibitors may avoid off &#8209;target toxicity and side effects seen with the previous generation of COMT inhibitors, such as liver toxicity observed in tolcapone and diarrhea observed with entacapone and tolcapone. Our novel COMT inhibitors are intended to have higher levels of penetration and selectivity for brain COMT, which we believe may lead to higher efficacy with lower administered doses. Our COMTi platform includes compounds with varying degrees of selectivity of peripheral versus brain COMT inhibition, including some that work on both peripheral and brain COMT, and some that work primarily on brain COMT. We believe this provides options for developing different compounds for different disease states. For example, we believe a COMTi for Parkinson&#8217;s disease may need to provide both central and peripheral inhibition, in order to benefit both to the movement impairments of Parkinson&#8217;s disease and the cognitive symptoms of the disease.

&#160; 

Residual Cognitive Impairment Symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder 

&#160; 

Several publications including the 2014 article by Lam et al., titled Cognitive Dysfunction in MDD: Effects on Psychosocial Functions and Implications for Treatment published in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry indicate that cognitive dysfunction is an important mediator of disability in MDD. Self &#8209;perceived cognitive impairment has always been recognized as a clinical manifestation of MDD. Cognitive domains that are measurably impaired in MDD include attention, memory, processing speed and executive function. As discussed by Lam et al., up to 50% of patients with MDD exhibit measureable cognitive deficits. Deficits in attention and executive function may persist even after remission. Cognitive dysfunction and functional impairments are two of the most common residual complaints among patients with MDD who achieve symptomatic remission. In a study of patients with MDD treated with antidepressants for at least three months who were considered to be in partial or complete remission, 30% to 50% reported residual cognitive symptoms that interfered with functioning. Thus, we believe cognitive dysfunction may represent a dimension of MDD that is independent of mood symptoms. Although standard antidepressants may improve cognitive deficits in MDD, we believe these effects may be limited in magnitude. We believe there is a subgroup of patients who require additional treatment alternatives. According to Lam et.al, accumulating clinical evidence suggests that cognitive dysfunction is a core psychopathological feature of the disorder. 

&#160; 

Entacapone and tolcapone are two commercially available COMT inhibitors used to treat aspects of Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Both drugs inhibit COMT outside of the nervous system, or peripheral COMT, and may be administered, with levodopa, which is the precursor to the neurotransmitter dopamine, multiple times per day. Tolcapone, which has modest brain penetration and inhibits brain COMT, is hampered by side effects including diarrhea and liver toxicity. Entacapone does not penetrate the brain. Because of these factors, neither drug is used clinically to treat executive function impairment. Nonetheless, pilot studies using tolcapone have repeatedly suggested an improvement in aspects of executive function in normal volunteers and in subjects with various conditions that are associated with cognitive impairment. Improvements in aspects of the underlying conditions were also found. 

&#160; 

Our Solution 

&#160; 

CERC &#8209;406 is a small, orally active molecule and is a selective COMT inhibitor with low inhibitory activity on peripheral COMT. We are anticipating to develop CERC &#8209;406 as an oral adjunctive medication for patients with residual cognitive impairment symptoms suffering from MDD. We selected CERC &#8209;406 as our lead preclinical candidate from our COMTi platform because in preclinical testing we observed that it had lower potential of peripheral, off target side effects, rapid absorption and bioavailability, good brain penetration and a favorable dose &#8209;dependent biomarker profile in rats. We have also observed that CERC &#8209;406 has an off &#8209;rate on brain COMT that is slower than tolcapone, potentially implying a good duration of effect. In preclinical studies it appears that CERC &#8209;406 may have favorable drug distribution and metabolism properties, suggesting that it has the potential to be administered orally on a once or twice daily basis. 

&#160; 

We believe that CERC &#8209;406 may: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

demonstrate efficacy as it is a brain penetrant COMT inhibitor with selectivity for MB &#8209;COMT to target the PFC dopamine deficit in this patient population; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

be more effective in Val homozygotes population, who have higher levels of COMT activity and lower prefrontal dopamine receptor activation; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

be safer than existing COMT inhibitors&#8212;existing COMT inhibitors are not ideal as such inhibitors have adverse events such as liver toxicity and diarrhea. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Program 

&#160; 

We are anticipating to develop CERC &#8209;406 for the enhancement of executive function and working memory in MDD, where we believe a new therapy with efficacy in residual cognitive symptoms may be associated with improved functional outcomes. 

&#160; 

Current Development Status 

&#160; 

We anticipate to advance the characterization of the safety and efficacy of CERC &#8209;406 in preclinical animal studies, to advance manufacturing of product for potential clinical trials, and to file an IND for CERC &#8209;406. 

&#160; 

Other Business Development Activities 

&#160; 

From time to time we may consider strategic transactions, such as acquisitions of companies, asset purchases and in &#8209;licensing of products, product candidates or technologies. Additional potential transactions that we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements, including strategic partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, business combinations and investments. We believe we have the ability to identify, evaluate and procure valuable product programs that are consistent with our goal of becoming a leader in the development of innovative drugs that make a difference in the lives of patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. We plan to continue to evaluate these opportunities to expand our product candidate portfolio in a fashion that fits within our core strategy and enhances our overall value. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technology and other inventions that are important to our business. As more fully described below, we have issued patents covering the compounds and compositions of CERC &#8209;301 and CERC &#8209;501. We have also filed multiple patent applications directed to COMT inhibitor compounds and methods of use. In 2014 and 2015, we received Notices of Allowance for two U.S. patent applications that broadly and/or specifically cover current compounds of interest within the COMTi Platform, including CERC &#8209;406. Both of the allowed U.S. applications issued as patents in 2015. We also may rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 

&#160; 

Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know &#8209;how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know &#8209;how, continuing technological innovation and in &#8209;licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of central nervous system disorders. 

&#160; 

The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. 

&#160; 

Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention or in post &#8209;grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions, that 

&#160;

challenge priority of invention or other features of patentability. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. 

&#160; 

The patent portfolios for our most advanced programs are summarized below. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

CERC &#8209;301. We possess worldwide exclusive rights to manufacture, use and sell certain NR2B antagonist compounds. The CERC &#8209;301 patent portfolio consists of three patent families. The first family consists of patents that have issued in the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Great Britain, Switzerland and Japan. The patents in the first family include composition of matter and use claims of varying scope, including picture claims to CERC &#8209;301 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The expiration date of the U.S. patent in the first family is August 31, 2026, not including any patent term extension or market exclusivity period which may apply. The second family consists of patents that have issued in the United States, Germany, France and Great Britain. The patents in the second family include composition of matter claims (in U.S. patent only) and use claims that generically cover CERC &#8209;301. The expiration date of the U.S. patent is June 3, 2022, not including any potential patent term extension or market exclusivity period. The third family consists of a U.S. provisional patent application which includes claims to compositions of matter, methods of use, and methods of manufacture. U.S. nonprovisional and international patent applications that claim priority to the provisional application were filed in December 2015. Any patent issuing from the U.S. nonprovisional applications would expire in 2035 at the earliest, not including any potential patent term extension or market exclusivity period. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

CERC &#8209;501. We possess worldwide exclusive rights to manufacture, use and sell certain KOR antagonist compounds. The CERC &#8209;501 patent portfolio consists of a single patent family with dozens of issued patents and pending patent applications, including patents issued in the U.S., Australia, Canada, China, Europe and Japan. The patents in this family include composition of matter claims, including picture claims to CERC &#8209;501 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and/or use claims of varying scope. The expiration date of the two U.S. patents is January 13, 2029, not including any potential patent term extension or market exclusivity period. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

CERC &#8209;406 and COMTi Platform. We possess worldwide exclusive rights to manufacture, use and sell COMT inhibitor compounds. The COMT patent portfolio includes three patent families. Each patent family consists of patent applications filed in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico and Russia. Any patents issuing from these patent applications are predicted to expire at the earliest in 2031, not including any potential patent term extension or market exclusivity period. In 2014 and 2015, we received Notices of Allowance for two U.S. patent applications that broadly and/or specifically cover current compounds of interest within the COMTi Platform, including CERC &#8209;406. Both of the allowed U.S. applications issued as patents in 2015. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

FP01. On March 17, 2015, we provided notice to Johns Hopkins University that we were terminating the exclusive, worldwide license to develop and market FP01 in chronic, persistent cough effective June 15, 2015. We no longer have any rights to the previously-licensed intellectual property concerning FP01. 

&#160; 

The term of any individual patent depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries where we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non &#8209;provisional patent application. 

&#160; 

In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA &#8209;approved drug that contains an active ingredient or salt or ester of the active ingredient that has not previously been marketed may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration to account for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch &#8209;Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is based upon one half of the time between the IND effective date and a company&#8217;s initial submission of a marketing application, plus the entire time between the submission of the marketing application and the FDA&#8217;s approval of the application. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be 

&#160;

extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non &#8209;United States jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those product candidates. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. 

&#160; 

For all of our product candidates, we intend to explore at each stage of the drug discovery process opportunities for follow &#8209;on patent filings to maximize patent terms and market exclusivities. Such follow &#8209;on patent filings may be directed to new indications, formulations, combination therapies, manufacturing methods, dosages, routes of administration, patient populations, contraindications, drug interactions (or absence of interactions) or other aspects of drug labels. 

&#160; 

We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual&#8217;s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing and Clinical Research 

&#160; 

We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We rely on contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce our drug candidates in accordance with applicable provisions of the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, regulations for use in our clinical studies. The manufacture of pharmaceuticals is subject to extensive GMP regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control. 

&#160; 

CERC &#8209;301 

&#160; 

We currently purchase the active ingredient of CERC &#8209;301 tablets, which is available from multiple sources, from one supplier. Xcelience currently manufactures the drug product for clinical testing. We intend to identify and qualify multiple manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product and fill &#8209;and &#8209;finish services prior to submission of a new drug application to the FDA. We have entered into multiple contract service agreements with providers of administrative, data capture, management, monitoring and statistical analysis services relating to our Clin301 &#8209;203 study. We will remain substantially responsible for overseeing and managing the conduct of the Clin301 &#8209;203 study, with separate agreements with investigative sites performing the study, other clinical research organizations and other third &#8209;party vendors. 

&#160; 

CERC &#8209;501 

&#160; 

As part of the exclusive license agreement with Lilly, we assumed all accountability and responsibility for existing drug substance, drug product and packaged clinical trial material of CERC &#8209;501, as well as all future manufacturing of CERC &#8209;501 for development and commercialization. Currently, clinical trial material necessary for supplying the existing studies for CERC &#8209;501 are warehoused with one supplier, BioConvergence LLC, or BioConvergence. BioConvergence is a provider of a comprehensive range of services extending from pharmaceutical and clinical development through production and testing to commercialization of product. We intend to identify and 

&#160;

qualify multiple manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product and fill &#8209;and &#8209;finish services prior to submission of a new drug application to the FDA. 

&#160; 

All of our drug candidates are small molecule compounds and are manufactured in reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry is amenable to scale up and does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. 

&#160; 

License Agreements 

&#160; 

Merck CERC &#8209;301 License 

&#160; 

In 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Merck pursuant to which Merck granted us rights relating to certain small molecule compounds which are known to inhibit or antagonize the activity of the NR2B receptor as its primary mechanism of action and any pharmaceutical product containing such compounds, or an NR2B Product, for the prevention, diagnosis and/or treatment of all disease in humans. Merck retained a co &#8209;exclusive right to conduct non &#8209;human and non &#8209;clinical research under patents for the licensed NR2B antagonist compounds and NR2B Products. In addition to the license grant, Merck agreed that for a period of three years from the effective date of the license agreement that it would not, either by itself or through collaboration with a third party, develop, manufacture or commercialize anywhere any product comprising an NR2B antagonist compound. 

&#160; 

In connection with the license grant of certain NR2B antagonist compounds and NR2B Products, we granted Merck a right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive, worldwide license and/or other worldwide rights to research, develop, commercialize, sell and/or offer for sale any such NR2B Product. Pursuant to such right of first negotiation, we must provide advance notice to Merck if we intend to offer a license of any kind, or to assign or transfer or otherwise convey any other rights related to the development or commercialization of an NR2B Product. If Merck either chooses not to exercise its right of first negotiation or we fail to enter into an agreement with Merck as provided in the agreement, we will be free to enter into negotiations and contract with third parties with respect to such NR2B Product and will have no further obligation to Merck regarding such NR2B Product. In November 2013, we provided notice to Merck of our intent to potentially license or transfer CERC &#8209;301 and, after evaluating, Merck ultimately decided not to exercise its right of first negotiation with respect to CEC &#8209;301. As a result, pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, Merck no longer has, and we no longer have an obligation to provide, a right of first negotiation to Merck with respect to CERC &#8209;301. 

&#160; 

In consideration of the license, we are required to make an initial aggregate payment of $1.5 million. We made an initial payment of $750,000 pursuant to the terms of the license within 45 days of the execution of the license agreement. The balance of the initial payment is due upon the later of (i) FDA acceptance of Merck preclinical data and (ii) FDA acceptance of data from a study that results in the FDA approving a Phase 3 clinical trial for an NR2B Product candidate. For each NR2B Product we develop, we are required to make milestone payments in an amount not to exceed, in the aggregate, $40.5 million upon the achievement of various development and regulatory milestones, including first commercial sale. Additionally, we are required to make sales milestone payments in an amount not to exceed $15.0 million. Upon commercialization of an NR2B Product, we will pay Merck a royalty in the high single digits on net sales of NR2B Product. The royalty obligation will be on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis until the later of (i) the expiration of the last to expire valid patent claim of a patent licensed to us under the license agreement covering the NR2B Product in such country, and (ii) ten years from the first commercial sale of the NR2B Product in such country. 

&#160; 

Our license agreement with Merck will remain in effect on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis until our obligation to pay royalties under the license agreement expire with respect to such product in such country. Upon expiration of the license agreement with respect to a product in a country, our license grant for such product in such country will become a fully paid &#8209;up, royalty &#8209;free, irrevocable, perpetual non &#8209;exclusive license. 

&#160; 

We have the unilateral right to terminate the license agreement in its entirety without cause upon 90 days prior written notice to Merck. Either party may terminate the license agreement in its entirety in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party, upon the other party&#8217;s filing or institution of bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation 

&#160;

or receivership proceeding or upon an assignment of a substantial portion of its assets for the benefit of creditors. Merck may terminate the license agreement with respect to a particular patent licensed to us if we challenge the validity or enforceability of such patent. If Merck terminates the agreement for cause, or if we exercise our right to terminate the agreement without cause, the rights granted to us under this license will revert to Merck. 

&#160; 

Lilly CERC &#8209;501 License 

&#160; 

In February 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Lilly pursuant to which Lilly granted us rights relating to certain small molecule compounds which are potent and selective KOR antagonists and any pharmaceutical product containing such compounds, or a KOR Product, for the prevention, diagnosis and/or treatment of all disease in humans. In connection with the license grant of certain KOR antagonist compounds and KOR Products, we granted Lilly a right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive, worldwide license and/or other worldwide rights to develop or commercialize any such KOR Product. Pursuant to such right of first negotiation, we must provide advance notice to Lilly if we intend to offer a license of any kind, or to assign or transfer or otherwise convey any other rights related to the development or commercialization of a KOR Product. If Lilly either chooses not to exercise its right of first negotiation or we fail to enter into an agreement with Lilly as provided in the agreement, we will be free to enter into negotiations and contract with third parties with respect to such KOR Product and will have no further obligation to Lilly regarding such KOR Product. 

&#160; 

In consideration of the license, we are required to make an initial aggregate payment of $1.0 million. We made an initial payment of $750,000 pursuant to the terms of the license within 30 days of the execution of the license agreement. The balance of the initial payment is due 30 days after completion of the final study report for the 9 &#8209;month toxicology study to be conducted by us in non &#8209;human primates. For the first KOR Product we develop, we are required to make milestone payments in an amount not to exceed, in the aggregate, $19.0 million upon the achievement of various development and regulatory milestones, including first commercial sale. Additionally, we are required to make sales milestone payments in an amount not to exceed $30.0 million. Upon commercialization of a KOR Product, we will pay Lilly a tiered royalty on net sales of KOR Product from mid &#8209;single digits to low &#8209;double digits. The royalty obligation will be on a product by product and country by country basis until the later of (i) the expiration of the last to expire valid patent claim of a patent licensed to us under the license agreement covering the KOR Product in such country, and (ii) eleven years from the first commercial sale of the KOR Product in such country. 

&#160; 

Our license agreement with Lilly will remain in effect on a product by product and country by country basis until our obligation to pay royalties under the license agreement expire with respect to such product in such country. Upon expiration of the license agreement with respect to a product in a country, our license grant for such product in such country will become a fully paid up, royalty free, irrevocable, perpetual non-exclusive license. 

&#160; 

We have the unilateral right to terminate the license agreement in its entirety without cause upon 90 days prior written notice to Lilly. Either party may terminate the license agreement in its entirety in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party, upon the other party&#8217;s filing or institution of bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership proceeding or upon an assignment of a substantial portion of its assets for the benefit of creditors. If Lilly terminates the agreement for cause, or if we exercise our right to terminate the agreement without cause, the rights granted to us under this license will revert to Lilly. 

&#160; 

Merck COMTi License 

&#160; 

In 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Merck pursuant to which Merck granted to us certain rights in small molecule compounds which are known to inhibit the activity of COMT as its primary mechanism of action and any pharmaceutical product containing such compounds, or a COMTi Product, in each case for the prevention, diagnosis and/or treatment of all disease in humans. Merck retained a co &#8209;exclusive right to conduct non &#8209;human and non &#8209;clinical research under such patents for certain COMT compounds. 

&#160; 

In connection with the license grant of certain COMT compounds and COMT Products, we granted Merck a right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive, worldwide license and/or other worldwide rights to research, develop, commercialize, sell and/or offer for sale any such COMT Product. Pursuant to such right of first negotiation, we must 

&#160;

provide advance notice to Merck if we intend to offer a license of any kind or to assign or transfer or otherwise convey any other rights related to the development or commercialization of a COMT Product. If Merck either chooses not to exercise its right of first negotiation or we fail to enter into an agreement with Merck as provided in the agreement, we will be free to enter into negotiations and contract with respect to such COMT Product with a third party and will have no further obligation to Merck regarding such COMT Product. 

&#160; 

In consideration of the license, we made a $200,000 upfront payment to Merck. For each COMT Product we develop, we are required to pay up to $6.15 million in milestone payments upon achievement of various development and regulatory milestones. Upon commercialization of a COMT Product, we are required to pay Merck a royalty of a low single digit on net sales of a COMT Product. The royalty obligation will be on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis until the later of (a) the expiration of the last to expire valid patent claim of a patent licensed to us under the license agreement covering the COMT Product in such country, and (b) ten years from the first commercial sale of the COMT Product in such country. 

&#160; 

Our license agreement with Merck will remain in effect on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis until our obligation to pay royalties under the license agreement expire with respect to such product in such country. Upon expiration of the license agreement with respect to a product in a country, our license grant for such product in such country will become a fully paid &#8209;up, royalty &#8209;free, irrevocable, perpetual non &#8209;exclusive license. 

&#160; 

We have the unilateral right to terminate the license agreement in its entirety without cause upon 90 days prior written notice to Merck. Either party may terminate the license agreement in its entirety in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party, upon the other party&#8217;s filing or institution of bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership proceeding or upon an assignment of a substantial portion of its assets for the benefit of creditors. Merck may terminate the license agreement with respect to a particular patent licensed to us if we challenge the validity or enforceability of such patent. If Merck terminates the agreement for cause, or if we exercise our right to terminate the agreement without cause, the rights granted to us under this license will revert to Merck. 

&#160; 

Commercialization 

&#160; 

We have not yet established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure because our candidates are still in preclinical or early clinical development. We intend to selectively retain commercialization or co &#8209;commercialization rights in the United States for CERC &#8209;301, CERC &#8209;501 and certain indications of our COMTi platform, which we may complement with co &#8209;promotion agreements with partners. For those product candidates for which we receive marketing approval, we plan to build a specialty sales force and marketing team as well as to collaborate with third parties to market the approved product candidates in the United States. We may also seek to commercialize any of our approved products outside of the United States, although we only plan to do so with one or more collaborators. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies, both in the United States and abroad. We compete, or will compete, with existing and new products being developed by our competitors. Some of these competitors are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that our research and development programs target. Even if we and our potential collaborators are successful in developing our product candidates, the resulting products would compete with a variety of established drugs in the areas of depression, bipolar depression, post &#8209;partum depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson&#8217;s disease and impulse control disorders, or ICDs. 

&#160; 

CERC &#8209;301 

&#160; 

Our lead product candidate, CERC &#8209;301, will compete with other drugs used as adjunctive therapies for the treatment of MDD, such as Abilify, marketed by Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc. and Bristol &#8209;Myers Squibb; 

&#160;

Seroquel XR, marketed by Astra Zeneca; and bupropion, a generic drug. Furthermore, to our knowledge, there are five competitive rapid onset antidepressant or anti &#8209;suicide programs in development: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Esketamine is in Phase 3 development by Johnson &#38; Johnson, or J&#38;J, for administration as a nasal spray; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

AZD8108 has completed Phase 1 development by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, for oral administration; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Rapastinel is approaching Phase 3 development by Allergan plc, or Allergan, for intravenous administration; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

NRX 1074 is approaching Phase 2 development by Allergan for oral administration; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

AV-101, an oral prodrug of 7-chlorokynurenic acid, is in Phase 2 development by VistaGen Therapeutics 

&#160; 

CERC &#8209;501 

&#160; 

There are no approved pharmacologic treatments for co &#8209;occurring disorders even though there are around five million Americans alone who suffer from co &#8209;occurring depression and substance use disorders. Our second Phase 2 product candidate, CERC &#8209;501, is being developed with the ultimate goal of treating such co &#8209;occurring disorders. To our knowledge, there are no other single moiety selective KOR antagonists in development to date. ALKS 5461, however, is believed to be acting as a functional KOR antagonist that is now in Phase 3 development for MDD as an adjunctive antidepressant in patients with MDD who have no more than two inadequate responses to antidepressant therapy. To our knowledge, the only other competitive program that is being studied in depression and substance use disorders is LY2940094 by Lilly that is in Phase 2 development for the treatment of both MDD and alcohol dependence. 

&#160; 

COMT Inhibitor Platform 

&#160; 

Our potential products for the treatment of schizophrenia would compete with Zyprexa, marketed by Lilly; Risperdal, marketed by J&#38;J; Abilify, Seroquel, and Clozaril. Zyprexa (olanzapine), Risperdal (risperidone), Seroquel (quetiapine) and Clozaril (clozapine) are all now generic in the United States. Currently, no treatments are approved for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, although Forum Pharmaceuticals is developing EVP &#8209;6124 (encenicline) which is in Phase 3 development by for the treatment of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. 

&#160; 

Our potential products for the treatment of the cognitive impairment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease may compete with existing COMT inhibitors Comtan (entacapone), marketed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., or Novartis, (licensed from Orion), Tasmar (tolcapone), marketed by Valeant, and Stalevo (fixed combinations of entacapone and levodopa/carbidopa), also marketed by Novartis (licensed from Orion). Comtan, Tasmar, and Stalevo are all generic in the United States. Currently, no treatments are approved for cognitive impairment in Parkinson&#8217;s disease. 

&#160; 

Our potential products for the treatment of ICDs would compete with the off &#8209;label use of SSRIs. In addition, the pure opioid antagonist, Revia (naltrexone) is approved for treating alcohol dependence and the blockage of the effects of exogenously administered opioids and is marketed by Teva Women&#8217;s. The FDA has not approved specific medications in the treatment of ICDs; however, some medications have proven effective, including SSRI antidepressants. 

&#160; 

CERC &#8209;406 

&#160; 

There are no approved pharmacologic treatments for cognitive impairment associated with MDD in the U.S. at this time. In March 2015, vortioxetine (Brintellix &#174; ), marketed in the United States by Lundbeck Pharmaceuticals, which was originally developed and commercialized for the treatment of MDD, received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency to expand the label to include information for cognitive function in patients with depression. A supplemental application for the addition of clinical data to the FDA approved product label for Brintellix was recently accepted by the FDA for review. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Overall Competitive Climate and Risks 

&#160; 

In addition, the companies described above and other competitors may have a variety of drugs in development or may be awaiting FDA approval that could reach the market and become established before we have a product to sell. Our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any drugs that we may develop. Many of our competitors are using technologies or methods different or similar to ours to identify and validate drug targets and to discover novel small compound drugs. Many of our competitors and their collaborators have significantly greater experience than we do in the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

identifying and validating targets; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

screening compounds against targets; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

preclinical and clinical trials of potential pharmaceutical products; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

obtaining FDA and other regulatory clearances. 

&#160; 

In addition, many of our competitors and their collaborators have substantially greater advantages in the following areas: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

capital resources; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

research and development resources; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

manufacturing capabilities; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

sales and marketing. 

&#160; 

Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Many of our competitors have products that have been approved or are in advanced development. We face competition from other companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, may succeed in developing technologies or drugs that are more effective, safer, and more affordable or more easily administered than ours and may achieve patent protection or commercialize drugs sooner than us. Developments by others may render our product candidates or our technologies obsolete. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

For additional information on risks regarding our competition, refer to the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

&#160; 

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export, pricing, and government contracting related to pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 

&#160; 

&#160;

United States Government Regulation 

&#160; 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, or other actions, such as the FDA&#8217;s delay in review of or refusal to approve a pending NDA, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or study termination, issuance of Warning Letters or Untitled Letters, mandated modifications to promotional materials or issuance of corrective information, requests for product recalls, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, deferred prosecution agreements, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow product import or export, total or partial suspension of or restriction of or imposition of other requirements relating to production or distribution, injunctions, fines, debarment from government contracts and refusal of future orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, FDA debarment, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment. 

&#160; 

The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

approval by local or central independent institutional review boards, or IRB, before each clinical trial may be initiated; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

performance of human clinical trials, including adequate and well &#8209;controlled clinical trials, in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, and regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or GMP, regulations and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity, as well as satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to determine GCP compliance; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

&#160; 

Additionally, if a drug is considered a controlled substance, prior to the commencement of marketing, the DEA must also determine the controlled substance schedule, taking into account the recommendation of the FDA. 

&#160; 

Preclinical Studies and IND Submission 

&#160; 

Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. Once the IND is submitted, the sponsor must wait 30 calendar days before initiating any clinical trials. During this time, among other things, the FDA has an opportunity to review the IND for safety to assure that research subjects 

&#160;

will not be subjected to unreasonable risk. The FDA may raise concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and place the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 

&#160; 

Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, and review and approval by an IRB. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, and a statistical analysis plan. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, a central IRB or local IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial, including any changes, while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. 

&#160; 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or subjects with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered through well &#8209;controlled studies to a limited subject population with the target disease or condition to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded subject population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in two adequate and well &#8209;controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk &#8209;benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 

&#160; 

The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to GMP requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as United States export requirements under the FDCA. 

&#160; 

Progress reports and other summary information detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if certain serious adverse events occur or other significant safety information is found. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or the trial is not being conducted in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements or the protocol. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of trial subjects, potential trial subjects, and the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 

&#160; 

Marketing Approval 

&#160; 

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed 

&#160;

labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. These user fees must be filed at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. A waiver from the application user fee may be sought by an applicant. One basis for a waiver of the application user fee is if the applicant employs fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, the applicant does not have a drug product that has been approved under a human drug application and introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, and the applicant, including its affiliates, is submitting its first human drug application. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals regarding the timing of its review of an application. The FDA aims to review 90% of all standard review applications within ten months of acceptance for filing and six months of acceptance for filing for priority review applications. 

&#160; 

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen or route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 

&#160; 

The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, either during the application process or after the approval of the drug to ensure the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. 

&#160; 

The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in &#8209;depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#8217;s continued safety, quality and purity. 

&#160; 

Under the FDCA, before approving a drug for which no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of active ingredients) has previously been approved by the FDA, the FDA must either refer that drug to an external advisory committee or provide in an action letter, a summary of the reasons why the FDA did not refer the drug to an advisory committee. The external advisory committee review may also be required for other drugs because of certain other issues, including clinical trial design, safety and effectiveness, and public health questions. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 

&#160; 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications by the manufacturer and all of its subcontractors and contract manufacturers. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP regulations. 

&#160; 

The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all. 

&#160; 

&#160;

After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing, or other information, in order for FDA to reconsider the application. The FDA has a review goal of completing its review of 90% of resubmissions within two or six months after receipt, depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 

&#160; 

Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a black boxed warning, require that post &#8209;approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug&#8217;s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post &#8209;marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, certain circumstances may require FDA notification, review, or approval, as well as further testing. These may include some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, or new safety information 

&#160; 

Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs 

&#160; 

The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review and breakthrough designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions, and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs or present a significant improvement over existing therapy. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 

&#160; 

To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if the product will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy, safety, or public health factors. If fast track designation is obtained, drug sponsors may be eligible for more frequent development meetings and correspondence with the FDA. In addition, the FDA may initiate review of sections of an NDA before the application is complete. This &#8220;rolling review&#8221; is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the remaining information. In some cases, a fast track product may be eligible for accelerated approval or priority review. 

&#160; 

The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA is to review an application in six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. These six and ten month review periods are measured from the &#8220;filing&#8221; date rather than the receipt date for NDAs, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Products that are eligible for fast track designation may also be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 

&#160; 

In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life &#8209;threatening illnesses or conditions and that fill an unmet medical need may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well &#8209;controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of 

&#160;

alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post &#8209;marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoints, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. 

&#160; 

Moreover, under the provisions of the new Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a &#8220;breakthrough therapy.&#8221; A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life &#8209;threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are eligible for the fast track designation features as described above, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase 1 trials, and a commitment from the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in a proactive collaborative, cross &#8209;disciplinary review. 

&#160; 

Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 

&#160; 

Post &#8209;Approval Requirements 

&#160; 

Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, manufacturing, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product and drug shortages. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 

&#160; 

The FDA may impose a number of post &#8209;approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post &#8209;marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 

&#160; 

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and list drugs manufactured at their facilities with the FDA. These facilities are further subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with GMP and other regulatory requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and may require prior approval by the FDA or notification to the FDA before or after being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from GMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third &#8209;party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. 

&#160; 

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product becomes available in the market. 

&#160; 

Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post &#8209;market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

fines, Warning Letters or Untitled Letters, holds or termination of post &#8209;approval clinical trials or FDA debarment; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

delay or refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

regulatory authority, including the FDA, issued safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings about such products; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

mandated modifications to promotional material or issuance of corrective information; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 

&#160; 

&#183; 

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, including imprisonment, disgorgement and restitution, as well as consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, deferred prosecution agreements and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. 

&#160; 

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications, pharmaceutical companies are prohibited from marketing or promoting their drug products for uses outside of the approved indications in the approved prescribing information. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off &#8209;label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly marketed or promoted off &#8209;label uses may be subject to significant liability, including criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs debarment from government contracts and refusal of future orders under existing contracts, and mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements or deferred prosecution agreements. 

&#160; 

In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products, including samples, is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which, among other things, regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 

&#160; 

Moreover, the recently enacted Drug Quality and Security Act, imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding drug products to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug products with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding drug products. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers&#8217; products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, manufactures will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and FDA and trading partner notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products such that they would result in serious adverse health consequences or death, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. 

&#160; 

DEA Regulation 

&#160; 

While we currently do not know whether any of our product candidates will be considered to be controlled substances, we will be required to evaluate the abuse potential of our product candidates. If any of our product candidates are considered controlled substances, we will need to comply with additional regulatory requirements. 

&#160; 

Certain drug products may be regulated as &#8220;controlled substances&#8221; as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration&#8217;s, or DEA&#8217;s, implementing regulations. The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have 

&#160;

no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. FDA provides a recommendation to DEA as to whether a drug should be classified as a controlled substance and the appropriate level of control. If DEA scheduling is required, a drug product may not be marketed until the scheduling process is completed, which could delay the launch of the product. 

&#160; 

Depending on the Schedule, drug products may be subject to registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation, inventory, quota and other requirements administered by the DEA, which are directly applicable to product applicants, contract manufacturers and to distributors, prescribers and dispensers of controlled substances. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. 

&#160; 

Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. Similarly, separate registrations are also required for separate facilities. 

&#160; 

The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration and on a periodic basis. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports may be required to made to the DEA for the distribution of certain controlled substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or significant losses of any controlled substance. To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings or consent decrees. Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. 

&#160; 

Federal and State Healthcare related, Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations 

&#160; 

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse, and other laws regulations, and requirements restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti &#8209;kickback and false claims laws and regulations, state and federal transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to health care professionals, as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations and other requirements applicable to the healthcare industry, including pharmaceutical manufacturers. There are also laws, regulations, and requirements applicable to the award and performance of federal contracts and grants. 

&#160; 

The federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are narrowly drawn. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#8217;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The reach of the Anti Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti Kickback Statute and certain provisions of the criminal health care fraud statute (discussed below) such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim for payment for items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Penalties for violation of the Anti Kickback Statute include criminal fines, imprisonment, civil penalties and damages, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and corporate integrity agreements or deferred prosecution agreements. Conviction or civil judgments are also grounds for debarment from government contracts. 

&#160; 

The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, including payments under a federal grant. A claim includes &#8220;any request or demand&#8221; for money or property presented to the United States government. The False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil False Claims Act. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been sued under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Companies have also been sued for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies&#8217; marketing of products for unapproved, or off &#8209;label, uses. In addition, federal health care programs require drug manufacturers to report drug pricing information, which is used to quantify discounts and establish reimbursement rates. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been sued for reporting allegedly false pricing information, which caused the manufacturer to understate rebates owed or, when used to determine reimbursement rates, caused overpayment to providers. Violations of the civil False Claims Act may result in civil penalties and damages as well as exclusion from federal healthcare programs and corporate integrity agreements or deferred prosecution agreements. The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the criminal False Claims Act. The criminal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike the civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim. Violations of the criminal False Claims Act can result in criminal fines and/or imprisonment, as well as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Conviction or civil judgments and other conduct are also grounds for debarment from government contracts and grants. 

&#160; 

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third &#8209;party payers, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. As discussed above, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain of HIPAA&#8217;s healthcare fraud provisions such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations of HIPAA&#8217;s fraud and abuse provisions may result in fines or imprisonment, as well as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, depending on the conduct in question. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 

&#160; 

The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 

&#160; 

The Veterans Health Care Act requires manufacturers of covered drugs to offer them for sale on the Federal Supply Schedule, which requires compliance with applicable federal procurement laws and regulations and subjects us to contractual remedies as well as administrative, civil and criminal sanctions. 

&#160; 

&#160;

In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other health care providers. The Affordable Care Act created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members. Certain states also require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments or the provision of other items of value that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; impose restrictions on marketing practices; and/or require drug manufacturers to track and report information related to payments, gifts and other items of value to physicians and other healthcare providers. 

&#160; 

We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Penalties for violating HIPAA include civil penalties, criminal penalties and imprisonment. Among other things, HITECH, through its implementing regulations, makes HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to &#8220;business associates,&#8221; defined as a person or organization, other than a member of a covered entity&#8217;s workforce, that creates, receives, maintains or transmits protected health information on behalf of a covered entity for a function or activity regulated by HIPAA. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys&#8217; fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, other federal and state laws govern the privacy and security of health and other information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

&#160; 

To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post &#8209;marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti &#8209;fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 

&#160; 

Coverage and Reimbursement 

&#160; 

The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third &#8209;party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our therapeutic product candidates. In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third &#8209;party payers are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage, attempting to limit reimbursement levels or regulate the price of drugs and other medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. For example, in the United States, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. Federal programs also impose price controls through mandatory ceiling prices on purchases by federal agencies and federally funded hospitals and clinics and mandatory rebates on retail pharmacy prescriptions paid by Medicaid and Tricare. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government programs may result in lower reimbursement for our product candidates or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage. Moreover, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payers and other governmental payers develop their coverage and reimbursement policies. 

&#160; 

In addition, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, competition within therapeutic classes, availability of generic equivalents, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and 

&#160;

healthcare reform, coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general. The cost containment measures that healthcare payers and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third &#8209;party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part. 

&#160; 

Impact of Healthcare Reform on Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing 

&#160; 

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription, pharmacy drugs pursuant to federal regulations. Part D plans include both standalone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. In general, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors have flexibility regarding coverage of Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class, with certain exceptions. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be discounted, thereby lowering the net price realized on our sales to pharmacies. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non &#8209;governmental payers. 

&#160; 

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor&#8217;s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third &#8209;party payers do not consider our product candidates to be cost &#8209;effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 

&#160; 

The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, most recently, the Affordable Care Act, which became law in March 2010 and substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the Affordable Care Act establishes an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; expansion of Medicaid benefits and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; and expansion of the 340B drug discount program that mandates discounts to certain hospitals, community centers and other qualifying providers. In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the United States healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge or the amounts of reimbursement available for our product candidates once they are approved. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

&#160; 

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts. 

&#160; 

Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products 

&#160; 

Hatch &#8209;Waxman Patent Exclusivity 

&#160; 

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant&#8217;s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA&#8217;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or 505(b)(2) NDA. Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro or in vivo testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as &#8220;generic equivalents&#8221; to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. 505(b)(2) NDAs generally are submitted for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form or indication. 

&#160; 

The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to provide a certification to the FDA in the product application concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the required patent information has not been filed; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the listed patent has expired; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the new product. 

&#160; 

Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent or if the listed patent is a patented method of use for which approval is not being sought. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product&#8217;s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 

&#160; 

If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response 

&#160;

to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant or other period determined by a court. 

&#160; 

Hatch &#8209;Waxman Non &#8209;Patent Exclusivity 

&#160; 

Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five &#8209;year period of non &#8209;patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non &#8209;infringement. 

&#160; 

The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three &#8209;year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three &#8209;year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five &#8209;year and three &#8209;year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well &#8209;controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 

&#160; 

Pediatric Exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non &#8209;patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non &#8209;patent exclusivity period described above. This six &#8209;month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA&#8217;s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. 

&#160; 

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity. The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or affecting more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug available in the United States will be recovered from United States sales. Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan designation if there is a drug already approved by the FDA that is intended for the same indication and that is considered by the FDA to be the same drug as the already approved drug. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user &#8209;fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is generally entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. While we have not sought to obtain orphan drug designation for any of our products, we may in the future seek such designation if we determine that the relevant criteria are met.

&#160;

Foreign Regulation 

&#160; 

In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For example, in the European Union, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application, or CTA, in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 

&#160; 

European Union Drug Approval Process 

&#160; 

To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the European Union, we may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAAs, either under the so &#8209;called centralized or national authorization procedures. 

&#160; 

Centralized procedure 

&#160; 

The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency or EMA that is valid in all European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop &#8209;clocks. 

&#160; 

National authorization procedures 

&#160; 

There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. 

&#160; 

In the European Union, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the 

&#160;

reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the data on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten &#8209;year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 13 full &#8209;time employees, seven of whom were primarily engaged in research and development activities and three of whom had an M.D. and/or Ph.D. degree. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
