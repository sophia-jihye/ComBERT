BUSINESS 

Description of Business 

Arrowhead develops medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, Arrowhead therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference, or RNAi, is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. Deemed to be one of the most important recent discoveries in life science with the potential to transform medicine, the discoverers of RNAi were awarded a Nobel Prize in 2006 for their work. Arrowhead&#8217;s RNAi-based therapeutics leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing.

Pre-clinical Stage Drug Candidates

&#160;

&#8226; 

Subcutaneous: 

&#160;

&#149; 

ARO-HBV is being developed to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection by reducing the expression and release of new viral particles and key viral proteins with the goal of achieving a functional cure. 

&#160;

&#149; 

ARO-AAT is being developed to treat liver disease associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), a rare genetic disease that can severely damage the liver and lungs of affected individuals. The goal of treatment with ARO- AAT is to reduce the production of the mutant Z-AAT protein to prevent and potentially reverse accumulation-related liver injury and fibrosis. 

&#160;

&#149; 

ARO-LPA is designed to reduce production of apolipoprotein A, a key component of lipoprotein(a), which has been genetically linked with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, independent of cholesterol and LDL levels. Amgen, Inc. (&#8220;Amgen&#8221;) acquired a worldwide, exclusive license in September 2016 to develop and commercialize ARO-LPA. 

&#160;

&#149; 

ARO-AMG1 is being developed against an undisclosed genetically validated cardiovascular target under a license and collaboration agreement with Amgen. 

&#160;

&#149; 

ARO-F12 is in preclinical development as a potential treatment for factor 12 (F12) mediated diseases such as hereditary angioedema (HAE) and thromboembolic disorders. Factor 12 initiates the intrinsic coagulation pathway, and reducing its production using Arrowhead&#8217;s RNAi technology may present opportunities in both disease areas. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Extra-Hepatic: 

&#160;

&#149; 

ARO-HIF2 is being developed as a new drug candidate for the treatment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). ARO-HIF2 is designed to inhibit the production of HIF-2&#945;, which has been linked to tumor progression and metastasis in ccRCC. Arrowhead believes it is an attractive target for intervention because over 90% of ccRCC tumors express a mutant form of the Von Hippel-Landau protein that is unable to degrade HIF-2&#945;, leading to its accumulation during tumor hypoxia and promoting tumor growth. ARO-HIF2 is Arrowhead&#8217;s first drug candidate using a new delivery vehicle designed to target tissues outside of the liver. 

&#160;

Recent Events 

Arrowhead made announcements throughout fiscal 2016 discussing progress towards the company&#8217;s goals as well as key developments. The following are highlights of those developments:

&#160;

&#8226; 

Discontinued development of ARC-520, ARC-521 and ARC-AAT in November 2016 

&#160;

&#149; 

The Company announced that it would be discontinuing these clinical programs, which utilized the intravenously administered DPC iv , or EX1, delivery vehicle, and redeploying its resources and focus toward utilizing the Company&#8217;s new proprietary subcutaneous and extra-hepatic delivery systems. 

&#160;

&#149; 

The decision to discontinue development of EX1-containing programs was based primarily on two factors. 

&#160;

&#9642; 

During ongoing discussions with regulatory agencies and outside experts, it became apparent that there would be substantial delays in all clinical programs that utilize EX1, while the Company further explored the cause of deaths in a non-clinical toxicology study in non-human primates exploring doses of EX1 higher than those planned to be used in humans. 

&#160;

&#9642; 

The Company has made substantial advances in RNA chemistry and targeting resulting in large potency gains for subcutaneous administered and extra-hepatic RNAi-based development programs. 

&#160;

&#149; 

Because of the discontinuation of its existing clinical programs, the Company also reduced its workforce by approximately 30%, while maintaining resources necessary to support current and potential partner-based programs and the Company&#8217;s pipeline. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Entered into two collaboration and license agreements with Amgen, Inc. (&#8220;Amgen&#8221;) 

&#160;

&#149; 

Total deal value of up to $673.5 million 

&#160;

&#149; 

Arrowhead received $56.5 million upfront: 

&#160;

&#9642; 

$35 million in upfront cash payments, $21.5 million equity investment 

&#160;

&#149; 

Up to low double-digit royalties for ARO-LPA and single-digit royalties for the undisclosed target, ARO- AMG1 

&#160;

&#149; 

Amgen receives: 

&#160;

&#9642; 

Exclusive license to ARO-LPA program 

&#160;

&#9642; 

Option for an additional candidate against an undisclosed target, ARO-AMG1 

&#160;

&#149; 

Amgen will be wholly responsible for funding and conducting all clinical development and commercialization 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Continued progress on preclinical candidates including ARO-HBV, ARO-AAT, ARO-F12, ARO-LPA and ARO-HIF2 

&#160;

&#149; 

Regarding ARO-F12 and ARO-LPA: 

&#160;

&#9642; 

Presented preclinical data at the American Heart Association&#8217;s Scientific Sessions 2016 for two development programs using Arrowhead&#8217;s proprietary subcutaneous delivery platform: 

&#160;

&#9642; 

RNAi triggers against Factor 12 (F12) showed dose dependent reductions in serum F12 

&#160;

&#9642; 

A statistically significant reduction (p=0.002) in thrombus weight was observed at greater than 95% F12 knockdown in a rat arterio-venous shunt model 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9642; 

There was no increased bleeding risk in AR O - F12 -treated mice, even with greater than 99% knockdown of F12 levels 

&#160;

&#9642; 

RNAi triggers against Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] led to greater than 98% maximum knockdown after a single 3 mg/kg SQ dose in Transgenic mice 

&#160;

&#9642; 

In an atherosclerosis model, data suggest that RNAi triggers can be effectively delivered to a fatty liver using the subcutaneous delivery platform 

&#160;

&#149; 

Regarding ARO-HIF2 

&#160;

&#9642; 

Presented preclinical data showing that ARO-HIF2 inhibited renal cell carcinoma growth and promoted tumor cell death in its preclinical studies. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Strengthened the Company&#8217;s balance sheet with August 2016 private offering and Amgen agreement upfronts 

&#160;

&#149; 

In August 2016, the Company sold 7.6 million shares of Common Stock to certain institutional investors and received net proceeds of approximately $43.2 million. 

&#160;

&#149; 

As part of the collaboration and license agreements as well as a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Amgen, $14 million of the total $56.5 million upfront cash payments and equity investments were received in September 2016, and the remaining $42.5 million was received in November 2016. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Continued progress of on former drug candidates prior to the discontinuations 

&#160;

&#149; 

Presented preclinical and clinical data on former drug candidate ARC-AAT at the Liver Meeting 

&#160;

&#149; 

In a first-in-human clinical study, ARC-AAT was well tolerated and induced deep and durable reduction of the target AAT protein 

&#160;

&#149; 

The preclinical data suggest a possible improvement of liver health and arrest of further damage from treatment with ARC-AAT 

&#160;

&#149; 

Advanced former drug candidate ARC-521 into a Phase 1/2 study 

&#160;

&#149; 

Conducted multiple dose and combination studies of former drug candidate ARC-520 

Acquisition of Roche and Novartis RNAi assets

The last five years have brought substantial change to Arrowhead&#8217;s research and development (R&#38;D) capabilities and strategy. We are now an integrated RNAi therapeutics company, developing novel drugs that silence disease-causing genes based on our broad RNAi technology platform. 

The most significant step in this transition was our 2011 acquisition of the RNAi therapeutics business of Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (collectively, &#8220;Roche&#8221;). Roche built this business unit in a manner that only a large pharmaceutical company is capable of: backed by expansive capital resources, Roche systematically acquired technologies, licensed expansive intellectual property rights, attracted leading scientists, and developed new technologies internally. At a time when the markets were questioning whether RNAi could become a viable therapeutic modality, we saw great promise in the technology broadly and the quality of what Roche built specifically. The acquisition provided us with two primary sources of value:

&#160;

&#8226; 

Broad freedom to operate with respect to key patents directed to the primary RNAi-trigger formats: canonical, UNA, meroduplex, and dicer substrate structures; and 

&#160;

&#8226; 

A large team of scientists experienced in RNAi and oligonucleotide delivery. 

&#160;

In addition, in March 2015 we acquired the entire RNAi research and development portfolio and associated assets of Novartis. Novartis had been working in the R NAi field for over a decade and made some very important advancements in their developments of proprietary oligonucleotide formatting and modifications . Key aspects of the acquisition include the following: 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Multiple patent families covering RNAi-trigger design rules and modifications that fall outside of key patents controlled by competitors, which we believe provides freedom to operate for any target and indication; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Novel intracellular targeting ligands that enhance the activity of RNAi-triggers by targeting the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) more effectively and improving stability once RISC is loaded; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

An assignment of Novartis' license from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;Alnylam&#8221;) granting Arrowhead access to certain Alnylam intellectual property, excluding delivery, for 30 gene targets; and 

&#160;

&#8226; 

A pipeline of three candidates initiated by Novartis for which Novartis has developed varying amounts of preclinical data. 

We see the Roche and Novartis acquisitions as a powerful combination of intellectual property, R&#38;D infrastructure, and RNAi delivery experts. We believe we are the only company with access to all primary RNAi-trigger structures now including additional novel structures discovered by Novartis. This enables us to optimize our drug candidates on a target-by-target basis and use the structure and modifications that yield the most potent RNAi trigger. Our R&#38;D team and facility enable rapid innovation and drive to the clinic.

RNA Interference &#38; the Benefits of RNAi Therapeutics

RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. Deemed to be one of the most important recent discoveries in life science with the potential to transform medicine, the discoverers of RNAi were awarded a Nobel Prize in 2006 for their work. RNAi-based therapeutics may leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing to target and shut down specific disease-causing genes. 

&#160;

Figure 1: Mechanism of RNA interference

Small molecule and antibody drugs have proven effective at inhibiting certain cell surface, intracellular, and extracellular targets. However, other drug targets such as intranuclear genes and some proteins have proven difficult to inhibit with traditional drug-based and biologic therapeutics. Developing effective drugs for these targets would have the potential to address large underserved 

&#160;

marke ts for the treatment of many diseases. Using the ability to specifically silence any gene, RNAi therapeutics may be able to address previously &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets, unlocking the market potential of such targets. 

Advantages of RNAi as a Therapeutic Modality

&#160;

&#8226; 

Silences the expression of disease causing genes; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Potential to address any target in the transcriptome including previously "undruggable" targets; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Rapid lead identification; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

High specificity; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Opportunity to use multiple RNA sequences in one drug product for synergistic silencing of related targets; and 

RNAi therapeutics are uniquely suited for personalized medicine through target and cell specific delivery and gene knockdown.

Pipeline Overview

Arrowhead is focused on developing innovative drugs for diseases with a genetic basis, characterized by the overproduction of one or more proteins. The depth and versatility of our RNAi technologies enable us to address conditions in virtually any therapeutic area and pursue disease targets that are not otherwise druggable by small molecules and biologics. Our preclinical pipeline of RNAi therapeutics includes both subcutaneously administered liver-targeted candidates and extra-hepatic candidates.

&#160;

Internal Programs

Hepatitis B Virus Infection

We see the need for a next generation HBV treatment with a finite treatment period and an attractive dosing regimen, and that can be used at earlier stages of disease. We believe a novel therapeutic approach that can effectively treat or provide a functional cure (seroclearance of HBsAg and with or without development of excess patient antibodies against HBsAg) has the potential to take significant market share and may expand the available market to include patients that are currently untreated. 

Chronic Hepatitis B Virus

According to the World Health Organization, 240 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus, of which 500,000 to 1,000,000 people die each year from HBV-related liver disease. Chronic HBV infection is defined by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) for more than six months. In the immune tolerant phase of chronic infection, which can last for many years, the infected person typically produces very high levels of viral DNA and viral antigens. However, the infection is not cytotoxic and the carrier may have no symptoms of illness. Over time, the ongoing production of viral antigens causes inflammation 

&#160;

and necrosis, leading to elevation of liver enzymes such as alanine and aspartate transaminases, hepa titis, fibrosis, and liver cancer ( hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC). If untreated, as many as 25% to 40% of chronic HBV carriers ultimately develop cirrhosis or HCC. Antiviral therapy is generally prescribed when liver enzymes become elevated. 

Current Treatments

The current standard of care for treatment of chronic HBV infection is a daily oral dose of nucleotide/nucleoside analogs (NUCs) or a regimen of interferon injections for approximately one year. NUCs are generally well tolerated, but patients may need lifetime treatment because viral replication often rebounds upon cessation of treatment. Interferon therapeutics can result in a functional cure in 10-20% of some patient types, but treatment is often associated with significant side effects, including severe flu-like symptoms, marrow suppression, and autoimmune disorders. 

ARO-HBV

ARO-HBV is an RNAi therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection with the goal of achieving a functional cure. This is a next-generation subcutaneously administered compound that follows previous generation HBV compounds ARC-520 and ARC-521, which were in Phase 2b and Phase 1/2 studies respectively when development was discontinued in November 2016.

Goal of ARO-HBV Treatment

ARO-HBV is designed to silence the production of all HBV gene products with the goal of achieving a functional cure. The siRNAs target multiple components of HBV production including the pregenomic RNA that would be reverse transcribed to generate the viral DNA. The siRNAs intervene at the mRNA level, upstream of where NUCs act, and target the mRNAs that produce HBsAg proteins, the viral polymerase, the core protein that forms the capsid, the pre-genomic RNA, the HBeAg, and the hepatitis B X antigen (HBxAg). NUCs are effective at reducing production of viral particles, but are ineffective at controlling production of HBsAg and other HBV gene products. Arrowhead believes that a reduction in the production of HBsAg and other proteins that NUCs are ineffective at controlling is necessary to effective HBV therapy, because those proteins are thought to be major contributors to repression of the immune system and the persistence of liver disease secondary to HBV infection.

Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD)

AATD is a genetic disorder associated with liver disease in children and adults, and pulmonary disease in adults. AAT is a circulating glycoprotein protease inhibitor that is primarily synthesized and secreted by liver hepatocytes. Its physiologic function is the inhibition of neutrophil proteases to protect healthy tissues during inflammation and prevent tissue damage. The most common disease variant, the Z mutant, has a single amino acid substitution that results in improper folding of the protein. The mutant protein cannot be effectively secreted and accumulates in globules in the hepatocytes. This triggers continuous hepatocyte injury, leading to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Current Treatments

Individuals with the homozygous PiZZ genotype have severe deficiency of functional AAT leading to pulmonary disease and hepatocyte injury and liver disease. Lung disease is frequently treated with AAT augmentation therapy. However, augmentation therapy does nothing to treat liver disease, and there is no specific therapy for hepatic manifestations. There is a significant unmet need as liver transplant, with its attendant morbidity and mortality, is currently the only available cure.

&#160;

ARO -AAT 

Arrowhead is developing a therapeutic candidate (ARO-AAT) for the treatment of liver disease associated with AATD. ARO-AAT is designed to knock down the Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) gene transcript and reduce the hepatic production of the mutant AAT protein. This is a next-generation subcutaneously administered compound that follows previous generation AAT compound ARC-AAT, which was in a Phase 2 study when development was discontinued in November 2016.

Goal of ARO-AAT Treatment

The goal of treatment with ARO-AAT is prevention and potential reversal of Z-AAT accumulation-related liver injury and fibrosis. Reduction of inflammatory Z-AAT protein, which has been clearly defined as the cause of progressive liver disease in AATD patients, is important as it is expected to halt the progression of liver disease and allow fibrotic tissue repair.

The Alpha-1 Project

Arrowhead has an agreement with The Alpha-1 Project (TAP), the venture philanthropy subsidiary of the Alpha-1 Foundation. TAP&#8217;s mission is to support organizations in pursuit of cures and therapies for lung and liver disease caused by AATD. Under the terms of the agreement, TAP has partially funded development of ARO-AAT. In addition to the funding, TAP will make its scientific advisors available to Arrowhead, assist with patient recruitment for clinical trials with its Alpha-1 Foundation Patient Research Registry, and engage in other collaborative efforts that support development of ARO-AAT.

ARO-F12

ARO-F12 is an RNAi-based therapeutic designed to reduce the production of factor 12 with the goal of providing a prophylactic treatment for hereditary angioedema (HAE) and thromboembolic diseases. Arrowhead is conducting relevant disease models and is considering other potential studies to support advancement of ARO-F12 into clinical trials.

ARO-HIF2

ARO-HIF2 is an RNAi-based therapeutic designed to reduce the production of hypoxia-inducible factor 2&#945; (HIF-2&#945;) to treat clear cell renal cell carcinoma. It is the first drug candidate using a new delivery vehicle designed to target tissues outside of the liver. 

Partner-based Programs

ARO-LPA and ARO-AMG1

ARO-LPA is designed to reduce production of apolipoprotein A, a key component of lipoprotein(a), which has been genetically linked with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, independent of cholesterol and LDL levels. Amgen acquired a worldwide, exclusive license in September 2016 to develop and commercialize ARO-LPA.

ARO-AMG1 is being developed against an undisclosed genetically-validated cardiovascular target under a license and collaboration agreement with Amgen.

Under the terms of the agreements taken together for ARO-LPA &#160; and ARO-AMG1, the Company will receive $35 million in upfront payments, $21.5 million in the form of an equity investment by Amgen in the Company&#8217;s Common Stock, and the Company is eligible to receive up to $617 million in option payments and development, regulatory and sales milestone payments. The Company is further eligible to receive single-digit royalties for sales of products under the ARO-AMG1 agreement and up to low double-digit royalties for sales of products under the ARO-LPA agreement. 

Intellectual Property and Key Agreements

Research and Development Expenses 

Research and development (R&#38;D) expenses consist of costs incurred in discovering, developing and testing our clinical and preclinical candidates and platform technologies. R&#38;D expenses also include costs related to clinical trials, including costs of contract research organizations to recruit patients and manage clinical trials. Other costs associated with clinical trials include manufacturing of clinical supplies, as well as good laboratory practice (&#8220;GLP&#8221;) toxicology studies necessary to support clinical trials, both of which are outsourced to cGMP-compliant manufacturers and GLP-compliant laboratories. Total research and development expense for fiscal 2016 was $41.5 million, a decrease from $47.3 million in 2015 and an increase from $23.1 million in 2014.

At September 30, 2016, we employed approximately 94 employees in an R&#38;D function, primarily working from our facility in Madison, Wisconsin. Due to the discontinuation of our clinical candidates in November 2016, we reduced our R&#38;D workforce and currently employ approximately 77 employees in an R&#38;D function. These employees are engaged in various areas of research on Arrowhead candidate and platform development including synthesis and analytics, PK/biodistribution, formulation, CMC and analytics, tumor and extra-hepatic targeting, bioassays, live animal research, toxicology/histopathology, clinical and regulatory operations, and other areas. Salaries and payroll-related expenses for our R&#38;D activities were $13.9 million in fiscal 2016, $11.6 million in fiscal 2015, and $7.8 million in fiscal 2014. Laboratory supplies including animal-related costs for in-vivo studies were $4.3 million, $3.1 million, and $2.3 million in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Costs related to manufacture of clinical supplies, GLP toxicology studies and other outsourced lab studies, as well as clinical trial costs were $32.6 million, $41.8 million, and $18.8 million in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 

Facility-related costs, primarily rental costs for our leased laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin were $1.3 million, $1.0 million, and $0.9 million in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Other research and development expenses were $3.2 million, $1.4 

&#160;

million, and $1. 2 million in fiscal 201 6 , 201 5 and 201 4 , respectively. These expenses are primaril y related to milestone payments, which can vary from period to period depending on the nature of our various license agreements, and the timing of reaching various development milestones requiring payment. 

Government Regulation 

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, and local levels, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, product approval, manufacture, quality control, manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, promotion, advertising, sales, distribution, marketing, and import and export of drugs and biologic products. All of our foreseeable product candidates are expected to be regulated as drugs. The processes for obtaining regulatory approval in the U.S. and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities both pre- and post-commercialization, are a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our R&#38;D activities and require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States 

In the U.S., the FDA and other government entities regulate drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the &#8220;FDCA&#8221;), the Public Health Service Act, and the regulations promulgated under those statutes, as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S. at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of approvals, delay or suspension of clinical trials, issuance of warning letters and other types of regulatory letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil monetary penalties, refusals of or debarment from government contracts, exclusion from the federal healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement of profits, civil or criminal investigations by the FDA, U.S. Department of Justice, State Attorneys General, and/or other agencies, False Claims Act suits and/or other litigation, and/or criminal prosecutions. 

An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug in the U.S. must typically undertake the following: 

(1) completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s GLP regulations; 

(2) submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (&#8220;IND&#8221;) for human clinical testing, which must become effective without FDA objection before human clinical trials may begin; 

(3) approval by an independent institutional review board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;), representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 

(4) performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s current good clinical practice (&#8220;cGCP&#8221;) regulations, to establish the safety and effectiveness of the proposed drug product for each indication for which approval is sought; 

(5) preparation and submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;);

(6) satisfactory review of the NDA by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable,

(7) satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product, and the active pharmaceutical ingredient or ingredients thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) regulations and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to ensure the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality, and purity; 

(8) payment of user fees, as applicable, and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and

(9) compliance with any post-approval requirements, such as any Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (&#8220;REMS&#8221;) or post-approval studies required by the FDA. 

&#160;

Preclinical Studies and an IND 

Preclinical studies can include in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and, in some cases, to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. Other studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity, stability and physical form of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the physical properties, stability and reproducibility of the formulated drug or drug product. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing, such as longer-term toxicity testing, animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 

Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may place a clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.

Human Clinical Studies in Support of an NDA 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 

Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 

Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 

Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites in late-stage clinical trials to assure compliance with cGCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 

&#160;

Submission of an NDA to the FDA 

Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, currently exceeding $2.4 million, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $114,450 per product and $585,200 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually. 

Under certain circumstances, the FDA will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business, defined as a company with less than 500 employees, or its affiliate, submits for review. An affiliate is defined as a business entity that has a relationship with a second business entity if one business entity controls, or has the power to control, the other business entity, or a third party controls, or has the power to control, both entities. In addition, an application to market a prescription drug product that has received orphan designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was designated.

The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA&#8217;s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for &#8220;priority review&#8221; products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. 

The FDA also may require submission of an REMS plan to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. 

The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 

The FDA&#8217;s Decision on an NDA 

On the basis of the FDA&#8217;s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 

&#160;

If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindicati ons, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug&#8217;s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor t he product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claim s, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 

The product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer&#8217;s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety and effectiveness of drug products. 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA, and both the drug and the disease or condition must meet certain criteria specified in the Orphan Drug Act and FDA&#8217;s implementing regulations at 21 C.F.R. Part 316. The granting of an orphan drug designation does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and effectiveness of a drug must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. 

After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. 

Post-Approval Requirements 

Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events or problems with manufacturing processes of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 

&#160;

&#8226; 

restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; 

product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 

&#160;

&#8226; 

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 

In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 

Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 

In 1984, with passage of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly referred to as the &#8220;Hatch-Waxman Amendments&#8221;) amending the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. To reference that information, however, the ANDA applicant must demonstrate, and the FDA must conclude, that the generic drug does, in fact, perform in the same way as the RLD it purports to copy. Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. 

At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is &#8220;bioequivalent&#8221; to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if &#8220;the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the RLD.&#8221; Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates that the generic product is &#8220;therapeutically equivalent&#8221; to the RLD and it assigns a therapeutic equivalence rating to the approved generic drug in its publication &#8220;Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,&#8221; also referred to as the &#8220;Orange Book.&#8221; Physicians and pharmacists consider the therapeutic equivalence rating to mean that a generic drug is fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA&#8217;s designation of a therapeutic equivalence rating often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 

Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of nonpatent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of data exclusivity for new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.

Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant&#8217;s product or a method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. 

Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the required patent information has not been filed; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the listed patent has expired; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. 

&#160;

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product&#8217;s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicat e that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 

To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 

Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA&#8217;s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 

The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA&#8217;s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot accept or approve another application. 

Patent Term Restoration and Extension 

A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Those Amendments permit a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a NDA, plus the time between the submission date of a NDA and ultimate approval. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.

&#160;

Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 

In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.

Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial applications must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 

To obtain marketing approval of a drug under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application (MAA) either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. 

The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. 

Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) established at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a drug. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 

The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state&#8217;s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. 

If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 

&#160;

Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union 

In the European Union, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator&#8217;s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator&#8217;s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its product. 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as, in the United States, Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 

In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not necessarily imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 

The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, risk sharing, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals. As a result, the marketability of any product which receives regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. 

In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&#8217; share of sales to federal health care programs. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products that receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 

&#160;

In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countri es may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system o f direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healt h care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competi tive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. 

Healthcare Laws and Regulation 

Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits, among other things, U.S. corporations and their persons acting on their behalf from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, including certain healthcare professionals in many countries, in an attempt to obtain or retain business or otherwise seek preferential treatment abroad; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, making a false statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests; and 

&#160;

&#8226; 

analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers. 

Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
