 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Cavitation Technologies, Inc. (referred to herein, unless otherwise indicated, as &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;CTi,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221;) is a Nevada corporation originally incorporated under the name Bio Energy, Inc. We have developed, patented, and commercialized proprietary technology that may be used in liquid processing applications. Our patented Nano Reactor&#174; is the critical component of our CTi Nano Neutralization&#174; System which has been shown to reduce operating costs and increase yields in refining vegetable oils. We have 3 issued patents for device/apparatus and another 8 for processes in the US, as well as 1 patent issued for process in Singapore. We have also filed 6 patent applications in the US and another 9 internationally to employ our proprietary technology in applications including vegetable and oil refining, waste water treatment, algae oil extraction, and alcoholic beverage enhancement.

&#160;

In addition, we have commercialized our CTi Nano Neutralization&#174; System in the refining process of certain vegetable oils which has proven to reduce costs and increase yields for our customers.

&#160;

Vegetable Oil Refining 

&#160;

Our first commercial application for our technology is the CTi Nano Neutralization&#174; System . Our environmentally friendly process has been shown to reduce refining costs, increase oil yield, and limit the amount of chemical additives used in chemical refining vegetables oils. This patented process (US Patent # 8,911,808) is designed to be incorporated into new and existing soybean, rapeseed, and canola oil chemical refineries.

&#160;

Our first pilot test of our CTi NANO Neutralization System was conducted in 2010 at Carolina Soya, a 200 metric ton/day crude soy oil refining plant in Estill, South Carolina. Our second system, which became operational in fiscal 2011, is a 450 metric tons per day plant that has been in continuous operation since. We have successfully shipped over 24 systems both domestically and abroad.

&#160;

The global demand for vegetable oils has grown consistently at a rate of about 5.5% p.a. from 84.5 million metric tons in 1999 to over 175 million metric tons in 2015-2016 (https://www.statista.com/statistics/263937/vegetable-oils-global-consumption/). It is also a highly competitive commodity market in which the lowest-cost producer has the advantage.

&#160;

Desmet Ballestra Agreement 

&#160;

On May 14, 2012 we signed a global R and D, Marketing and Technology License Agreement with Desmet Ballestra Group s.a. (Desmet), a Belgian company that is actively marketing the NANO Neutralization System, the key component of which is the Company&#8217;s reactor to soybean and other vegetable oil refiners. The Agreement provided Desmet (licensee) a limited, exclusive license and right to develop, design and supply Nano Reactor&#174; systems which incorporate Nano Reactor&#174; devices on a global basis but was limited to oils and fats and oleo chemical applications. We, as the licensor, remained the owner of the current patents and patent applications but Desmet would be the co-owner of any new process patent applications jointly developed. Desmet provided, under certain conditions, limited monthly advance payments of $125,000 against future sales to us through May 2015. This Agreement terminated May 2015.

&#160;

On January 22, 2016, we signed a similar three-year agreement with Desmet effective August 1, 2015. As part of the agreement, Desmet is to provide, under certain conditions, limited monthly advance payments of $50,000 against future sales to us. The agreement may be terminated by Desmet every August 1 should Desmet and its affiliates fail to convert a minimum of six Nano Reactors System to sold status during the period of June 1 to May 31. The agreement may also be terminated in case were to lose its rights under the patents and patent applications being used in our CTi NANO Neutralization System. 

&#160;

Desmet, together with its affiliates, is a global engineering and equipment supply firm engaged in the development, design and supply of process equipment for oils and fats processing facilities including vegetable oil refining, biofuel, oleo chemical, seed crushing, surfactant and detergent markets. Desmet supplies these markets with services based on the latest globally sourced technologies. Desmet has relationships with major refiners globally A significant portion of global vegetable oil refineries include major refiners such as Archer Daniels Midland Company, Cargill, Inc. and Bunge Limited. Desmet has more than 40 sales representatives selling in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Since its founding in 1946, Desmet reports that it has built a global network that includes 1,300 employees, 17 global and 8 representative offices, and more than 5,700 lines in a variety of applications. Desmet operates a separate division for each of the above markets and the Desmet Oils &#38; Fats division has supplied small and large plants to approximately 1,700 oil millers in 150 countries, covering over 6,000 process sections. We have developed a relationship with the North American arm of Desmet which operates in each of these markets and provides us with other potential opportunities such as palm oil refining.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We and Desmet have worked together to determine the appropriate sales approach and installation process. Our CTi Nano Neutralization System is designed to be used as an add-on process to an existing neutralization system within soybean and other vegetable oil refineries. Desmet is now focused on marketing our CTi&#8217;s Nano Neutralization&#174; System to vegetable oil refiners to help them increase profits through cost savings and improved oil yields. Desmet purchases our CTi Nano Neutralization Reactor Systems from us and installs them at the refinery as part of an integrated neutralization system. Based on successful commercial implementations, Desmet guarantees minimum economic benefits to a facility that installs our CTi Nano Neutralization&#174; Systems . We are therefore substantially dependent on Desmet to identify prospects, complete sales contracts, install the system and manage relationships with end-users. We focus on developing additional Nano Reactor&#174; applications and managing the intellectual property issues associated with new developments.

&#160;

Customers/ Dependence on One Customer 

&#160;

We continue to sell our Nano Reactors and technology only to one customer, Desmet and they are responsible for installing and servicing the systems. All of our revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 was derived from sales of products to Desmet.

&#160;

Sources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers 

&#160;

We have historically sourced reactor components from various domestic and international suppliers including Canyon Engineering, EA365 Management, NH Management., Inc. and Strategic IR with whom we have no long term contracts, agreements, or commitments. They provide parts as directed. We believe it would take approximately 60 days to find a new supplier, if necessary.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Our competitors who sell equipment and engineering services for the vegetable oil refining business are a myriad of companies both large and small that provide equipment and technology to oil refiners. These include known companies that have longer operating histories, more experience, and stronger financial capabilities. Competitors include Westfalia, Alfa Laval, and Crown Iron Works as well as many firms that provide advice and services to small and regional firms. In addition, Arisdyne Systems, a designer of cavitation devices, is marketing a system using similar technology. The vegetable oil refining business is a highly competitive commodity market in which where the lowest-cost producer has the advantage. We intend to compete by offering solutions that help our clients remain or become a low-cost producer. Because the industry in which we compete has had limited new technology introduced in the last 50 years, we believe our CTi Nano Neutralization&#174; Systems provide a unique opportunity for refiners to increase margins. We seek to differentiate ourselves by offering solutions based on our proprietary and patented designs, processes, and applications to help our clients described in our issued and patent pending applications. We compete by offering solutions that we believe can reduce operating expenses and increase yield vis-&#224;-vis their current applied technology.

&#160;

Patents 

&#160;

Our Cavitation Generator patent was issued during fiscal 2011. In addition, we have a patent for our Multi-State Cavitation Device that was issued August 22, 2011. In the fiscal 2014 we received approvals for another 3 patents in the US for various processes. During fiscal years 2015 and 2016, we also received approvals in the US for another 5 patents for various processes and 1 for another device/apparatus. We also received 1 patent approval for its device in Singapore.

&#160;

We also have 6 US and 9 PCT/ international patent applications pending which apply to the design of our reactor and the processes related thereto. We filed a number of process patent applications incorporating these patented devices for processing fluids in vegetable oil refining, waste water treatment, algae oil extraction, and alcoholic beverage enhancement. We received comments from the United States Patent and Trademark Office with regard to our Method for Cavitation-Assisted Refining, Degumming, and Dewaxing of Oil and Fat, and we responded. We also received a second round of comments and are responding to those as well. There is no assurance that our patents pending will be ultimately issued.

&#160;

We believe our technology can be applied to other liquid processing industries where there is a need to solve environmental problems, reduce operating costs, and/or improve quality and yield. Our issued and allowed patents and pending patents support potential applications of the Company&#8217;s proprietary technology in markets which include, but are not limited to, vegetable oils refining, renewable fuel production, alcoholic beverage enhancement, water purification, and algae oil extraction. In addition, we believe our proprietary technology may also be applied to fuel mixing and crude oil refining. During fiscal 2011, we received the &#8220;CE Marking&#8221; certification which allows us to market our systems in the European Union. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents, maintain trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others both in the United States and other countries. There can be no assurances that patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that the rights granted hereunder will provide proprietary protection or competitive advantage to us. We plan to continue to invest in R&#38;D and file for new and improved patents.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Royalty Agreements 

&#160;

On July 1, 2008, our wholly owned subsidiary entered into Patent Assignment Agreements with two parties, our President as well as our former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and current Technology Senior Manager, where certain devices and methods involved in the hydrodynamic cavitation processes invented by the President and former CEO/current Technology Senior Manager have been assigned to the subsidiary. In exchange, that subsidiary agreed to pay a royalty of 5% of gross revenues to each of the President and former CEO/current Technology Senior Manager for licensing of the technology and leasing of the related equipment embodying the technology. These agreements were subsequently assumed by us on May 13, 2010 from our subsidiary. Our former CEO/current Technology Senior Manager and President both waived their rights to receive royalty payments that have accrued, or that may accrue, on any gross revenue generated through June 30, 2016.

&#160;

On April 30, 2008 and as amended on November 22, 2010, our wholly owned subsidiary entered into an employment agreement with its former Director of Chemical and Analytical Department (the &#8220;Inventor&#8221;) to pay, in the first year, an amount equal to 5% of actual gross revenue received by us on any patent for which the Inventor was a legally named inventor, and, in each subsequent year, 3% of actual gross revenue received by us on any such patent. Since entering into that employment agreement, and during the term of this employment agreement, we have not received any revenue on any patents for which the Inventor was a legally named inventor.

&#160;

Governmental Approval and Regulations and Environmental Compliance 

&#160;

Due to the nature of our products, we have incurred no costs with respect to environmental compliance with federal, state, and local laws. To our knowledge, our products do not require governmental approval, and we do not foresee that governmental regulations will have a material impact on our business.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

On June 30, 2016 we had four full-time employees and had engaged several consultants and independent contractors over the past year. Members of our staff and technical team are comprised of experienced professionals who are chemists, civil-, chemical-, and mechanical engineers with expertise in hydrodynamic cavitation, Nano technology, and water treatment. These individuals hold degrees in Civil, Chemical, and Mechanical Engineering.

&#160;
