Overview 

We are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company committed to the discovery, development and commercialization of product candidates for patients with cystic fibrosis, or CF. Our lead product candidate, N91115, is a small molecule compound that addresses a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR, resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene, the underlying cause of CF. We believe N91115 is a first &#8209;in &#8209;class CFTR stabilizer that modulates CFTR activity through inhibition of S-nitrosoglutathione reductase, or GSNOR. GSNOR inhibition is a novel mechanism of action that we expect to be complementary to existing and future CFTR modulators. N91115 is the only clinical stage product candidate we know of designed to stabilize CFTR inside the cell and at the cell surface. We have shown in preclinical studies that the stabilizing effect of N91115 significantly increases and prolongs CFTR activity when added to other CFTR modulators. Currently, we are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial in CF patients who have two copies of the F508del mutation, the most common CFTR mutation. This trial is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of N91115 in a triple therapy with two other CFTR modulators, lumacaftor/ivacaftor, which were developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and have been approved for use in CF patients in the United States and Europe. We believe this triple therapy will improve patient outcomes and, ultimately, become a new standard of care in CF. 

CF is a life &#8209;shortening genetic disease that affects an estimated 70,000 people worldwide, including approximately 65,000 in the United States and Europe. There is no known cure for CF and the predicted median age of survival in the United States is approximately 41 years. CF is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes CFTR, a chloride channel that regulates the movement of salt and water into and out of cells. Defective CFTR results in decreased chloride secretion leading to the buildup of thick mucus in the lungs and other vital organs. Lung disease, the most critical manifestation of CF, is characterized by airway obstruction, infection and inflammation, such that more than 90% 

&#160;

of all CF patients die of respiratory failure. CF patients typically require lifelong treatment, with multiple daily medications, and frequently require hospitalization and potentially lung transplantation. 

The focus of CF treatment has shifted from palliative care to the advancement of disease modifying CFTR modulators that target CFTR mutations. The most prevalent CFTR mutation is F508del, found in approximately 86% of CF patients in the United States and Europe. F508del patients suffer from a severely defective CFTR protein, which is misfolded, unstable and subject to increased degradation. In the United States, approximately 47% of CF patients are homozygous and have two copies of this mutation, and approximately 39% are heterozygous and have one copy. Due to the complexity of defects associated with the F508del mutation, we believe that effective treatment strategies in patients with this mutation will require multiple therapies with distinct mechanisms of action. 

In patients with CF, decreased CFTR activity is due in part to reduced levels of S &#8209;nitrosoglutathione, or GSNO, which is regulated by GSNO reductase, or GSNOR. GSNO modifies the function of certain CFTR chaperone proteins, and thereby improves the stability of F508del CFTR. Our preclinical studies have shown that N91115 is a selective and reversible inhibitor of GSNOR, and that GSNOR inhibition increases GSNO levels. The ultimate goal of our CFTR stabilizing therapy is to increase and prolong CFTR activity through GSNOR inhibition when N91115 is administered along with other CFTR modulators, thereby increasing chloride transport. 

Our N91115 development program is currently focused on demonstrating the clinical benefit of a triple CFTR modulator therapy for CF patients homozygous for F508del. This triple therapy includes N91115, our CFTR stabilizer, administered with Vertex&#8217;s CFTR corrector, lumacaftor, and its CFTR potentiator, ivacaftor. We filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, for the commencement of clinical trials of N91115 with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, on December 30, 2013. To date, we have completed dose escalation and drug-drug interaction trials in healthy subjects, a pharmacokinetic trial in CF patients, and a Phase 1b clinical trial that assessed safety and tolerability in CF patients who were homozygous for F508del. The goal of our Phase 2 clinical trial is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the triple therapy of N91115 along with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in CF patients homozygous for F508del. For this clinical trial, we are enrolling patients who are already being treated with commercially available lumacaftor/ivacaftor, and we expect to report top line results in the second half of 2016. We also intend to assess the efficacy of N91115 in CF patients with other mutations. 

We own exclusive rights to N91115 in the United States and all other major markets, including U.S. composition of matter patent protection until at least 2031. We also received orphan drug and fast track designation for N91115 in early 2016, which provides us with certain marketing exclusivity and other benefits. Initially, we plan to pursue regulatory approval for N91115 in the regions where lumacaftor/ivacaftor is commercially available. Given the well &#8209;characterized and clearly identified patient populations with CF, we plan to independently commercialize N91115 upon approval. 

Our Strategy 

Our primary strategy is to establish N91115 as an essential component of the standard of care in CF. Key elements of our overall strategy include: 

&#183; 

Rapidly advancing N91115 through clinical development to regulatory approval. We are currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial of N91115 and we expect to report top line results in the second half of 2016. This trial is designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of N91115 in a triple therapy along with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in CF patients homozygous for F508del. We received orphan drug designation for N91115 in the treatment of CF in January 2016 and fast track designation in February 2016 . At the completion of Phase 2, we intend to seek breakthrough designation for N91115 and plan to proceed to a Phase 3 program in order to support regulatory approval of N91115. 

&#183; 

Developing N91115 as an essential component of a new standard of care in CF, agnostic to other CFTR modulators, effective across multiple mutations and in all age groups. In addition to lumacaftor and ivacaftor, there are other CFTR modulators that target CFTR activity currently under development or that may be developed in the future. We intend to expand the development of N91115 by testing it with other 

&#160;

CFTR modulators if, and as, they become available. We also intend to expand the development of N91115, which is currently focused on CF patients homozygous for F508del, to address other CF mutations, beginning with CF patients heterozygous for F508del with N91115 added to ivacaftor . Further, we plan to develop N91115 for pediatric patients as part of a therapy with other approved CFTR modulators. 

&#183; 

Independently commercializing N91115. We own exclusive rights to N91115 in the United States and all other major markets. Initially, we plan to pursue regulatory approval for N91115 in the regions where lumacaftor/ivacaftor is commercially available. Given the well &#8209;characterized and clearly identified patient populations with CF, we plan to independently commercialize N91115. Our commercialization strategy will target key prescribing physicians and advocacy groups, as well as provide patients with support programs, ensure product access and secure reimbursement. 

&#183; 

Utilizing our proprietary GSNOR inhibitor portfolio and know &#8209;how to develop additional product candidates addressing other diseases. We believe that the characteristics of our GSNOR inhibitor portfolio enable us, independently or with strategic partners, to potentially develop and commercialize a pipeline of GSNOR inhibitors for the treatment of patients with diseases other than CF. 

Advantages of N91115 

We believe N91115 has the following advantages that support rapid and successful development: 

&#183; 

N91115 is a first &#8209;in &#8209;class CFTR stabilizer that increases and prolongs CFTR activity via a novel mechanism of action, GSNOR inhibition. The goal of CF therapy is to maximize CFTR activity. We believe this can be best accomplished by employing a combination of CFTR modulators that work together. In patients who are homozygous for F508del, lumacaftor/ivacaftor has shown a statistically significant yet modest clinical benefit. We believe this is because the CFTR protein remains unstable and requires an additional CFTR modulator to stabilize its activity. Our preclinical data demonstrate that the addition of our first &#8209;in &#8209;class CFTR stabilizer, N91115, to non &#8209;formulated lumacaftor and ivacaftor significantly improves CFTR activity. We believe that this effect is due to the restoration of GSNO levels through GSNOR inhibition. GSNOR inhibition modifies CFTR chaperone proteins, resulting in CFTR stabilization inside the cell and at the cell surface. This increases and prolongs CFTR activity thereby increasing chloride transport, which we believe will improve patient outcomes. 

&#183; 

N91115 is well positioned for continued clinical development based on existing data. We believe that N91115 is positioned for successful clinical development based on its preclinical safety and efficacy, and its clinical safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic, profiles. Data from the Phase 1b clinical trial showed no dose limiting toxicity and a trend toward a reduction in sweat chloride, a marker of CFTR modulation, at the highest dose tested. This data suggests that a maximum effective dose has not been reached and supports the testing of a higher dose in the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial. In addition, animal toxicology studies provide safety margins of at least 4 times higher than the highest dose in our Phase 2 clinical trial. 

&#183; 

N91115 is optimized to be administered along with other CFTR modulators and can be dosed orally. We believe that the treatment of CF requires multiple therapies with distinct mechanisms of action. Therefore, we optimized the structure of N91115 through our discovery screening program to limit off target effects and minimize interaction with drug metabolizing enzymes. In addition, N91115 can be dosed orally, with a dosing frequency that is similar to other CFTR modulator therapies. 

&#183; 

N91115 is protected by a strong intellectual property portfolio. We believe N91115, a first &#8209;in &#8209;class CFTR stabilizer, increases and prolongs CFTR activity when administered alone and with other CFTR modulators. We own exclusive rights to N91115 in the United States and all other major markets, including U.S. composition of matter patent protection until at least 2031.

Market Overview 

Background on Cystic Fibrosis 

CF is a life &#8209;shortening genetic disease that affects an estimated 70,000 people worldwide, including approximately 65,000 in the United States and Europe. There is no known cure for CF and the predicted median age of survival in the United States is approximately 41 years. The prevalence of CF is expected to increase at an average annual rate of 0.8% between now and 2023. The main driver of this growth is increased life expectancy due to the emergence of disease modifying therapies. CF patients typically require lifelong treatment with multiple daily medications, and frequently require hospitalization and potentially lung transplantation. 

CF is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes CFTR, a chloride channel that regulates the movement of salt and water into and out of cells in organs such as the lungs, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. CF occurs only in patients with two defective copies, or alleles, of the CFTR gene. In CF patients, defective CFTR cannot perform its normal function, which results in the buildup of thick mucus in the lungs and other vital organs. Lung disease is the most critical manifestation of CF, characterized by airway obstruction, infection and inflammation that allow bacteria to grow unfettered and impair the lung&#8217;s immune system. More than 90% of all CF patients die of respiratory failure. In the pancreas, damage caused by CF leads to diabetes, while the buildup of mucus prevents the release of digestive enzymes that help the body break down food and absorb important nutrients. In the gastrointestinal tract, the thick mucus contributes to further impairment of nutrient absorption. 

There are more than 1,800 known mutations in the CFTR gene, including the most prevalent mutation, the F508del mutation, which is found in approximately 86% of all CF patients in the United States and Europe. In the F508del mutation, the deletion of an amino acid results in misfolded CFTR that is unstable and is targeted for degradation, which is facilitated by chaperone proteins. As a result, not enough CFTR reaches, or &#8220;traffics&#8221; to, the cell surface. F508del is therefore referred to as a trafficking mutation. In the United States, approximately 47% of CF patients are homozygous and have two copies of this mutation, and approximately 39% are heterozygous and have one copy. Other CFTR mutations include gating mutations, such as G551D that is found in approximately 4% of all CF patients. Cells with gating mutations have normal amounts of CFTR at the cell surface, but the channels fail to open, or &#8220;gate,&#8221; properly. 

Current Approaches to Treatment 

Historically, palliative therapies were the only treatment options to manage the symptoms of CF, but these do not address the underlying cause of the disease. Palliative therapies primarily include inhaled therapies to manage respiratory complications and to suppress infections, and oral therapies to improve nutrient absorption. The focus of CF therapy has shifted from palliative care to the advancement of disease modifying CFTR modulators to address the underlying cause of CF. Unlike palliative therapies, CFTR modulators are designed to address abnormalities, such as trafficking and gating defects, caused by specific mutations in the CFTR gene. Current views on disease modifying therapies are evolving to consider the need for multiple mechanisms of action to improve the activity of the CFTR channel. New and emerging disease modifying product candidates create the opportunity to address defective CFTR with the ultimate goal of increasing chloride secretion. 

Palliative Treatments 

Palliative treatments primarily include inhaled therapies to manage mucus accumulation and additional respiratory complications, and to suppress infections. For example, Novartis&#8217; TOBI and Gilead&#8217;s Cayston are used to suppress chronic lung infections, and Roche&#8217;s inhaled Pulmozyme is used to thin mucus. In addition, the approval of Raptor&#8217;s Quinsair&#8482;, an inhaled antibiotic, in Europe and Canada, and Pharmaxis&#8217;s Bronchitol &#174;, a mucolytic agent, in Europe , are expected to provide new options for chronic bacterial infections and airway clearance. Palliative treatments also include oral therapies such as pancreatic enzyme replacement to address nutrient absorption. We believe that palliative therapies will continue to be used together with disease modifying therapies. 

&#160;

Disease Modifying Treatments 

To date, disease modifying therapies in CF primarily include two types of CFTR modulators, correctors and potentiators, or a combination of both. There are also product candidates in development that seek to address the underlying cause of CF via different mechanisms of action. We summarize the key disease modifying therapies in the following table:

Correctors and Potentiators 

Potentiators are designed to keep the chloride channel open, or potentiate, in CFTR mutations called &#8220;gating&#8221; mutations, such as G551D. Cells with gating mutations have normal amounts of CFTR at the cell surface, but the chloride channels fail to open properly, as illustrated below. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Correctors are designed to modulate a more severe CFTR mutation, F508del, which is the most common CFTR mutation. With the F508del &#8220;trafficking&#8221; mutation, the abnormal CFTR protein does not fold correctly and is therefore unstable. The misfolded CFTR protein degrades inside the cell and does not reach, or traffic to, the cell surface. Correctors are designed to improve F508del CFTR folding and trafficking, thereby resulting in increased levels of protein at the cell surface, as illustrated below. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Ivacaftor (potentiator) for G551D and other gating mutations. Vertex&#8217;s ivacaftor, marketed as Kalydeco &#8482; , was the first CFTR modulator to be approved in CF. In 2012, ivacaftor was approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of the G551D gating mutation, in 2014, approval was expanded to include additional gating mutations, and in 2015 approval was expanded further to include the R117H mutation. Ivacaftor is designed to keep the chloride channel open longer. It has demonstrated significant clinical benefits in CF patients who carry a gating mutation, such as, the G551D mutation, including a 10.6% absolute increase in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second, or ppFEV 1 , a measure of lung function, and improvement in other secondary endpoints compared to placebo. 

Lumacaftor/ivacaftor (corrector/potentiator) for F508del homozygous patients. Vertex&#8217;s lumacaftor was the first CFTR corrector to be developed. It was designed to improve CFTR folding, and thus trafficking, to the cell surface. When lumacaftor was used by itself as a CFTR modulator, it did not improve lung function in CF patients homozygous for the F508del mutation, so Vertex then tested lumacaftor combined with ivacaftor. In June 2014, Vertex announced the results of two Phase 3 trials that combined lumacaftor and ivacaftor in F508del CFTR homozygous patients. While lumacaftor/ivacaftor demonstrated a statistically significant absolute improvement in the primary endpoint of change in lung function as measured by ppFEV 1 , it was a modest improvement of 3 &#8209;4% compared to the improvement seen with ivacaftor alone in the G551D population. The figure below shows the proposed effect of lumacaftor combined with ivacaftor on F508del CFTR. As illustrated, when lumacaftor binds to F508del CFTR it improves folding and trafficking to the cell surface. When ivacaftor binds to F508del CFTR that has trafficked to the cell surface, the chloride channel opens, but CFTR remains unstable. We have shown in preclinical studies that N91115, when added to non &#8209;formulated lumacaftor and ivacaftor, acts as a stabilizer to significantly increase and prolong CFTR activity. 

&#160;

Trafficking Defect Treated with Corrector Plus Potentiator 

In 2015, Vertex received approval of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in CF patients ages 12 and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Our Phase 2 clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of the triple therapy of N91115 along with lumacaftor/ivacaftor began in November 2015. 

Other CFTR modulators. A number of companies are identifying and developing other CFTR modulators for the treatment of CF including Vertex, Novartis, Galapagos, Concert, Proteostasis, Flatley Discovery Labs, PTC Therapeutics and ProQR Therapeutics. However, to our knowledge, these companies are developing CFTR correctors, potentiators, and amplifiers, not CFTR stabilizers. We believe that N91115 could be complementary to many of these other CFTR modulators, if they are successfully developed. 

Other Disease Modifying Therapies 

Several companies are identifying and developing disease modifying therapies for the treatment of CF that employ a different approach from CFTR modulation and have different mechanisms of action. For example, ProQR aims to repair the F508del mutation at the mRNA level. Its approach is designed to restore expression of normal CFTR protein that can normalize fluid transport in key organs affected by CF, particularly the lung. PTC Therapeutics is developing Ataluren for the treatment of CF caused by a particular mutation known as a nonsense mutation. Ataluren is intended to interact with the ribosome, which is the component of the cell that decodes mRNA and manufactures proteins, to enable the cell to produce a full &#8209;length, functional protein. Vertex, in collaboration with Parion, is developing ENaC inhibitors, designed to block the epithelial sodium channel in the lung and improve hydration. We believe that N91115 could be added to these and other disease modifying therapies as CFTR protein stability may remain an issue. 

&#160;

Our Novel Approach 

N91115 Triple Therapy in CF Patients Homozygous for F508del 

Our development program is initially focused on the triple therapy of N91115 along with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in CF patients homozygous for F508del. We also plan to advance N91115 into other mutation classes, beginning with patients who have one copy of the F508del mutation and one copy of a gating mutation in the second half of 2016. We believe that N91115 is a first &#8209;in &#8209;class CFTR stabilizer, a new type of CFTR modulator that increases and prolongs CFTR activity when added to other CFTR modulators. We have demonstrated this improvement in CFTR activity in preclinical studies when N91115 was added to non &#8209;formulated lumacaftor and ivacaftor, and when N91115 was used as the sole CFTR modulator in preclinical studies. In our Phase 1b clinical trial, N91115 showed a trend toward a reduction in sweat chloride at the highest dose tested which was statistically significant using a within group comparison and may provide evidence of CFTR modulation in CF patients . 

N91115 is a GSNOR Inhibitor Designed to Improve F508del CFTR Stability 

We have shown in preclinical studies that N91115 is a selective and reversible inhibitor of GSNOR and that GSNOR inhibition increases GSNO levels. By increasing GSNO levels, N91115 increases and prolongs CFTR activity. In patients with CF, decreased CFTR activity is due in part to reduced levels of GSNO, which is regulated by GSNOR. GSNO is the human body&#8217;s most abundant low molecular weight S &#8209;nitrosothiol, or SNO. While SNOs are normally present in the human airway, concentrations tend to be reduced in CF patients. In the CF patient&#8217;s lung, the depleted GSNO levels adversely affect CFTR activity. 

CFTR has been shown to interact with a large number of chaperone proteins, which are believed to play essential roles in CFTR activity, contributing to its folding, trafficking and residence time at the cell surface. The role and involvement of chaperone proteins in the processing of CFTR has been well &#8209;documented. Studies have shown that modulating chaperones by reducing the temperature of the cell or using certain chemical agents can increase F508del CFTR trafficking and extend the half life of CFTR at the cell surface, thereby stabilizing the chloride channel. Some of these chaperones include the Hsp70/90 organizing protein, or HOP, calnexin, the C terminus of Hsp70 interacting protein, or CHIP, and the cysteine string protein, or Csp. GSNO modifies the function of certain CFTR chaperone proteins through a process known as nitrosation. For example, studies have shown that GSNO nitrosates and thus modifies the function of HOP. This modification of HOP reduces the degradation of CFTR, increases the maturation, or function, of CFTR and increases the stability of CFTR inside the cell and at the cell surface. The net result of modifying chaperone proteins is increased and prolonged CFTR activity. 

The figure below illustrates how the addition of N91115 inhibits GSNOR restoring GSNO levels thereby leading to the modification of HOP. 

&#160;

Addition of N91115 Restores GSNO Levels 

and Increases Nitrosation of HOP 

The expected stabilizing mechanism of action of N91115 when administered with a CFTR corrector and potentiator is illustrated in the figure below. By decreasing degradation of the misfolded CFTR, as illustrated by Steps 1 and 2, N91115 permits more CFTR to bind to a corrector, which is designed to improve folding, as illustrated by Step 3. The folded CFTR then traffics to the cell surface where a potentiator can bind to it, opening the chloride channel, as illustrated by Steps 4 and 5. However, as preclinical data have suggested, CFTR bound to correctors such as lumacaftor or VX-661 and the potentiator, ivacaftor, at the cell surface remains unstable and degrades. The net effect of N91115 is to increase and prolong CFTR activity by increasing its stability at the cell surface, as illustrated by Step 6, and inside the cell, as illustrated by Step 2. 

&#160;

N91115 Mechanism Of Action 

Clinical Development for N91115 

Phase 2 

We are currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a triple therapy of N91115 along with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in 135 adult CF patients homozygous for F508del. We expect to report top line results from this trial in the second half of 2016. This Phase 2 trial will be conducted in patients already being treated with commercially available lumacaftor/ivacaftor as prescribed by their physician and reimbursed accordingly. We are not paying for lumacaftor/ivacaftor in these trials. 

The Phase 2 clinical trial is designed to detect whether or not the administration of N91115 with lumacaftor/ivacaftor results in a significant improvement in lung function. The trial will assess two different doses of N91115 when administered for up to 12 weeks. The planned primary efficacy endpoint is absolute change in ppFEV 1 . Other secondary efficacy endpoints include the relative change in pp &#160; FEV 1 and the concentration of chloride in sweat, among others. This trial is intended to provide proof of concept data showing the efficacy of N91115 added to a corrector/potentiator combination in this patient population. 

We also intend to evaluate the effects of N91115 added to ivacaftor in adult CF patients heterozygous for F508del and a gating mutation. This evaluation will begin with a proof of concept Phase 2 clinical trial that is planned to start in the second half of 2016. 

At the completion of Phase 2, we intend to seek breakthrough designation for N91115 in either or both CF populations and plan to proceed to a Phase 3 program in order to support regulatory approval of N91115. 

&#160;

Phase 3 

We expect the Phase 3 clinical program to include two randomized, placebo &#8209;controlled clinical trials that will be designed to show a clinically meaningful benefit of N91115 in a triple therapy along with lumacaftor/ivacaftor, and possibly a double therapy along with ivacaftor. We also expect the Phase 3 program to include a larger number of patients than in the Phase 2 trials. 

Clinical Development to Date 

In 2015, we completed a Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of N91115 in adult CF patients homozygous for F508del. This trial met its stated objectives by demonstrating no dose-limiting toxicities of N91115 and informing dose selection for our Phase 2 clinical trial. The Phase 1b trial was a randomized, double &#8209;blind, placebo &#8209;controlled, parallel group trial with three doses of N91115, at 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg, administered twice daily. These doses and a placebo were administered over 28 days in a total of 51 patients. An independent data safety and monitoring board, or DSMB, reviewed unblinded safety data from the trial and provided us with periodic reports regarding its recommendations relative to continuation criteria. At the completion of the trial, the DSMB concluded that there were no dose limiting toxicities observed with N91115. We reported the top line results from this trial in September 2015 and presented the results at the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference in October 2015. The data showed a trend toward a reduction in sweat chloride at the highest dose tested which was statistically significant using a within group comparison. The lack of dose limiting toxicity and a potential sweat chloride signal supported the inclusion of a higher dose in the ongoing Phase 2 trial in which doses of 200 and 400 mg administered twice daily are being assessed. 

We have completed four Phase 1 trials of N91115 to date, including the Phase 1b trial described above. In these trials, a total of 51 healthy subjects and 45 CF patients have received N91115. Our first clinical trial of N91115 was a multiple ascending dose, safety and pharmacokinetic trial in healthy subjects. N91115 was well tolerated with no dose &#8209;limiting toxicities noted up to 500 mg per day. In this trial, four cohorts each with six healthy subjects received 14 &#8209;day dosing at 10 mg, 50 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg per day and two cohorts each with six healthy subjects received single doses of 50 mg and 250 mg. 

Our second Phase 1 trial of N91115 was an open &#8209;label trial in CF patients homozygous for the F508del mutation. Six CF patients were dosed with 50 mg of N91115 twice daily for 14 days. The AUC in the CF patients was 97% of that in healthy subjects from our first Phase 1 trial. This trial showed that no dosing adjustments would be required for CF patients. 

Our third Phase 1 trial was the trial described above in F508del homozygous patients and our fourth trial was a drug-drug interaction study using Rifampin as a surrogate for lumacaftor/ivacaftor because of its similar drug metabolizing properties. The drug-drug interaction trial was conducted in preparation for dose selection for Phase 2 and no adjustment of the N91115 dose was required on the basis of the results of this trial. 

N91115 exhibited linear plasma level exposures with increases in dose resulting in proportional increases in both maximum plasma levels, or C max , and area under the curve, or AUC, for plasma concentration versus time in healthy subjects and CF patients. There was no significant systemic drug accumulation detected up to 28 days of administration. 

To date, there have been no overall human safety issues detected involving either serious or severe adverse events, nor have there been any dose limiting toxicities observed. To date, the accumulated preclinical and clinical data provide a strong basis for the continued study of N91115 in the Phase 2 program. 

Preclinical Studies 

We have conducted in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies that support the development and therapeutic potential of N91115. These studies showed that N91115 significantly increased CFTR activity in cell and animal models homozygous for F508del CFTR. Important anti &#8209;inflammatory effects relevant to CF were also found in other animal models.

The Ussing Chamber assay is widely used to measure CFTR activity, or chloride transport, over a period of time under variable conditions. In these experiments, chloride transport is reflected by the short &#8209;circuit current, or I sc . Forskolin is a compound used to activate CFTR, while CFTR 172 is a compound used to inhibit this stimulated activity. Two different types of Ussing Chamber experiments were used to assess the stabilizing effect of N91115 in F508del CFTR human bronchial epithelial cells, or HBE cells. In the first set of experiments, the administration of N91115 with non &#8209;formulated lumacaftor and ivacaftor resulted in more stable F508del CFTR activity. Representative traces of I sc are shown in the figure below. In the control cells, there was no increase in I sc with forskolin stimulation as expected because F508del CFTR was not present at the cell surface. In the cells treated with non &#8209;formulated lumacaftor and ivacaftor, there was an increase in I sc after forskolin stimulation, but the current decreased rapidly over time as indicated by the steep negative slope in the lumacaftor and ivacaftor curve. In cells treated with non &#8209;formulated lumacaftor and ivacaftor with N91115, there was a similar initial increase in current after forskolin stimulation, but, importantly, there was no rapid decrease in I sc over time, therefore resulting in a greater AUC compared to lumacaftor and ivacaftor alone.

When Added to Non &#8209;formulated Lumacaftor and Ivacaftor 

&#160; 

The figure below illustrates the effect of N91115 on CFTR activity. Chloride transport as measured from forskolin stimulation to inhibition by CFTR 172 is reported as an AUC measurement. We believe that this AUC measurement is the most representative indication of total stimulated CFTR activity. The addition of N91115 to lumacaftor and ivacaftor resulted in a statistically significant, 1.5 times, or 50%, increase in AUC compared to lumacaftor and ivacaftor alone, with a p value of less than 0.01. Results are considered statistically significant when the probability of the results occurring by chance is sufficiently low. When that probability is less than 5%, or p &#60; 0.05, the result is considered statistically significant. N91115 also decreased the rate of decline in CFTR activity. The rate of decline significantly improved 2.2 times with the addition of N91115 to non &#8209;formulated lumacaftor and ivacaftor, with a p value less than 0.05.

N91115 Significantly Increased F508del CFTR Activity 

When Added to Lumacaftor and Ivacaftor in HBEs 

In the second set of experiments, F508del HBE cells were initially treated with just lumacaftor, followed by N91115, ivacaftor and a second potentiator, genistein. Genistein is a chemical compound used exclusively in HBE preclinical studies to potentiate CFTR channels and is not used in the clinic. The administration of N91115 prior to potentiators resulted in a greater degree of chloride secretion compared to lumacaftor and potentiators alone suggesting the availability of more CFTR for potentiation. Representative traces of I sc are shown in the figure below. In the control cells, there was no increase in I sc with forskolin stimulation. In the cells treated initially with lumacaftor, there was an increase in I sc after forskolin stimulation, as well as additional increases after ivacaftor and then another potentiator, genistein, were added. In cells initially treated with lumacaftor and then with N91115, there was a similar initial increase in I sc after forskolin stimulation. However, there was a greater increase in stimulation by the potentiators ivacaftor and genistein, resulting in a greater AUC compared to lumacaftor alone. Total CFTR activity at the end of the experiment that was inhibited by CFTR 172 was also greater when N91115 was added to lumacaftor. 

&#160;

N91115 Added to Lumacaftor Significantly Increased the Effects 

of CFTR Potentiators 

The figure below illustrates the effect of N91115 on CFTR activity reported as an AUC measurement. The addition of N91115 to lumacaftor prior to the addition of potentiators resulted in a statistically significant, 1.5 times, or 50%, increase in AUC compared to lumacaftor and potentiators alone, with a p value of less than 0.01. N91115 also increased the ability of ivacaftor to potentiate CFTR activity by 1.3 times. Total CFTR activity at the end of experiment that was inhibited by CFTR 172 was significantly increased by 1.2 times, with a p value of less than 0.01.

Assessment of Cell Surface Expression of CFTR 

The assessment of the expression of CFTR at the cell surface may provide an important indicator of how much CFTR is available to function as a chloride channel and support the functional data demonstrated in Ussing chamber experiments with N91115. To assess this effect of N91115, CFTR plasma membrane or PM expression was evaluated using a cystic fibrosis cell line &#160; that expresses F508del CFTR , or the CFBE41o- cell line . The CFTR correctors lumacaftor and VX-661, and the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor were also used in the experiment. As shown in the figure below, steady state CFTR PM expression was measured using cells treated with DMSO control, ivacaftor , lumacaftor , VX-661, lumacaftor + ivacaftor , or VX-661 + ivacaftor , with or without the addition of N91115. A statistically significant increase in CFTR PM expression was observed when cells were treated with N91115 alone compared to DMSO control. There was also a &#160; statistically significant increase in CFTR PM expression observed when cells were treated with N91115 in addition to lumacaftor , VX-661, or in combination with either CFTR corrector + ivacaftor (triple combination). I mportantly, the decrease in PM expression observed when cells were treated with either corrector ( lumacaftor or VX-661) plus ivacaftor was reversed back to corrector levels alone with the addition of N91115. CFTR PM densities were determined by cell surface ELISA and are depicted as percentage of DMSO treated controls. These data further support the CFTR stabilizing effects of N91115 both when used as the sole CFTR modulator and when added to a corrector alone or the combination of a corrector and a potentiator.

In Vivo Assay of Intestinal Short &#8209;Circuit Current Measurements in F508del CFTR Mice 

Intestinal current measurements are used to measure CFTR activity in tissue biopsies from CF patients and can be used in a similar manner in F508del CFTR mice. The presence of functional CFTR in normal humans or mice results in positive I sc levels. In humans and mice with the F508del mutation, no CFTR is present at the cell surface and the I sc levels are negative. As illustrated in the figure below, when F508del CFTR mice were treated for seven days with oral N91115 at a dose of 1 mg per kg, the I sc shifted from a negative average level in the control group to a positive average level in the N91115 group. This significant increase in chloride secretion measured by I sc , with a p value less than 0.05, demonstrates the ability of N91115 to increase CFTR activity. These studies also showed that N91115 was orally available and helped define a target therapeutic dose for N91115. 

N91115 Significantly Increased F508del CFTR Activity in CF Mice 

Yellow Fluorescent Protein Assay in Fisher Rat Thyroid Cells 

The addition of N91115 significantly increased CFTR activity by 1.6 times compared to an in &#8209;house corrector alone, with a p value less than 0.01, in Fisher rat thyroid cells expressing F508del CFTR and a halide &#8209;sensitive yellow fluorescent protein, or YFP. These cells were treated overnight either with a corrector alone or a corrector followed by the addition of N91115 for two hours. After overnight incubation, CFTR activity was stimulated by forskolin and potentiated by ivacaftor. A dose &#8209;dependent increase in YFP quenching, which is indicative of increased CFTR activity, was seen when increasing concentrations of N91115 were added. 

These results are consistent with the Ussing Chamber data and intestinal current measurement data, and provide additional evidence to support the complementary effects of N91115 administered with non &#8209;formulated lumacaftor and ivacaftor. We have also demonstrated this effect with other CFTR correctors. 

Anti &#8209;inflammatory Effects of N91115 and Other GSNOR Inhibitors 

Lung disease in CF is characterized by neutrophil dominated airway inflammation. In an 11 &#8209;day, mouse lung inflammation model, the tobacco smoke &#8209;induced increase in the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was significantly inhibited following oral treatment with our GSNOR inhibitors, with a p value less than 0.001, as illustrated with N91115 in the figure below. The effective dose of N91115 in this model, 1 mg per kg, was the same as in 

&#160;

the intestinal current measurement model of F508del mice, providing further support for the selection of a target therapeutic dose in CF patients. 

N91115 Significantly Decreased Inflammatory Cells in 

Mouse Airways Exposed to Tobacco Smoke 

&#160; 

Activated neutrophils release elastase, which has been shown to be an early marker of airway damage in CF, in addition to having a negative impact on the structure and activity of CFTR. In an elastase mouse model, GSNOR inhibitor therapy significantly decreased the progression of lung alveolar wall damage, with a p value of less than 0.01, as measured by airspace enlargement, as illustrated below. 

&#160;

GSNOR Inhibitors Significantly Decreased Elastase &#8209;Induced Lung Damage 

Preclinical Safety Studies 

We conducted repeat oral &#8209;dose, 28 and 90 &#8209;day toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs. These species are routinely selected for toxicology testing and were deemed appropriate for small molecule inhibitors of GSNOR. All three species exhibited toxicities that were generally mild and occurred at higher exposures than intended in man. For example, in the 90 &#8209;day studies, the levels at which adverse effects were noted provide approximately 8 times safety margins in mice, the most sensitive species compared with the highest dose to be tested in humans. The toxicology data generated thus far suggest the kidney, liver and possibly bone marrow may be target organs. These data provide support for human clinical trials with durations up to 12 weeks. Long &#8209;term toxicity studies will be completed prior to initiation of our Phase 3 program. 

Other Development Programs 

N91115 Additional CF Opportunities 

We also plan to expand the therapeutic potential of N91115 in CF. In addition to lumacaftor and ivacaftor, there are other CFTR modulators currently under development or that may be developed in the future. We intend to expand the development of N91115 by testing it with other modulators if, and as, they become available. We also plan to expand the development of N91115, which is currently focused on CF patients homozygous for F508del, to address the unmet need in CF patients heterozygous for F508del and other mutations. We also plan to develop N91115 for pediatric patients when administered with other approved CFTR modulators. 

Other GSNOR Inhibitors 

Our operations to date have focused on discovery and development of our portfolio of GSNOR inhibitors, including N91115 and N6022. N6022 was the first product candidate to emerge from our GSNOR inhibitor portfolio, and was optimized for inhaled delivery with low oral bioavailability. We advanced N6022 into the clinic in an intravenous formulation to explore safety, tolerability and pharmacological attributes of this novel class of compounds. N6022 paved the way for N91115 by establishing initial safety of the class in healthy subjects and patients with CF. In order to provide translational evidence of GSNOR&#8217;s role in lung disease, we initially explored the effects of N6022 in patients with mild asthma. N6022 demonstrated a significant effect on the airways in these patients, thus confirming the beneficial effects of N6022 observed in our preclinical studies of asthma. Because an oral dosage form is preferable in CF, a systemic disease that is not confined to the lung, we elected to discontinue further development of N6022 in the 

&#160;

chronic management of CF. We may pursue development of N6022 in an inhaled or intravenous dosage form for other potential indications. 

Our GSNOR inhibitor portfolio includes other compounds with differing chemical structures and properties suitable for oral, inhaled, injectable and topical administration. Preclinical evidence supports a potential role for these compounds in indications such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel disease and certain cardiovascular disorders. We intend to explore the commercial merits for such applications and pursue those that provide the greatest opportunity either alone or in partnership with another pharmaceutical company. 

Non &#8209;GSNOR CFTR Correctors 

To date, two product candidates, N1785 and N1861, have emerged from our CFTR corrector portfolio for further optimization. These candidates are designed to target protein folding and have demonstrated the ability to correct CFTR in standard cell &#8209;based, screening assays. These proprietary correctors were used as pharmacologic tools to assess their effects in preclinical studies when administered with GSNOR inhibitors, no further development of these compounds is planned. 

Commercialization 

We own exclusive rights to N91115 in the United States and all other major markets. Initially, we plan to pursue regulatory approval for N91115 in regions where lumacaftor/ivacaftor is commercially available. Given the well &#8209;characterized and clearly identified patient populations with CF, we plan to independently commercialize N91115. Our commercialization strategy will target key prescribing physicians and advocacy groups, as well as provide patients with support programs, ensure product access and secure reimbursement. Outside of North America and Europe, we may seek a partner to commercialize our products. 

Manufacturing and Supply 

We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of preclinical or our planned clinical or commercial quantities of any of our product candidates. We currently contract with two drug substance manufacturers and two drug product manufacturers for the production of N91115, and we expect to continue to do so to meet the preclinical and planned clinical requirements of our product candidates. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these contracted third parties. We expect that in the future we will rely on these and other manufacturers for supply of drug substance and product that will be used in clinical trials of our product candidates. When produced on a commercial scale, we expect that manufacturing costs relating to N91115 will generally be in line with that of other small molecule pharmaceutical compounds. 

Currently, each of our drug starting materials for our manufacturing activities are supplied by two suppliers that we believe have sufficient capacity to meet our demands. We have identified other sources of supply should those be needed in the future and we believe that adequate alternative sources for these supplies exist. However, there is a risk of material harm to our business if supplies are interrupted. We typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long &#8209;term dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements. 

The manufacturing process for N91115 is relatively straightforward and generally in line with other small molecule pharmaceutical compounds in terms of cost and complexity. The process is robust and reproducible within our current specifications, does not require dedicated reactors or specialized equipment, uses common synthetic chemistry and readily available materials, including off &#8209;the &#8209;shelf and made &#8209;to &#8209;order starting materials, and is readily transferable. 

Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements that govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. The contract manufacturers that we use to manufacture our drug substance and drug product do so under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, a regulatory standard for the production of pharmaceuticals. All contract manufacturers used in production have been inspected by the FDA for compliance to cGMP and maintain FDA establishment licenses. 

&#160;

Competition 

The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidates are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of competitors. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for therapies and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors&#8217; products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product candidate we may commercialize and may render our therapies obsolete or non &#8209;competitive before we can recover development and commercialization expenses. 

A number of small and large pharmaceutical companies are identifying and developing disease modifying candidates for the treatment of CF. Vertex&#8217;s ivacaftor, marketed as Kalydeco, and lumacaftor/ivacaftor, marketed as Orkambi&#8482; , are the only drugs currently approved to treat the underlying cause of CF, rather than the symptoms. If these companies develop technologies or product candidates more rapidly than we do, or their technologies are more effective, our ability to develop and successfully commercialize product candidates may be adversely affected. Conversely, the focus on CF and the introduction of newer therapies will expand awareness and acceptance of CF therapies and foster the adoption, uptake and adherence to these disease modifying medicines in potential competitors. Our competitors may also obtain FDA, EMA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. 

Intellectual Property 

We believe that we have a strong patent portfolio and substantial know &#8209;how relating to N91115 and our other product candidates. Our patent portfolio, described more fully below, includes claims directed to CFTR modulator compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and methods of making and using the same. As of December 31, 2015, we are the owner of record of 25 issued U.S. patents and 94 issued non &#8209;U.S. patents. We are actively pursuing an additional 14 U.S. patent applications, including three provisional and 11 non &#8209;provisional U.S. applications, one international patent application and 83 non &#8209;U.S. patent applications in over ten foreign countries. We are the licensee of 6 issued U.S. patents and 7 issued non &#8209;U.S. patents. 

We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including our product candidates and our processes. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our products, their methods of use and processes of manufacture and any other technology to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. 

Our success will depend on the ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights in commercially important technology, inventions and know &#8209;how related to our business, the validity and enforceability of our patents, the continued confidentiality of our trade secrets as well as our ability to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in &#8209;licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 

We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.&#8221; 

&#160;

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non &#8209;provisional priority application. In the United States, a patent&#8217;s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier &#8209;filed patent. 

The term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA &#8209;approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch &#8209;Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a new drug application, or NDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use. 

The patent portfolios for our proprietary technology portfolio and our two most advanced product candidates are summarized below. 

N91115 

The patent portfolio for N91115 includes wholly owned patents and patent applications directed to GSNOR inhibitors including N91115 and other compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, methods of making such pharmaceutical compositions and methods of using such compounds and pharmaceutical compositions. Specific for our N91115 product candidate, we have three issued U.S. patents, pending U.S. patent applications, and corresponding foreign national or regional counterpart patent applications pending in Europe, Japan and other countries. Our U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2031, excluding any additional term that may be available due to a patent term extension. Patents, if issued, based on these pending U.S. and foreign patent applications are expected to expire in 2031, excluding any additional term that may be available due to patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. We also have a pending international application directed to combination therapies. Patents, if issued, based on this pending international patent application, are expected to expire in 2035, excluding any additional term that may be available due to patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. We also have three pending U.S. provisional patent applications directed to various N91115 related inventions. Patents, if issued, based on future patent applications filed claiming priority to these pending U.S. provisional patent applications, are expected to expire in 2036, excluding any additional term that may be available due to patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. 

N6022 

The patent portfolio for N6022 includes wholly owned patents and patent applications directed to GSNOR inhibitors including N6022 and other compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, methods of making such pharmaceutical compositions and methods of using such compounds and pharmaceutical compositions. Specific for our N6022 product candidate, we have five issued U.S. patents, pending U.S. patent applications and corresponding foreign national or regional counterpart patent applications pending in Europe, Japan, and other foreign countries. These five U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2029, excluding any additional term that may be available due to patent term extension. Patents, if issued, based on these pending U.S. and foreign patent applications are expected to expire in 2029 excluding any additional term that may be available due to patent term adjustments or extensions. 

Trade Secrets 

In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know &#8209;how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our proprietary technology portfolio are based on unpatented trade secrets and know &#8209;how. Trade secrets and know &#8209;how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary 

&#160;

information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know &#8209;how and inventions. 

Regulatory Matters 

Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record &#8209;keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing. 

A number of different regulatory agencies may be involved, depending on the product at issue, and the type and stage of activity. These include the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other federal agencies, state boards of pharmacy, state controlled substance agencies and more. 

U.S. Government Regulation 

Drug Development Process 

In the United States, the FDA is a primary regulator of drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and other compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with applicable requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject us to adverse consequences and administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications; withdrawal or restriction of an approval; imposition of a clinical hold or other limitation on research; Warning Letters; product seizures; total or partial suspension of development, production, or distribution; or injunctions, fines, disgorgement, or civil or criminal payments or penalties. 

The process required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#183; 

completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal trials and formulation trials conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, animal welfare laws and other applicable regulations; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials, meaning trials in human subjects, in the United States may begin, obtaining similar authorizations in other jurisdictions where clinical research will be conducted and maintaining these authorizations on a continuing basis throughout the time that trials are performed and new data are collected; 

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well &#8209;controlled clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to demonstrate whether a proposed drug is safe and effective for its intended use; 

&#183; 

preparation and submission to the FDA of a marketing authorization application, such as a new drug application, or NDA, and submitting similar marketing authorization applications in other jurisdictions where commercialization will be pursued; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; and 

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA or other marketing authorization application. 

The development, testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, as well as bearing inherent risk that individual products will not exhibit relevant safety, effectiveness, or quality characteristics. We cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or with the specific terms that we desire, if at all. 

Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

&#183; 

Phase 1. The drug initially is introduced into a small number of healthy human volunteers and is tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. 

&#183; 

Phase 2. Clinical trials are initiated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific targeted diseases, and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 

&#183; 

Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall benefit &#8209;risk profile of the drug candidate and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling. 

Progress reports related to clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and participating IRBs, and more frequent safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and to investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, and certain other purposes. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the healthy volunteers or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the investigational product apparently lacks efficacy. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements or if the drug candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to healthy volunteers or patients. 

We estimate that it generally takes 10 to 15 years, or possibly longer, to discover, develop and bring to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States. Several years may be needed to complete each phase, including discovery, preclinical, Phase 1, 2 or 3, or marketing authorization. 

At times during the development of a new drug product, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA. This commonly occurs prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 testing, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may also be requested. These meetings provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. A plan for pediatric assessment also must be discussed at the end of Phase 2 meeting. 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate, and the manufacturer must develop methods for confirming the identity, quality, purity, and potency of the final products. Additionally, appropriate 

&#160;

packaging must be selected and tested and stability trials must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf &#8209;life and distribution pathway. 

Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 

Sponsors of clinical trials (other than Phase 1 trials) of FDA &#8209;regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, comparator, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of certain trials may be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. However, there are evolving rules and increasing requirements for publication of trial &#8209;related information, and it is possible that data and other information from trials involving drugs that never garner approval could in the future be required to be disclosed. In addition, publication policies of major medical journals mandate certain registration and disclosures as a pre &#8209;condition for potential publication, even when this is not currently mandated as a matter of law. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 

New Drug Application Review and Approval Processes 

The results of drug candidate development, preclinical trials and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug candidate, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug candidate. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees; a waiver of fees may be obtained under limited circumstances. 

The FDA reviews each NDA to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in &#8209;depth review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug candidate is safe and effective for its intended use and indication for use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP &#8209;compliant to assure and preserve the drug candidate&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee consisting of a panel of external experts for review and recommendation as to whether the NDA should be approved and under what conditions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the active ingredient and the formulated drug candidate are manufactured and tested. 

The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical or other data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a Complete Response Letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its present form. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the Complete Response Letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. 

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases, dosages, or indications for use, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post &#8209;approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess a drug&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 

Expedited Development and Review Programs 

The FDA has various programs, including fast track, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation, that are intended to increase agency interactions, expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing 

&#160;

drug candidates, and/or provide for initial approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Generally, drug candidates that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life &#8209;threatening conditions, have the potential to address unmet medical needs and offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. To date, the FDA has granted orphan drug and fast track designations for N91115. However, even if a drug candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification. Moreover, the time period for FDA review may not actually be shortened even if a drug candidate has qualified for an expedited development program. 

If a drug candidate is approved under certain expedited programs, for example, the FDA&#8217;s accelerated approval regulations, the approval may be conditioned upon post &#8209;marketing requirements, including the completion of post &#8209;approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 trials, to confirm the effect on the desired clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post &#8209;approval trials, or the inability to confirm a clinical benefit during post &#8209;marketing trials, may allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. In addition, all promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 

Post &#8209;approval Requirements 

Any products for which we may receive future FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record &#8209;keeping requirements, reporting and analysis of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety, efficacy and quality information, product sampling and distribution requirements, maintaining up &#8209;to &#8209;date labels, warnings, and contraindications, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the approved label; products cannot be promoted for unapproved, or off &#8209;label, uses, although physicians may prescribe drugs for off &#8209;label uses in accordance with the practice of medicine. Manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to manufacturing processes often require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post &#8209;marketing programs. 

Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections for compliance with cGMP and other laws. FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at manufacturing that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct. 

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market such as adverse events the existence or severity of which was unknown when the product was approved. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or complete withdrawal from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal payments or penalties. 

From time to time, new legislation is enacted that changes the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing, and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance may be revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory or policy changes will occur or be implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 

&#160;

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch &#8209;Waxman Act. The Hatch &#8209;Waxman Act permits a patent term to be extended up to five years as compensation for patent term effectively lost due to the FDA&#8217;s pre &#8209;market approval requirements. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one &#8209;half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension. Extensions are not granted as a matter of right and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent and within a 60-day period from the date the product is first approved for commercial marketing. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. Where a product contains multiple active ingredients, if any one active ingredient has not been previously approved, it can form the basis of an extension of patent term provided the patent claims that ingredient or the combination. 

In the future, we may apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us. 

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The specific scope varies, but fundamentally the FDCA provides a five &#8209;year period of non &#8209;patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity never previously approved by FDA either alone or in combination. For a new chemical entity that was issued orphan drug designation, the FDCA provides marketing exclusivity for the &#8220;same drug&#8221; and &#8220;same indication&#8221; for a period of seven years. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non &#8209;infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability trials, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three &#8209;year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five &#8209;year and three &#8209;year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the pre &#8209;clinical trials and adequate and well &#8209;controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 

Pediatric Information and Exclusivity 

Under the FDCA, NDAs and certain supplements to NDAs must contain data adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. A sponsor must submit an initial Pediatric Trial Plan, or PSP, within 60-days of an end &#8209;of &#8209;phase 2 meeting or at certain other agreed times. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric trial or trials that the sponsor plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral or waiver, along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP, which can be amended over time. 

&#160;

The FDCA also permits certain drugs to obtain an additional six months of exclusivity (e.g., add &#8209;on to NCE or orphan drug exclusivity) and certain patent protection if the sponsor submits information in response to a written request from FDA, relating to the use of the drug in children. The FDA only issues a written request for pediatric clinical trials prior to approval of an NDA where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may produce health benefits in that population. Even if FDA makes a written request if may later determine that the studies submitted do not meet the terms of the Written Request. 

Orphan Drug Designation 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drug candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the drug for the indication can be recovered by sales of the drug in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Although there may be some increased communication opportunities, orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 

If a drug candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in very limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee. 

Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of our drug candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#8217;s product for the same indication or disease. 

As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a drug candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product. 

The FDA and foreign regulators expect holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the orphan drug. 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement 

United States 

Even if the FDA approves NDAs for our drug candidates, sales of our products will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement by third party payers, such as government health programs, commercial or private insurance, and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA &#8209;approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payer&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 

&#160;

The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 

European Union 

In Europe and many other foreign countries, the success of our drug candidates we may develop, depends largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement, because in many foreign countries patients are unlikely to use prescription pharmaceutical products that are not reimbursed by their governments. Negotiating reimbursement rates in foreign countries can delay the commercialization of a pharmaceutical product and generally results in a reimbursement rate that is lower than the net price that companies can obtain for the same product in the United States. 

In some countries, such as Germany, commercial sales of a product can begin while the reimbursement rate that a company will receive in future periods is under discussion. In other countries, a company must complete the reimbursement discussions prior to the commencement of commercial sales of the pharmaceutical product. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of drugs for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the drug or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug on the market. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries. 

Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

Pharmaceutical companies also are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti &#8209;kickback laws and false claims laws, and the reporting of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. 

Anti &#8209;kickback Laws 

U.S. federal laws, including the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute, prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including CMS, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for HHS, and various state agencies. These anti &#8209;kickback laws prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program. Remuneration is broadly defined to include anything of value, such as cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies, or equipment. The anti &#8209;kickback laws are broad and prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 

The penalties for violating the anti &#8209;kickback laws can be severe. The sanctions include criminal and civil penalties, and possible exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal anti &#8209;kickback laws, and some apply to items and services reimbursable by any payer, including third party payers. 

&#160;

Federal and State Prohibitions on False Claims 

The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment under federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he has actual knowledge of the information or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information. Although we would not submit claims directly to government payers, manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act if they are deemed to &#8220;cause&#8221; the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off &#8209;label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. 

Provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the federal government and to share in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in connection with the action. The number of filings under these provisions has increased significantly in recent years. Conduct that violates the False Claims Act may also lead to exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. In addition, various states have enacted similar laws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state healthcare programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to all payers. 

Federal Prohibitions on Healthcare Fraud and False Statements Related to Healthcare Matters 

There are numerous federal and state laws protecting the privacy and security of protected health information. Additionally, a number of related crimes can be prosecuted related to healthcare fraud, false statements relating to healthcare matters, theft or embezzlement in connection with a health benefit program, and obstruction of criminal investigation of healthcare offenses. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including a private insurer. Violation of any of these laws is a felony and may result in fines or exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. 

Physician Payment Sunshine Act 

The Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires most pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to the Secretary of HHS financial arrangements, payments, or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals. The payment information is made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website. Over the next several years, we will need to dedicate significant resources to establish and maintain systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties. Similar laws have been enacted or are under consideration in foreign jurisdictions, including France, which has adopted the Loi Bertrand , or French Sunshine Act, which became effective in 2013. 

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing, or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 

Other Regulations 

In addition to the statutes and regulations described above, we also are subject to regulation in the United States under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations, now or hereafter in effect. 

&#160;

Foreign Regulation 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials, distribution, and future commercial sales of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug candidate, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we can commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 

Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, or diabetes and optional for those medicines that are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more &#8220;concerned&#8221; member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the &#8220;reference&#8221; member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state&#8217;s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether or not to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 

Employees 

As of March 8, 2016, we had 29 full &#8209;time employees and two part &#8209;time employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
