 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Zion Oil and Gas, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an oil and gas exploration company with a history of over 15 years of oil and gas exploration in Israel. We were incorporated in Florida on April 6, 2000 and reincorporated in Delaware on July 9, 2003. We completed our initial public offering in January 2007. Our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;) currently trades on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol &#8220;ZN&#8221; and our Common Stock warrant under the symbol &#8220;ZNWAA.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Zion currently holds one active petroleum exploration license onshore Israel, the Megiddo-Jezreel License (&#8220;MJL&#8221;), comprising approximately 99,000 acres. The Company has selected the specific drill pad location from which to drill its next exploration well, which it plans to spud within the second quarter of 2016. The spudding and drilling of this well to the desired depth is subject to the Company raising sufficient funds from the current rights offering (scheduled to terminate on March 31, 2016) and possible additional capital raising efforts. 

&#160; 

Depending on the results of the planned exploratory well and having adequate cash resources, multiple wells could be drilled from this pad site as several subsurface geologic targets can be reached using directional well trajectories. 

&#160; 

At present, we have no revenues or operating income. Our ability to generate future revenues and operating cash flow will depend on the successful exploration and exploitation of our current and any future petroleum rights or the acquisition of oil and/or gas producing properties, and the volume and timing of such production. In addition, even if we are successful in producing oil and gas in commercial quantities, our results will depend upon commodity prices for oil and gas, as well as operating expenses including taxes and royalties. 

&#160; 

Our executive offices are located at 12655 North Central Expressway, Suite 1000, Dallas, Texas 75243, and our telephone number is (214) 221-4610. Our branch office&#8217;s address in Israel is 9 Halamish Street, North Industrial Park, Caesarea 3088900, and the telephone number is +972-4-623-8500. Our website address is: www.zionoil.com. 

&#160; 

Company Background 

&#160; 

In 1983, during a visit to Israel, John M. Brown (our Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors) became inspired and dedicated to finding oil and gas in Israel. During the next 17 years he made several trips each year to Israel, hired oil and gas consultants in Israel and Texas, met with Israeli government officials, made direct investments with local exploration companies, and assisted Israeli exploration companies in raising money for oil and gas exploration in Israel. This activity led Mr. Brown to form Zion Oil &#38; Gas, Inc. in April 2000, in order to receive the award of a small onshore petroleum license from the Israeli government. 

&#160; 

Zion&#8217;s vision, as guided by John Brown, of finding oil and/or natural gas in Israel, is biblically inspired. The vision is based, in part, on biblical references alluding to the presence of oil and/or natural gas in territories within the State of Israel that were formerly within certain ancient biblical tribal areas. While John Brown provides the broad vision and goals for our company, the actions taken by the Zion Board of Directors and management team as it actively explores for oil and gas in Israel, are based on modern science and good business practice. Zion&#8217;s oil and gas exploration activities are supported by appropriate geological, geophysical and other science-based studies and surveys typically carried out by companies engaged in oil and gas exploration activities. 

&#160; 

Upon the award of our first petroleum right in May 2000, the Israeli government provided us access to most of its data with respect to previous exploration in the area, including geologic reports, seismic records and profiles, drilling reports, well files, gravity surveys, geochemical surveys and regional maps. We also gathered information concerning prior and ongoing geological, geophysical and drilling activity relevant to our planned activities from a variety of publicly accessible sources. Subsequently, we have acquired additional studies on our own such as seismic and other geophysical and geological surveys. 

&#160; 

To date, the Company has drilled four exploratory wells. While the presence of hydrocarbons was indicated while drilling certain of these wells, none of the exploratory wells that we have drilled to date have been deemed capable of producing oil or gas in commercial quantities.

ZION&#8217;S CURRENT EXPLORATION LICENSE AREA 

&#160; 

Zion currently holds one active petroleum exploration license onshore Israel, the Megiddo-Jezreel License (covering an area of approximately 99,000 acres &#8211; See Map 1). Under Israeli law, Zion has an exclusive right to oil and gas exploration in our license area in that no other company may drill there. In the event we drill an oil or gas discovery in our license area, current Israeli law entitles us to convert the relevant portions of our license to a 30-year production lease, extendable to 50 years, subject to compliance with a field development work program and production. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Summary of Current and Former Company License Areas 

&#160; 

Megiddo-Jezreel Petroleum License 

&#160; 

The Megiddo-Jezreel License (&#8220;MJL&#8221;) was awarded on December 3, 2013 for a three-year primary term through December 2, 2016, with the possibility of additional one-year extensions up to a maximum of seven years. The MJL (~99,000 acres) is onshore, south and west of the Sea of Galilee. 

&#160; 

Under the original terms of this license, we had until July 1, 2015 to identify and submit a drilling prospect. The license terms also called for us to enter into a drilling contract by October 1, 2015 and begin drilling or &#8220;spud&#8221; a well by December 1, 2015. Zion applied for an extension/revision of the current MJL terms on September 3, 2015 (see below), which was subsequently approved, giving Zion until March 1, 2016 to spud a well within the MJL. Thereafter, Zion applied for a further extension/revision which was subsequently granted, giving us until July 1, 2016 to spud a well within the MJL (see below). 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In late June 2015, the Company entered into drilling contract negotiations with Viking Services, BV (&#8220;Viking&#8221;), and Viking&#8217;s Israeli subsidiary, for use of a land-based rig with deep drilling capacity and certain other oilfield services for exploration activities within Zion&#8217;s MJL. Over the last several months, Zion became aware that Viking was undergoing a restructuring whereby there would be a high-level management change and Viking&#8217;s Israel operations would very likely change. Therefore, drilling contract negotiations with Viking were temporarily suspended pending the outcome of the restructuring which to date, remains unresolved.

&#160;

In the interim, we initiated drilling contract negotiations with Lapidoth, an Israeli-based drilling services provider, and we remain currently engaged in those negotiations.

&#160;

On September 3, 2015, Zion submitted its Application for Extension of Drilling Date (Megiddo-Jezreel License No. 401) . Based on regulatory and other delays that precluded Zion from spudding the well by December 1, 2015, Zion sought an extension of Special Conditions as shown below.

&#160;

On October 13, 2015, Zion received a formal letter from Israel&#8217;s Petroleum Commissioner granting the drilling date extension request as well other work plan terms as follows:

&#160;

No. &#160; ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION &#160; TO BE CARRIED OUT BY: 1 &#160; Sign contract with drilling contractor, and provide commissioner with contractor agreement &#160; 1 December 2015 2 &#160; Submit detailed engineering plan for performing the drilling &#160; 1 December 2015 3 &#160; Spud a well within the license area &#160; 1 March 2016 4 &#160; Submit final report on drilling results &#160; 15 October 2016 5 &#160; Submit plan for continued work in license area &#160; 15 November 2016 &#160; 

On January 29, 2016, we submitted a second Application for Extension of Drilling Date , seeking additional work program date extensions/revisions. On February 7, 2016, the Petroleum Commissioner formally approved the application with minor modifications as follows: 

&#160;

NO. &#160; ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION &#160; TO BE CARRIED OUT BY: 1 &#160; Sign contract with drilling contractor and forward to Petroleum Commissioner &#160; 15 April 2016 2 &#160; Submit detailed engineering plan to carry out / perform drilling &#160; 15 April 2016 3 &#160; Begin drilling / spud well in license area &#160; 1 July 2016 4 &#160; Submit final report on the results of drilling &#160; 15 November 2016 5 &#160; Submit a plan for continued work in the license area &#160; 1 December 2016 &#160;

On January 21, 2015, Zion formally submitted its Environmental Impact Assessment (&#8220;EIA&#8221;) document for our upcoming Megiddo-Jezreel #1 well to Israel&#8217;s Ministry of National Infrastructures, Energy and Water Resources (&#8220;Energy Ministry&#8221;) and thereafter, on January 25, 2015, to the Ministry of Environmental Protection (&#8220;Environmental Ministry&#8221;). 

&#160;

On March 22, 2015, Zion formally submitted its EIA document for its planned Megiddo-Jezreel #1 well to the Northern District Committee in Nazareth. On August 23, 2015, we formally submitted to the Northern District Committee a further revised and updated EIA document, which has now been formally approved by Israel's Energy and Environmental Ministries.

&#160;

On December 21, 2015, the Northern District Committee unanimously granted approval of our Drilling Request (&#8220;Hafkada&#8221;), including the EIA. This is a critically important step to drill a well under Israel&#8217;s complex, detailed, and extensive regulatory process.

&#160;

The final step in the process is for Zion to submit this approved &#8220;Hafkada&#8221; along with our Application to Drill to Israel&#8217;s Energy Ministry for their final drilling program approval. After Zion reaches agreement with the local kibbutz and the Israel Land Authority and obtains a Business License for the drilling project, we plan to begin drill site construction (which should take 30-45 days to complete). While Zion has until July 1, 2016 to begin drilling, subject to the success of our capital raising efforts we plan to spud the Megiddo-Jezreel #1 well in May or June of 2016.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Zion&#8217;s Former Jordan Valley, Asher-Menashe and Joseph Licenses 

&#160; 

On March 29, 2015, the Energy Ministry formally approved Zion&#8217;s application to merge the southernmost portion of the Jordan Valley License into the Megiddo-Jezreel License. The Joseph License expired on October 10, 2013, after our final extension. The Asher-Menashe License expired on June 9, 2014 as its full seven year term ended. Zion has plugged all of its exploratory wells on those License areas, but acknowledges its obligation to complete the abandonment of these well sites in accordance with guidance from the Energy Ministry, Environmental Ministry and local officials. We continue to make significant progress toward fully abandoning all these sites. 

&#160; 

Exploration Plans Going Forward 

&#160; 

We continue our exploration focus on our Megiddo-Jezreel License area as that area appears to possess the key geologic ingredients of an active petroleum system. We have selected the specific drill pad location from which to drill our next exploration well, which we plan to spud in the first half of 2016. 

&#160; 

Prior to actually drilling the next exploratory well, we will need to enter into a contract with a drilling rig operator with the appropriate rig, equipment, and experienced drilling crew. As of the date of this report, Zion has not yet entered into any legally binding agreements for the use of a rig although the issue currently remains in negotiations. In the event that we decide to import a drilling rig into Israel, we will need to obtain the appropriate regulatory consents and approvals for the importation of the rig. 

&#160; 

In September 2015, Zion engaged Forrest Garb &#38; Associates (&#8220;FGA&#8221;), an international petroleum engineering and geoscience consulting firm and an independent third party, to provide a resource assessment report, as required under the terms of Zion&#8217;s current petroleum exploration license. FGA prepared its Resource Assessment Report of Gross Prospective Resources (&#8220;Garb Report)) which relates to Zion&#8217;s Beit Shean Prospect for the proposed drilling of the Megiddo-Jezreel #1 well (&#8220;MJ #1&#8221;). This independent analysis affirms Zion&#8217;s internal interpretation of four separate objectives (Mid-Cretaceous, Upper Jurassic, Mid-Jurassic and Triassic) and discloses resource estimates.

&#160; 

FGA&#8217;s estimates of prospective resource volumes used probabilistic analysis methods in accordance with the Petroleum Resources Management System (PRMS) as endorsed by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the World Petroleum Council, and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers. The classification system and definitions are in common use internationally within the petroleum industry. They provide a measure of comparability and reduce the subjective nature of resource estimation. This analysis provides a consistent approach to estimating petroleum quantities, evaluating development projects, and presenting results within a comprehensive classification framework. The Garb Report is attached as an exhibit to this annual report on Form 10-K.

&#160; 

It should be noted that &#8220;Contingent Resources&#8221; and &#8220;Prospective Resources&#8221; used in the Garb Report do not represent an estimate of reserves. Readers are cautioned that under applicable SEC rules, the disclosure of estimates of oil or gas resources other than reserves, and any estimated values of such resources, is not permitted to be disclosed in any document publicly filed with the SEC. 

&#160; 

We estimate that, in order to be commercially productive, any of the wells we eventually drill would need to be capable of producing at least 200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Such production levels will not likely pay out the cost of drilling the well, but only the costs of completing (i.e. perforating, tubing and installing field facilities) and operating the well. In order to justify the costs of drilling additional wells, there would need to be the expectation that each additional well would have initial production rates of approximately 800 barrels of oil equivalent per day, based upon minimum oil prices of about $30.00 per barrel.

Exploration Expenditures 

&#160; 

The following table summarizes the amounts we expended on our exploration efforts during 2015 and 2014: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; &#160; US$ (000) &#160; &#160; US$ (000) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Megiddo-Jezreel Valley License &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Geological &#38; Geophysical Operations &#160; &#160; 725 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,430 &#160; Equipment purchasing &#160; &#160; 443 &#160; &#160; &#160; -- &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Asher-Menashe License (expired on June 9, 2014) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Geological &#38; Geophysical Operations &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; &#160; &#160; 935 &#160; Plug &#38; Abandonment Operations &#160; &#160; 178 &#160; &#160; &#160; 172 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Jordan Valley License (expired on April 12, 2014) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Geological &#38; Geophysical Operations &#160; &#160; -- &#160; &#160; &#160; 17 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Joseph License (expired on October 10, 2013) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Plug &#38; Abandonment Operations &#160; &#160; 77 &#160; &#160; &#160; 169 &#160; Geological &#38; Geophysical Operations &#160; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; &#160; 1,438 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,723 &#160; &#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 21 employees of whom all but two are on a full time basis. Of these employees, 11 work out of our Dallas office and 10 work out of the Caesarea, Israel office. None of our current employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and there have been no strikes. We regularly utilize independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services, particularly for services connected to drilling operations, such as specialized engineering, logging, cementing and well-testing.

&#160; 

Competition and Markets 

&#160; 

The oil and gas exploration industry in Israel currently consists of a number of exploration companies. These include relatively small local or foreign companies (such as Zion Oil &#38; Gas, Genie Oil &#38; Gas/Afek, and Givot Olam) with limited financial resources, as well as consortia of local Israeli and foreign participants (Noble Energy Inc./Delek Group Ltd.) with substantial financial resources. Most groups are engaged primarily in offshore activities, which is not an area in which we are currently active. So long as we hold our current license, Israeli law conveys an exclusive exploration right to Zion such that no additional companies may compete in our license area. 

&#160; 

Historically, primarily for geopolitical reasons, Israel (particularly onshore) has not been an area of interest for international integrated or large or mid-size independent oil and gas exploration companies. Since the announcement of the Tamar and Leviathan discoveries, this situation has changed somewhat. However, given the current limited availability in Israel of oil field service companies, equipment and personnel, in periods of increased exploration interest and activity, there is competition for available equipment and services. In this market Zion has no particular advantage. We attempt to enhance our position by developing and maintaining good professional relations with oil field service providers and by demonstrating a high level of credibility in making and meeting commercial commitments. 

&#160; 

The oil and gas industry is cyclical, and from time to time there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies are substantially greater. If the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel were particularly severe in the areas where we operate, we could be materially and adversely affected. We believe that there are potential alternative providers of drilling services and that it may be necessary to establish relationships with new contractors as our activity level and capital program grows. However, there can be no assurance that we can establish such relationships or that those relationships will result in increased availability of drilling rigs. 

&#160; 

If any of our exploratory wells are commercially productive, we would install the appropriate production equipment which includes among other items oil and gas separation facilities and storage tanks. Under the terms of the Petroleum Law, we may be required by the Minister of Energy and Water Resources to offer first refusal for any oil and gas discovered to Israeli domestic purchasers at market prices. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Since Israel imports almost all of its crude oil needs and the market for crude oil in Israel is limited to two local oil refineries, no special marketing strategy need be adopted initially with regard to any oil that we may ultimately discover. We believe that we would have a ready local market for our oil at market prices and would have the option of exporting to the international market, if any of our future exploratory wells are commercially productive. 

&#160; 

Israel&#8217;s Petroleum Law 

&#160; 

Our business in Israel is subject to regulation by the State of Israel under the Petroleum Law. The administration and implementation of the Petroleum Law are vested in the Minister of Energy and Water Resources, the Petroleum Commissioner and an advisory council. The following discussion includes a brief summary review of certain provisions of the Petroleum Law as currently in effect. This review is not complete, and it should not be relied on as a definitive restatement of the law related to petroleum exploration and production activities in Israel. 

&#160; 

Petroleum resources are owned by the State of Israel, regardless of whether they are located on state lands or the offshore continental shelf. No person is allowed to explore for or produce petroleum without being granted a specific right under the Petroleum Law. 

&#160; 

License. The &#8220;license&#8221; is a petroleum exploration right, bestowing an exclusive right for further exploration work and requiring the drilling of one or more test wells. The initial term of a license is up to three years and it may be extended for up to an additional four years (in one year increments). A license area may not exceed 400,000 dunams (approximately 98,842 acres). One dunam is equal to 1,000 square meters (approximately 0.24711 of an acre). No one entity may hold more than 12 licenses or hold more than a total of four million dunam in aggregate license area. 

&#160; 

Production lease. Upon discovery of petroleum in commercial quantities, a licensee has a statutory &#8220;right&#8221; to receive a production &#8220;lease.&#8221; The initial lease term is 30 years, extendable for an additional 20 years (up to a maximum period of 50 years). A lease confers upon the lessee the exclusive right to explore for and produce petroleum in the lease area and requires the lessee to produce petroleum in commercial quantities (or pursue test or development drilling). The lessee is entitled to transport and market the petroleum produced, subject, however, to the right of the government to require the lessee to supply local needs first, at market price. 

&#160; 

Petroleum rights fees. The holders of licenses and leases are required to pay fees to the government of Israel to maintain the rights. The fees vary according to the nature of the right, the size and location (onshore or offshore) of the right, acreage subject to the right and, in the case of a license, the period during which the license has been maintained. For a license, the two initial years fees and third year fees are approximately New Israeli Shekels (NIS) 110, and (NIS) 183, respectively (approximately US $28 and US $47 at the Bank of Israel representative rate published on December 31, 2015) per thousand dunams (approx. 247.11 acres) per year. Every subsequent year, the license fee increases incrementally. 

&#160; 

Requirements and entitlements of holders of petroleum rights. The holder of a petroleum right (license or lease) is required to conduct its operations in accordance with a work program set as part of the petroleum right, with due diligence and in accordance with the accepted practice in the petroleum industry. The holder is required to submit progress and final reports; provided, however, the information disclosed in such reports remains confidential for as long as the holder owns a petroleum right on the area concerned. 

&#160; 

If the holder of a petroleum right does not comply with the work program provided by the terms of the right, the Petroleum Commissioner may issue a notice requiring that the holder cure the default within 60 days of the giving of the notice, together with a warning that failure to comply within the 60-day cure period may entail cancellation of the right. If the petroleum right is cancelled following such notice, the holder of the right may, within 30 days of the date of notice of the Commissioner&#8217;s decision, appeal such cancellation to the Minister of Energy and Water Resources. No petroleum right shall be cancelled until the Minister of Energy and Water Resources has ruled on the appeal. 

&#160; 

We are obligated, according to the Petroleum Law, to pay royalties to the Government of Israel on the gross production of oil and gas from the oil and gas properties of Zion located in Israel (excluding those reserves serving to operate the wells and related equipment and facilities). The royalty rate stated in the Petroleum Law is 12.5% of the produced reserves. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company did not have any outstanding obligation with respect to royalty payments, since it is in the development stage and, to this date, no proved reserves have been found. 

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In March 2011, the Israeli parliament enacted the Petroleum Profits Taxation Law, 2011, which imposes a new levy on oil and gas production. Under the new tax regime, the Israeli Government repealed the percentage depletion deduction and imposed a levy at an initial rate of 20% on profits from oil and gas which will gradually rise to 45.52% for 2016 onwards, depending on the levy coefficient (the R-Factor). The R-Factor refers to the percentage of the amount invested in the exploration, the development and the establishment of the project, so that the 20% rate will be imposed only after a recovery of 150% of the amount invested (R-Factor of 1.5) and will range linearly up to 45.52% after a recovery of 230% of the amount invested (R-Factor of 2.3). For purposes of the levy rate calculation, the minimal gas sale price that will be accepted by the State is the bi-annual average local price. The present 12.5% royalty imposed on oil revenues remains unchanged. 

&#160; 

The grant of a petroleum right does not automatically entitle its holder to enter upon the land to which the right applies or to carry out exploration and production work thereon. Entry requires the consent of the private or public holders of the surface rights and of other public regulatory bodies (e.g. planning and building authorities, Nature Reserves Authority, municipal and security authorities, etc.). The holder of a petroleum right may request the government to acquire, on its behalf, land needed for petroleum purposes. The petroleum right holder is required to obtain all other necessary approvals. 

&#160; 

Petroleum Taxation. Our activities in Israel will be subject to taxation both in Israel and in the United States. Under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, we will be entitled to claim either a deduction or a foreign tax credit with respect to Israeli income taxes paid or incurred on our Israeli source oil and gas income. As a general rule, we anticipate that it will be more advantageous for us to claim a credit rather than a deduction for applicable Israeli income taxes on our U.S tax return. A tax treaty exists between the U.S. and Israel that would provide opportunity to use the tax credit. 

&#160; 

Exploration and development expenses. Under current US and Israeli tax laws, exploration and development expenses incurred by a holder of a petroleum right can, at the option of such holder, either be expensed in the year incurred or capitalized and expensed (or amortized) over a period of years. Most of our expenses to date have been expensed for both U.S. and Israeli income tax purposes. 

&#160; 

Depletion allowances. Until 2011, the holder of an interest in a petroleum license or lease was allowed a deduction for income tax purposes on account of the depletion of the petroleum reserve relating to such interest. This may have been by way of percentage depletion or cost depletion, whichever is greater. In 2010, the Finance Minister of Israel established an advisory committee to study the country&#8217;s fiscal policy as it relates to the upstream oil and natural gas sector, as well as various options, including an increase in royalties or cancellation of tax incentives. In January 2011, the Finance Ministry advisory committee issued its final recommendations which included cancellation of currently existing tax incentives, including the depletion allowance. In 2011, the depletion allowance was abolished. 

&#160; 

Corporate tax. Under current Israeli tax laws, whether a company is registered in Israel or is a foreign company operating in Israel through a branch, it is subject to Israeli Companies Tax on its taxable income (including capital gains) from Israeli sources at a flat rate of 25%, effective January 1, 2016. 

&#160; 

Import duties. Insofar as similar items are not available in Israel, the Petroleum Law provides that the owner of a petroleum right may import into Israel, free of most customs, purchase taxes and other import duties, all machinery, equipment, installations, fuel, structures, transport facilities, etc. (apart from consumer goods and private cars and similar vehicles) that are required for the petroleum exploration and production purposes, subject to the requirement that security be provided to ensure that the equipment is exported out of Israel within the agreed upon time frame. 

&#160; 

Israeli Energy Related Regulations 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to legal and regulatory oversight by energy-related ministries or other agencies of Israel, each having jurisdiction over certain relevant energy or hydrocarbons laws.

&#160;

&#160; 

The Onshore Petroleum Exploration Permitting Process in Israel 

&#160; 

The permitting process in Israel with respect to petroleum exploration continues to undergo significant modification, the result of which is to considerably increase the complexity, time period, and expenditures needed to obtain the necessary permits to undertake exploratory drilling once a drilling prospect has been identified. Applications for new exploration licenses need to comply with more demanding requirements relating to a license applicant&#8217;s financial capability, experience and access to experienced personnel. 

&#160; 

In July 2013, the Environmental Ministry published: &#8220;Environmental Guidelines for the preparation of an environmental document supplementary to a license for searching &#8211; experimental drilling and land extraction tests.&#8221; This document extensively details the requirements for a supplemental environmental document to an oil and gas exploration plan. On January 21, 2015, Zion formally submitted its Environmental Impact Assessment (&#8220;EIA&#8221;) document for our upcoming Megiddo-Jezreel #1 well to Israel&#8217;s Energy Ministry and thereafter, on January 25, 2015, to the Environmental Ministry. This key milestone is required by the MJL work plan as well as by Israeli law and regulations. 

&#160; 

On December 3, 2013, the State of Israel&#8217;s Petroleum Commissioner awarded Zion the Megiddo-Jezreel Petroleum Exploration License No. 401. Subsequently, we secured a bank guarantee in the amount of $930,000 from an Israeli based bank in accordance with the performance guarantee guidelines. Consequently, Zion believes it has met the requirements of the June 2012 onshore exploratory licensing guidelines and the October 2012 performance guarantee guidelines. 

&#160; 

On January 21, 2014, the Energy Ministry issued safety guidelines regarding holders of rights under the Petroleum Law that also relate to oil and gas drilling and production activities. Included in the safety guidelines is the duty to appoint a safety supervisor and prepare a safety plan.

&#160; 

On February 6, 2014, the Energy Ministry issued proposed guidelines for bank guarantees and insurance requirements with respect to oil and gas rights. Under these guidelines, applicants for and existing holders of exploration rights are required to submit certain bank guarantees and insurance policies that were not previously required. 

&#160; 

On September 17, 2014, the proposed guidelines became effective, and the Energy Ministry issued a guidance document entitled &#8220;Instructions for the Giving of Guarantees with respect to Oil Rights.&#8221; As it relates to existing onshore license holders like Zion, the above referenced instructions required us to obtain a new Base Bank Guarantee in the amount of $500,000 per each existing license area, split into two deposit dates as follows: (1) $250,000 by November 30, 2014 and (2) $250,000 by March 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, prior to the start of drilling, an additional bank guarantee of $250,000 will be required at least 14 days before the spud date. In summary, this is a potential cumulative total of $750,000 that is separate and apart from Zion&#8217;s existing Bank Guarantees discussed below in Liquidity and Capital Resources section. The Petroleum Commissioner has discretion to raise or lower those amounts or may also forfeit a company&#8217;s existing guarantee and/or cancel a petroleum right under certain circumstances. In addition, new and extended insurance policy guidelines were added. The Petroleum Commissioner may also view non-compliance with the new insurance provisions as breaching the work plan and the rights granted and act accordingly. 

&#160; 

Due to the Petroleum Commissioner's discretion in the matter, as of December 31, 2015, Zion has not provided the additional bank guarantees based on the September 2014 guidelines, as it has not had a specific request for same from the Commissioner. In addition, the Commissioner has discretion to raise or lower those amounts or may also forfeit a company's existing guarantee and/or cancel a petroleum right under certain circumstances. 

&#160; 

On January 11, 2015 the Energy Ministry issued revised guidelines (initially issued in February 2012) for onshore wellbore abandonment that are based on US regulations on well abandonment found in 43 CFR, Section 3162.3-4; applicable Texas Railroad Commission guidelines; and Well Abandonment and Inactive Well Practices for U.S. Exploration and Production Operations found in API Bulletin E3. This guideline is effective April 1, 2015. 

&#160; 

On February 12, 2015, the Energy Ministry issued guidance for preparation and submission of the drilling program (first presented on April 29, 2014), describing types of and purposes of production tests depending on the stage of development of a reservoir. This guideline is effective April 1, 2015. 

&#160; 

On April 27, 2015, the Energy Ministry issued guidelines for well testing, establishing procedures and minimum requirements for pressure testing, production flow testing, fluid analyses testing, etc. 

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

On August 13, 2015, the Energy Ministry issued a new guideline for hydraulic fracturing design and operations that are based on Canadian regulations per Directive 083. This guideline is effective November 21, 2015. The procedures seek to prevent impacts on water wells, non-saline aquifers and prevent surface impacts. 

&#160; 

On September 9, 2015, the Energy Ministry issued information relating to application forms for exploration drilling, detailing certain operator requirements prior to drilling, including required submission of an Application for Permit to Drill (APD) and Supplemental APD Information Sheet - Casing Design, both due 30 days prior to commencement of work. An Application for Permit to Modify (APM) form is now provided relating to changes to and modifications of already-approved drilling programs and other actions that were omitted from the original application such as production testing, abandonment, etc. An End of Operation Report (EOR) form is also provided to report the end of drilling or a temporary or a final end of operations. 

&#160; 

On December 31, 2015, the Energy Ministry issued a new guidance for wellsite design and spacing for onshore and offshore sites. The guidelines relate to the necessary safety distance between installations and equipment at the drill site, flare pit and flare design and design of the drill site. 

&#160; 

On December 31, 2015, the Energy Ministry issued revised guidance for &#8220;Transfer or Lien of Oil Rights&#8221; section 76 of the Petroleum Law. The guidelines apply to the transfer of petroleum and related rights, license and production lease as well as rights to profit and royalties. The guidelines specify transfer of control in a corporation and the necessary procedure to apply and receive approval from the Petroleum Commissioner for transfer of petroleum rights. 

&#160; 

We believe that these new regulations will significantly increase the expenditures associated with obtaining new exploration rights and drilling new wells, coupled with the heavy financial burden of &#8220;locking away&#8221; significant amounts of cash that could otherwise be used for operational purposes. Finally, this will also considerably increase the time needed to obtain all of the necessary authorizations and approvals prior to drilling. 

&#160; 

Environmental/Safety 

&#160; 

Oil and gas drilling operations could potentially harm the environment if there are polluting spills caused by the loss of well control. The Petroleum Law and regulations provide that the conduct of petroleum exploration and drilling operations be pursued in compliance with &#8220;good oil field practices&#8221; and that measures of due care be taken to avoid seepage of oil, gas and well fluids into the ground and from one geologic formation to another. The Petroleum Law and regulations also require that, upon the abandonment of a well, it be adequately plugged and marked. Recently, as a condition for issuing the required permit for the construction of a drilling site, the planning commissions have required the submission of a site remediation plan, subject to approval of the environmental authorities. The costs of future restoration and remediation can be estimated as the restoration and remediation are typical for the industry and part of &#8220;oil field best practices&#8221;. At this time, we anticipate that the future cost of the environmental requirements, site remediation and plugging will not be greater than approximately $220,000 per well drilled on our existing license areas. Our operations are also subject to claims for personal injury and property damage caused by the release of chemicals or petroleum substances by us or others in connection with the conduct of petroleum operations on our behalf. 

&#160; 

In March 2011, the Ministry of Environmental Protection issued initial guidelines relating to oil and gas drilling. This is the first time that the Ministry published specific environmental guidelines for oil and gas drilling operations, relating to onshore and offshore Israel. 

&#160; 

The guidelines are detailed and provide environmental guidance for all aspects of drilling operations, from the date an application for a license is filed and continuing through license, drilling exploration, production lease, petroleum production and abandonment of the well. The guidelines address details that must be submitted regarding the drill site, surrounding area, the actual drilling operations, the storage and removal of waste and the closing or abandoning of a well. Following meetings between the Ministry and industry representatives in 2011, the Ministry indicated that certain of their initial published guidelines will be revised. 

&#160; 

In August 2011, the Government of Israel proposed a draft law entitled &#8220;Prevention of Land Contamination and Remediation of Contaminated Land&#8221;. For the draft law to become law, the Israeli Parliament must approve it after a second and third hearing. If ultimately adopted, this proposed law would require persons engaged in activities involving &#8220;polluted materials&#8221; (defined to include petroleum crude oil or any other materials defined as such by the commissioner) including their production, treatment, handling, storage and transportation, that may affect land or water resources to prepare environmental impact statements and remediation plans either prior to commencing activities or following the occurrence of an event that may cause pollution to land or water resources or endanger public health. Under the proposal, persons responsible for violation of the law, directly or indirectly, will be liable for the clean-up costs and such violation may result in criminal sanctions. The draft law has now been re-introduced to the public in a substantially modified form with newly revised guidelines, including provisions concerning the establishment of a historical survey prior to restoration and/or reclamation of land. Until such time that the draft law relating to Prevention of Land Contamination and Remediation of Contaminated Land is enacted, the Environmental Ministry has formulated several policy papers regarding contamination and remediation of contaminated land. On January 21, 2016 the Environmental Ministry published Professional Guidelines and Standards for Remediation of Land. The guidelines clarify and define what is considered polluted land, remediation and the permitted methods to attend to polluted land and applies to oil and gas exploration companies including Zion.

&#160;

In April 2012, the &#8220;Environmental Protection Law (Emissions and Transfers to the Environment) Reporting Requirements and Register 2012&#8221; became effective. This statute imposes reporting obligations on entities engaged in oil and gas exploration activities (amongst others) in Israel relating to quantities of pollutants emitted into the air, water, land and sea (on an annual basis) and the off-site transfer of waste generated in the facility for treatment. The annual report that is to be furnished does not apply to the Company&#8217;s operations until we establish oil and/or gas production. 

&#160; 

In July 2013, the Environmental Ministry published: &#8220;Environmental Guidelines for the preparation of an environmental document supplementary to a license for searching &#8211; experimental drilling and land extraction tests.&#8221; This document extensively details the requirements for a supplemental environmental document to an oil and gas exploration plan. 

&#160; 

In January 2015, new guidelines were published regarding the abandonment of onshore (land-based) wells, as stated in Article 21 of Israel&#8217;s Petroleum Regulations 5713 -1521. The guidelines are at least partially based on certain U.S. regulations, including Texas Railroad Commission regulations required in Texas. The guidelines include, among other matters, standards for plugging wells, temporary and permanent abandonment, reclamation, restoration, etc. 

&#160; 

We do not know and cannot predict whether any new legislation in this area will be enacted and, if so, in what form and which of its provisions, if any, will relate to and affect our activities, how and to what extent or what impact, if any, it might have on our financial statements. There are no known proceedings instituted by governmental authorities, pending or known to be contemplated against us under any environmental laws. We are not aware of any events of noncompliance in our operations in connection with any environmental laws or regulations. However, we cannot predict whether any new or amended environmental laws or regulations introduced in the future will have a material adverse effect on our future business. 

&#160; 

The Company believes that these new and/or revised regulations will significantly increase the complexity, time, and expenditures associated with obtaining new exploration rights, drilling, and plugging/abandoning new wells, coupled with the heavy financial burden of &#8220;locking away&#8221; significant amounts of cash that could otherwise be used for operational purposes. 

&#160; 

Proposed Fuel Market Law Legislation 

&#160; 

In March 2012, the Energy Ministry presented a draft law entitled &#8220;Fuel Market Law.&#8221; Under the proposal as currently drafted, the following activities among others as they relate to crude oil and its products would require licenses by the Director of the Fuel Authority in the Energy Ministry: import, export, refining, storage, dispensing and loading, transport, marketing and sale. Further under the proposal a condition for the receipt of a license is that the licensee be a corporation incorporated under the Israeli Companies Law. As currently drafted, the proposal does not provide for exceptions for entities holding petroleum rights under the Petroleum Law; however, it is not certain that, even if enacted as currently proposed, the provisions of the proposed law would supersede the provisions of the Petroleum Law. We submitted comments to the Ministry with the aim of clarifying that any law to be presented for enactment clarify that the rights of holders of licenses and leases granted under the Petroleum Law will not be compromised. In July 2012 the Israeli Parliament approved at the first hearing the draft Fuel Market Law. 

&#160; 

We do not know and cannot predict the results of any attempt to enact the proposed Fuel Market Law, as currently drafted or as may be amended or, if enacted, the effect of such law on our rights under the Petroleum Law or the results of any legal challenge to the law by a holder of a license or lease issued under the Petroleum Law. 

&#160; 

Planning &#38; Building 

&#160; 

On April 24, 2012, new regulations entitled &#8220;The Petroleum Regulations (Authorization to Deviate from the Provisions of the Planning and Building Law) 5772-2012&#8221; were adopted and detail a new permitting process. 

&#160; 

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Among other things, the new regulations require the submission, to the local regulatory and permitting authorities, of a detailed environmental report relating to the proposed drilling site and surroundings. The report is to address, in detail, the environmental implications of the drilling, including hydrological analysis, surface water management, risk assessment, environmental impact, and abandonment and remediation of the drill site, among others. 

&#160; 

The drilling application must be published, and there are specified time frames (approximately 100 days) for any person (including environmental and other interested bodies) to comment on the drilling application. As a result, we believe that the time periods to obtain the necessary permits (prior to spudding a well) have been considerably increased. Currently, we are unable to accurately assess the time period that we would require to obtain the necessary permits to allow us to spud our next exploratory well. 

&#160; 

Political Climate 

&#160; 

We are directly influenced by the political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel. Specifically, we could be adversely affected by: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; any major hostilities involving Israel; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; a full or partial mobilization of the reserve forces of the Israeli army; and &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel. &#160; 

Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and a state of hostility, varying from time to time in intensity and degree, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. During 2014, for about two months from early July to August 2014, Israel launched a military operation named Operation Protective Edge in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. Over the course of the two months there were several thousand Palestinian rocket attacks for which the Israel Defense Forces responded with military action aimed primarily in the Gaza Strip. Military operations resulted in over 30 tunnels that extended from the Gaza Strip into Israel being destroyed. While a ceasefire is currently in effect, some level of conflict should be anticipated in the future. These developments have further strained relations between Israel and the Palestinians. Any ongoing or future violence between Israel and the Palestinians, armed conflicts, terrorist activities, tension along Israel&#8217;s northern borders, or political instability in the region would likely disrupt international trading activities in Israel and may materially and negatively affect our business conditions and could harm our prospects and business.

&#160; 

In addition, civil unrest, often accompanied by violence associated with the so-called &#8220;Arab Spring&#8221; has spread throughout the region over the last several years in areas such as Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. Protestors have demanded economic and political reforms, and to date, there have been several regime changes. Civil unrest could continue to spread throughout the region or grow in intensity, leading to more regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the United States and Israel, civil wars, or regional conflict. International tensions over Iran continue to exist regarding their possible development of nuclear weapons. Certain countries have considered actions ranging from economic sanctions to pre-emptive strikes on suspected nuclear sites, and Iranian officials have threatened retaliation by, among other actions, closing the Strait of Hormuz, through which a significant portion of the global crude oil supply is transported. There is also concern in Israel that the internal conflict in Syria and Lebanon, with which Israel shares borders, may spill over into Israel, coupled with the new ISIS terror organization that operates from Syria. 

&#160; 

In the fall of 2015, Russia initiated significant and direct military intervention in Syria consisting of air strikes against ISIS. With ongoing operations by Russia, the U.S. and other countries, there is an increased risk of deliberate and/or inadvertent mishaps that could give rise to grave military and political consequences. 

&#160; 

We cannot predict the effect, if any, on our business of renewed hostilities between Israel and its neighbors or any other changes in the political climate in the area.

Foundations 

&#160; 

If we are successful in finding commercial quantities of hydrocarbons in Israel, 6% of our gross revenues from production will go to fund two charitable foundations that we established with the purpose of donating to charities in Israel, the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. 

&#160; 

For charitable activities concerning Israel, the Bnei Joseph Foundation (R.A.) was established. On November 11, 2008, both the Articles of Association and Incorporation Certificate were certified by the Registrar of Amutot (i.e. Charitable Foundations) in Israel. 

&#160; 

For the U.S. and worldwide charitable activities, the Abraham Foundation - in Geneva, Switzerland was established. On June 20, 2008, the Articles of Incorporation were executed and filed by the Swiss Notary in the Commercial Registrar in Geneva. On June 23, 2008, the initial organizational meeting of the founding members was convened in Israel. Regulations for the Organization of the Abraham Foundation, signed by the founding members, were then filed with the Registrar. On November 19, 2008, the Swiss Confederation approved the Foundation as an international foundation under the supervision of the federal government. On December 8, 2008, the Republic of Geneva and the Federal government of Switzerland issued a tax ruling providing complete tax exemption for the Foundation. 

&#160; 

Our shareholders, in a resolution passed at the 2002 Annual Meeting, gave authority to the Zion Board of Directors to transfer a 3% overriding royalty interest to each of the two foundations with regard to the Joseph and Asher-Menashe licenses. In accordance with that resolution, we took steps to legally donate a 3% overriding royalty interest to the Bnei Joseph Foundation (in Israel) and a 3% overriding royalty interest to the Abraham Foundation (in Switzerland). 

&#160; 

On June 22, 2009, we received an official letter from the Commissioner informing us that the 3% overriding royalty interest to each of the Bnei Joseph Foundation and the Abraham Foundation had been registered in the Israeli Oil Register with regard to the Joseph and Asher-Menashe licenses. On November 9, 2011, we received an official letter from the Commissioner informing us that the 3% overriding royalty interest to each of the Bnei Joseph Foundation and the Abraham Foundation had been registered in the Israeli Oil Register with regard to the Jordan Valley License. 

&#160; 

On February 5, 2014, the Company submitted applications to the Petroleum Commissioner, requesting royalty interest transfers from the Megiddo-Jezreel License of 3% overriding royalties to the Bnei Joseph Amutot and the Abraham Foundation, respectively. On April 8, 2014, the transfers were approved by the Petroleum Commissioner and duly registered.
