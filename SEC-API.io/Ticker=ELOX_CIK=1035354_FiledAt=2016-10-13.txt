 Item 1. Business. &#160; 

Our Business 

&#160;

On September 29, 2014, we changed our name from Senesco Technologies, Inc. to Sevion Therapeutics, Inc.

&#160;

The primary business of Sevion Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Senesco, Inc., a New Jersey corporation incorporated in 1998, and Fabrus, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2011, collectively referred to as &#8220;Sevion,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our,&#8221; is to build and develop a portfolio of innovative therapeutics, from both internal discovery and acquisition, for the treatment of cancer and immunological diseases. The Company&#8217;s product candidates are derived from multiple key proprietary technology platforms, such as: cell-based arrayed antibody discovery, ultralong antibody scaffolds and Chimerasome nanocages.

&#160;

Antibody Technology 

&#160; 

Antibody Genes - We believe our antibody platforms have broad applicability to human health by allowing the discovery of unique monoclonal antibodies against difficult membrane targets in several therapeutic areas. Our antibody therapeutic candidates target the Kv1.3 ion channel, which is important in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Other antibodies in our pipeline target important cell surface molecules involved in cancer progression.

&#160; 

Antibody Discovery Technology - Traditional antibody drug discovery methods, such as phage/yeast display or immunization, rely on competitive selection from a pool of antibodies to identify a lead therapeutic candidate. In these methods, a mixture of antibodies compete for binding to a purified target, and the antibody molecules that bind the strongest to the target, referred to as high affinity, are ultimately discovered. While these approaches have led to many successful antibody therapeutics, there are at least two drawbacks. First, the drug targets have been limited to only those proteins which can be easily purified. Many important target classes, including multispanning membrane proteins, cannot be easily purified in functional form. Secondly, when discovery is driven by selection based on competitive binding and affinity, the result is a significant limitation in the number of functional lead antibodies. However, the highest affinity antibody isn&#8217;t always the best therapeutic because lower affinity molecules may have unique activities or lower toxicities than the highest affinity binder. Thus, modulating a pathway more subtly to treat disease is often preferable to affecting it in a binary fashion through competition related to high-affinity binding. We believe the technology to identify (i) antibodies against unpurified targets, particularly multispanning membrane proteins like G Protein Coupled Receptors, or GPCR&#8217;s, and ion channels, and (ii) a range of antibodies with different affinities and activities will enable us to discover new antibody drug leads compared to existing technologies.

&#160;

We have developed the world&#8217;s first &#8220;spatially addressed&#8221; antibody library with an expansive combinatorial collection of recombinant antibodies in which each well contains a single species of antibody of known concentration, composition and sequence. Our spatially addressed library allows us to evaluate the therapeutic potential of each antibody individually in a non-competitive way and allows direct discovery on the cell surface. This approach is more analogous to traditional small molecule drug discovery and allows us to screen antibodies for functional drug activity as opposed to simple binding properties. This next generation discovery system unlocks epitopes, targets, and functions that are only identifiable in the context of a living cell.

&#160;

&#160; 

Modified Cow Antibodies - Despite the enormous diversity of the antibody repertoire, human antibodies all have a similar geometry, shape and binding mode. Our scientists have discovered and humanized a novel class of therapeutic antibodies derived from cows that have a highly unusual structure for binding targets. This unique ultralong Complementary Determining Region 3, or CDR3, structural domain found in cow antibodies is comprised of a knob on a stalk that protrudes far from the antibody surface, creating the potential for entirely new types of therapeutic functionality. Using both our humanized spatially addressed antibody library and direct engineering of the knob, we are exploring the ability of utilizing the knob and stalk structure to functionally interact with important therapeutic targets, including GPCRs, ion channels and other multispanning membrane therapeutic targets on the cell surface. Our lead antibody, SVN001, was derived from these efforts.

&#160; 

Antibody Drug Candidates &#8211; We have created functional antibodies that modulate GPCRs and ion channels, two classes of targets that have proven difficult to address using conventional antibody discovery approaches.

&#160; 

SVN001 is an ion channel blocking antibody that is potentially the first therapeutic antibody against this target class. SVN001 targets an ion channel, Kv1.3, which has been implicated in a number of different autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. By targeting a unique subset of immune cells, SVN001 is not believed to be broadly immunosuppressive, therefore potentially improving the safety profile compared to typical immunosuppressants.

&#160; 

SVN002 is a unique antibody against an oncology target that holds the potential to significantly impact highly metastatic tumors that are resistant to the class of drugs that target vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. The target is highly expressed in clear cell renal carcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis.

&#160; 

Other Antibodies 

&#160; 

We have discovered fully human antibodies against additional oncology targets, including ErbB2, ErbB3, CXCR4, and GLP1R which have been engineered to have activity in in vitro systems. These cell surface proteins are validated, therapeutically high value targets in the disease fields of oncology and diabetes. Additionally, we have early stage antibodies against other undisclosed targets which were derived from our addressed library platform.

&#160;

Research Program 

&#160;

We were advancing SVN001 through preclinical development where it has demonstrated potent activity as well as advancing SVN002 through preclinical development. However, given the Company&#8217;s limited capital resources, in December 2014, we decided to temporarily reduce our research and development spending on our antibody program until we are able to consummate a strategic transaction or a financing transaction.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On December 18, 2014, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with CNA Development, LLC, an affiliate of Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Janssen, to discover antibodies using our spatially addressed library platform. The collaboration, facilitated by the Johnson &#38; Johnson Innovation Center in California, included discovery of antibodies against multiple targets in several therapeutic areas. We and Janssen jointly conducted research on antibodies discovered by us, and Janssen has an option to an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize candidates which resulted from the collaboration. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an up-front payment and research support payments for activities conducted in collaboration with Janssen. The research activities concluded in the third quarter of 2016 and the final report was transferred to Janssen. For candidates licensed by Janssen, we would be eligible to receive payments upon the achievement of certain development and commercial milestones potentially totaling up to $125 million as well as low single digit royalties on product sales.

&#160;

In order to pursue the above research initiatives, as well as other research initiatives that may arise, we will use our cash reserves. However, it will be necessary for us to raise a significant amount of additional working capital in the future. If we are unable to raise the necessary funds, we may be required to significantly curtail the future development of some or all of our research initiatives and we will be unable to pursue other possible research initiatives.

&#160;

We may further expand our research and development program beyond the initiatives listed above to include other diseases and research centers.

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We continue to develop our intellectual property internally and by in-licensing certain intellectual property related to our antibody platforms and our chimerasome technology. 

&#160;

Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, certain patent related costs were capitalized. We concluded, based on historical write offs of patent cost, that the estimate of future beneficial value of our patent assets was uncertain. Due to this uncertainty, we determined it was necessary to amend the Company&#8217;s accounting policy for patent costs. This change is considered a change in estimate for accounting purposes and is reflected on a prospective basis beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Our ongoing preclinical research with cell lines and lab animal models of human disease is not currently subject to the FDA requirements that govern clinical trials. Generally, the FDA must approve any drug or biologic product before it can be marketed in the United States. In addition, prior to being sold outside of the United States, any product candidates must be approved by the regulatory agencies of foreign governments. Prior to filing a new drug application or biologics license application with the FDA, we would have to perform extensive clinical trials, and prior to beginning any clinical trial, we need to perform extensive preclinical testing which could take several years and may require substantial expenditures.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

We have five (5) employees, three (3) of whom are executive officers and who are involved in our management and we also have four (4) consultants.

&#160;

We may contract research to university laboratories or to other companies in order to advance the development of our technology.
