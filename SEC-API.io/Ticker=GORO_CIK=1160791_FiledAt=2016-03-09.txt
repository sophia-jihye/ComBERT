 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

History and Organization 

&#160; 

Gold Resource Corporation was organized under the laws of the State of Colorado on August 24, 1998. We are a producer of metal concentrates that contain gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc, and dor&#233; containing gold and silver at the Aguila Project in the southern state of Oaxaca, Mexico (&#8220;Oaxaca&#8221;). The Aguila Project includes the Aguila open pit mine, which ceased operations in February 2011, and the Arista underground mine, which is currently in operation. We also perform exploration and evaluation work on our portfolio of precious and base metal exploration properties in Oaxaca and Nevada, United States of America (&#8220;Nevada&#8221;) and continue to evaluate other properties for possible acquisition. 

&#160; 

In this report, &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;our , &#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8221; refer to Gold Resource Corporation together with our subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. 

&#160; 

We have two units in North America, the Oaxaca Mining Unit and the Nevada Mining Unit. The majority of our assets are located at our Oaxaca Mining Unit, located on our Aguila Project, including our Aguila milling facility and Arista underground mine. The Aguila milling facility produces metal concentrates and dor&#233; from ore mined from the Arista mine, which contains precious metal products of gold and silver, and by-products of copper, lead and zinc. We perform exploration and evaluation work on our properties within our Nevada Mining Unit. 

&#160; 

We commenced mining and milling operations at the Aguila Project in July 2010. The mill is located approximately 0.5 kilometers from the Aguila open pit mine. During 2010, we also began development of an underground mine to access the Arista deposit&#8217;s vein system. The Arista underground mine is located approximately two kilometers from the mill. &#160; Mining of the open pit was essentially completed in 2010. &#160; Approximately one-half of the open pit material was processed in 2010 and the remaining stockpiles are periodically processed with approximately one third remaining. The vast majority of our production from 2011 to present has been from the Arista mine . 

&#160; 

In April 2014, we announced the completion of our initial reserve study. Please s ee &#160; Item 2. Properties, Proven and Probable Reserves &#160; for more information. The Aguila Project includes approximately 30,074 hectares of mining concessions, an access road from a major highway, haul roads, a mill facility and adjoining buildings, an assay lab, an open pit and underground mine, tailings pond and other infrastructure. Please s ee &#160; Item 2. Properties for maps and additional information. 

&#160; 

Our operations in Oaxaca are conducted through our Mexican subsidiary, Don David Gold Mexico S.A. de C.V. (&#8220;DDGM&#8221; ). Our Nevada exploration is done through our wholly-owned subsidiary, GRC Nevada Inc. 

&#160; 

Our principal executive offices are located 2886 Carriage Manor Point, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80906, and our telephone number is (303) 320-7708. We maintain a website at www.goldresourcecorp.com and through a link on our website you can view the periodic filings that we make with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) , as well as certain of our corporate governance documents such as our code of ethics . The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may also obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.

Developments During 2015 &#160; 

&#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported revenue of $ 92.7 million, mine gross profit of $ 30.3 million and income of $ 3.1 million. &#160; All of our revenue is from the Aguila Project in Mexico . &#160; Our annual 2015 production from the Aguila mill totaled 29,644 gold ounces, 2,506,337 silver ounces, 1,310 copper tonnes, 4,174 lead tonnes and 13,900 zinc tonnes. In 2015, dividends distributed to shareholders totaled $0.12 per share or $6.5 million. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Oaxaca Mining Unit 

&#160; 

During 2015 , we continued to deve lop the Arista underground mine reaching Level 21 on the decline ramp by year end. We developed multiple stopes and working faces for mining, predominantly from Levels 14 to Level 19 during the year. The mining methods of long-hole stoping and cut-and-fill were utilized. 

&#160; 

We &#160; also completed phase three of the tailings impoundment facility which is estimated to provide approximately two and a half years of additional holding capacity. A phase four, in which the existing dam is lifted, is planned during 2017 &#160; and is estimated to provide an additional three year s of holding capacity . 

&#160; 

Exploration work focused on the Arista deposit, including follow-up at the Switchback vein system which is an area of mineralization approximately 500 meters northeast of the Arista vein system. D rill res ults have intercepted at least seven veins with mineralized material identified al ong a strike length of nearly 45 0 meters and a vertical depth of more than 450 meters. We developed an underground drift from Arista toward Switchback with a target of reaching the mineralized Switchback veins in 2016. Mine development plans are in place with a goal of developing additional drifts and declines to prepare for extracting mineral ized material from Switchback during the second half of 2016. In addition to testing for water, exploration from the third drill station is expected to provide an advantageous distance and drill angles to continue exploration work at Switchback . This program targets further exploration and delineation of the multiple high-grade parallel veins at Switchback, while continuing to optimize the initial mine plan. 

&#160; 

We also performed exploration at several of our other properties, including a surface drill program on portions of the Alta Gracia and Margaritas properties that focused on previously identified drill targets. 

&#160; 

Nevada Mining Unit 

&#160; 

On our Radar property in Nevada, we conducted detailed and property-wide geologic mapping and geochemical sampling as well as completing an initial 6-hole drill program consisting of 1,985 meters of core drilling . These holes targeted anomalous gold and mercury&#8211;bearing structures along a more than two kilometer trend coinciding with numerous histor ic mercury mines and prospects. Results of the exploration efforts indicated potential of bulk-tonnage high-sulfidation style gold mineralization in the northern and eastern portions of the property area where mineralized targets are hosted in favorable volcanic tuff units. Further exploration drilling is under consideration for a more adequate evaluation of the mineralized potential on the Radar property . &#160; In December 2014, t he Company leased the &#8220;Goose&#8221; gold property directly adjoi ning the Radar Project from Nevada Eagle LLC. The Goose claims add approximately 100 acres to the Company&#8217;s Nevada land holdings . &#160; 

&#160; 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, w e acquired an option to purcha se a property held by Silver Reserve Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Infrastructure Materials Corp. We refer to the property as Gold Mesa, a gold bearing property in south central Nevada&#8217;s Walker Lane Mineral Belt . We also staked 140 additional unpatented claims surrounding the original Gold Mesa property covering an area of approximately 2,800 acres. The additional claims more than double the land position, which now consists of a total of 4,580 acres, increasing our Nevada exploration potential. Although there are no work commitments pursuant to the option agreement, we are evaluating a 2016 drill campaign at Gold Mesa . T he timing will be subject to obtaining the required drill permits with a goal of extending known gold mineralization through infill and step-out drill holes . 

&#160; 

All of o ur operations in Nevada are in the exploration stage. &#160; We believe that our &#160; Nevada properties are highly prospective based on their proximity to other major gold deposits in the Walker Lane Mineral Belt which are known for their significant and high-grade gold-silver production in addition to known mineralization on the properties. We believe that our Nevada properties have excellent potential for discovery of both bulk tonnage replacement-type and bonanza-grade vein-type gold deposits, similar to other gold deposits historically mined in the Paradise Peak and Goldfield districts.

&#160;

Dividends &#160; 

&#160; 

Since July 2010, we have paid a monthly dividend . W e declared $0.11 per share and paid $0.12 per share in dividends in 2015 . At the end of 2015, the Board of Directors modified the dividend to one-sixth cent per share per month or $0.02 per share per year . Please s ee &#160; Item 5.
