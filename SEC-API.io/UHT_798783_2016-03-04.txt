Other Information

Included in our portfolio at December 31, 2015 are six hospital facilities with an aggregate investment of $130.4 million. The leases with respect to the six hospital facilities comprised approximately 29% of our consolidated revenues in 2015. The leases with respect to the seven hospital facilities, including The Bridgeway which was sold on December 31, 2014, as discussed below, comprised approximately 33% of our consolidated revenues in 2014 and approximately 36% of our consolidated revenues in 2013.

As of January 1, 2016, the leases on our six hospital facilities have fixed terms with an average of 1.8 years remaining and include renewal options ranging from one to five, five-year terms. The remaining lease terms for each hospital facility, which vary by hospital, are included herein in Item 2. Properties. 

We believe a facility&#8217;s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and lease rental expense (&#8220;EBITDAR&#8221;) and a facility&#8217;s EBITDAR divided by the sum of minimum rent plus additional rent payable to us (&#8220;Coverage Ratio&#8221;), which are non-GAAP financial measures, are helpful to us and our investors as a measure of the operating performance of a hospital facility. EBITDAR, which is used as an indicator of a facility&#8217;s estimated cash flow generated from operations (before rent expense, capital additions and debt service), is used by us in evaluating a facility&#8217;s financial viability and its ability to pay rent. For the hospital facilities owned by us at the end of each respective year (including The Bridgeway which was sold on December 31, 2014, as discussed herein), the combined weighted average Coverage Ratio was approximately 8.1 (ranging from 1.1 to 19.3) during 2015, 8.0 (ranging from 2.7 to 18.3) during 2014 and 6.3 (ranging from 2.5 to 18.5) during 2013. The Coverage Ratio for individual facilities varies. See &#8220;Relationship with Universal Health Services, Inc.&#8221; below for Coverage Ratio information related to the hospital facilities leased to subsidiaries of UHS.

Pursuant to the terms of the leases for our hospital facilities, free-standing emergency departments and the preschool and childcare centers, each lessee, including subsidiaries of UHS, is responsible for building operations, maintenance, renovations and property insurance. We, or the LLCs in which we have invested, are responsible for the building operations, maintenance and renovations of the MOBs, however, a portion, or in some cases all, of the expenses associated with the MOBs are passed on directly to the tenants. Cash reserves have been established to fund required building maintenance and renovations at the multi-tenant MOBs. Lessees are required to maintain all risk, replacement cost and commercial property insurance policies on the leased properties and we, or the LLC in which we have invested, are also named insureds on these policies. In addition, we, UHS or the LLCs in which we have invested, maintain property insurance on all properties. For additional information on the terms of our leases, see &#8220;Relationship with Universal Health Services, Inc.&#8221;

See our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for our total assets, liabilities, debt, revenues, income and other operating information.

Relationship with Universal Health Services, Inc. (&#8220;UHS&#8221;)

Leases: We commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing properties of certain subsidiaries from UHS and immediately leasing the properties back to the respective subsidiaries. Most of the leases were entered into at the time we commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional 5-year renewal terms. The current base rentals and lease and rental terms for each facility are provided below. The base rents are paid monthly and each lease also provides for additional or bonus rents which are computed and paid on a quarterly basis based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year. The hospital leases with subsidiaries of UHS are unconditionally guaranteed by UHS and are cross-defaulted with one another. 

&#160;

The combined revenues generated from the le ases on the UHS hospital facilities accounted for approximately 31% of our total revenue for the five years ended December 31, 2015 (approximately 25% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and approximately 28% and 30% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively). The decrease during 2015 and 2014 as compared to 2013 is due primarily to the 2014 purchase of the third-party minority ownership interests in eight LLCs in which we previously held noncontrolling ownership interests. As a result o f these transactions, we own 100% of each of these LLCs and began accounting for each on a consolidated basis effective on the dates of purchase of the minority ownership interests (January and August, 2014). Including 100% of the revenues generated at the unconsolidated LLCs in which we have various non-controlling equity interests ranging from 33% to 95%, the leases on the UHS hospital facilities accounted for approximately 20% of the combined consolidated and unconsolidated revenue for the five years end ed December 31, 2015 (approximately 20% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 22% for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013). In addition, including the two free-standing emergency departments (&#8220;FEDs&#8221;) acquired by us from subsidiaries of UH S during the first quarter of 2015 (as discussed below), sixteen MOBs/FEDs, that are either wholly or jointly-owned, include tenants which are subsidiaries of UHS. 

Pursuant to the Master Lease Document by and among us and certain subsidiaries of UHS, dated December 24, 1986 (the &#8220;Master Lease&#8221;), which governs the leases of all hospital properties with subsidiaries of UHS, UHS has the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described below by providing notice to us at least 90 days prior to the termination of the then current term. UHS also has the right to purchase the respective leased facilities at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms at the appraised fair market value. In addition, the Master Lease, as amended during 2006, includes a change of control provision whereby UHS has the right, upon one month&#8217;s notice should a change of control of the Trust occur, to purchase any or all of the three leased hospital properties listed below at their appraised fair market value. Additionally, UHS has rights of first refusal to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and for 180 days after the lease terms at the same price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or; (ii) renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of, and for 180 days after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer.

During the third quarter of 2014, a wholly-owned subsidiary of UHS provided notification to us that, upon expiration of The Bridgeway&#8217;s lease term which occurred in December, 2014, it intended to exercise its option to purchase the real property of the facility. Pursuant to the terms of the lease, we and the wholly-owned subsidiary of UHS were both required to obtain independent appraisals of the property to determine its fair market value. On December 31, 2014, the Bridgeway, a 103-bed behavioral health facility located in North Little Rock, Arkansas, was sold to UHS for $17.3 million. A gain on divestiture of real property of approximately $13.0 million is included in our results of operations for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2014. Prior to its divestiture in 2014, our revenues, net cash provided by operating activities and funds from operations included approximately $1.1 million earned annually in connection with The Bridgeway&#8217;s lease.

(a) 

UHS has three 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2031).

(b) 

UHS has one 5-year renewal option at existing lease rates (through 2021) and two 5-year renewal options at fair market value lease rates (2022 through 2031).

During the first quarter of 2015, we purchased from wholly-owned subsidiaries of UHS, the real property of two newly-constructed and recently opened FEDs located in Weslaco and Mission, Texas. Each FED consists of approximately 13,600 square feet and is operated by wholly-owned subsidiaries of UHS. In connection with these acquisitions, ten-year lease agreements with six, 5-year renewal terms were executed with UHS for each FED. The first four, 5-year renewal terms (covering years 2025 through 2044) include 2% annual lease rate increases, computed on accumulative and compounded basis, and the last two, 5-year renewal terms (covering the years 2045 through 2054) will be at the then fair market value lease rates. These leases are cross-defaulted with one another. UHS has the option to purchase the leased properties upon the expiration of the fixed term and each five-year extended term at the fair market value at that time. The aggregate acquisition cost of these facilities was approximately $12.8 million, and the aggregate rental revenue earned by us at the commencement of the leases is approximately $900,000 annually.

Management cannot predict whether the leases with subsidiaries of UHS, which have renewal options at existing lease rates or fair market value lease rates, or any of our other leases, will be renewed at the end of their lease term. If the leases are not renewed at their current rates or the fair market value lease rates, we would be required to find other operators for those facilities and/or enter into 

&#160;

leases on terms potentially less favorable to us than the current leases. In addition, if subsidiaries of UHS exercise their options to purchase the respective leased hospital and FED facilities upon expiration of the lease terms, our future revenues could decrease if we were unable to earn a favorable rate of return on the sale proceeds received, as compared to the rental revenue currently earned pursuant to the these leases. The existing lease terms for our three acute care hospitals operated by wholly-owned subsidiaries of UHS are scheduled to expire in December, 2016 and we can provide no assurance that these leases will be renewed at the existing lease rates. 

Advisory Agreement: UHS of Delaware, Inc. (the &#8220;Advisor&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of UHS, serves as Advisor to us under an Advisory Agreement (the &#8220;Advisory Agreement&#8221;) dated December 24, 1986. Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor is obligated to present an investment program to us, to use its best efforts to obtain investments suitable for such program (although it is not obligated to present any particular investment opportunity to us), to provide administrative services to us and to conduct our day-to-day affairs. All transactions between us and UHS must be approved by the Trustees who are unaffiliated with UHS (the &#8220;Independent Trustees&#8221;). In performing its services under the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor may utilize independent professional services, including accounting, legal, tax and other services, for which the Advisor is reimbursed directly by us. The Advisory Agreement may be terminated for any reason upon sixty days written notice by us or the Advisor. 

The Advisory Agreement expires on December 31 of each year; however, it is renewable by us, subject to a determination by the Independent Trustees, that the Advisor&#8217;s performance has been satisfactory. Our advisory fee was 0.70% during each of 2015, 2014 and 2013 of our average invested real estate assets, as derived from our consolidated balance sheet. In December of 2015, based upon a review of our advisory fee and other general and administrative expenses, as compared to an industry peer group, the Advisory Agreement was renewed for 2016 pursuant to the same terms as the Advisory Agreement in place during the last three years.

The average real estate assets for advisory fee calculation purposes exclude certain items from our consolidated balance sheet such as, among other things, accumulated depreciation, cash and cash equivalents, base and bonus rent receivables, deferred charges and other assets. The advisory fee is payable quarterly, subject to adjustment at year-end based upon our audited financial statements. In addition, the Advisor is entitled to an annual incentive fee equal to 20% of the amount by which cash available for distribution to shareholders for each year, as defined in the Advisory Agreement, exceeds 15% of our equity as shown on our consolidated balance sheet, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles without reduction for return of capital dividends. The Advisory Agreement defines cash available for distribution to shareholders as net cash flow from operations less deductions for, among other things, amounts required to discharge our debt and liabilities and reserves for replacement and capital improvements to our properties and investments. No incentive fees were paid during 2015, 2014 or 2013 since the incentive fee requirements were not achieved. Advisory fees incurred and paid (or payable) to UHS amounted to $2.8 million during 2015, $2.5 million during 2014 and $2.4 million during 2013 and were based upon average invested real estate assets of $401 million, $363 million and $338 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Officers and Employees: Our officers are all employees of a wholly-owned subsidiary of UHS and although as of December 31, 2015 we had no salaried employees, our officers do typically receive annual stock-based compensation awards in the form of restricted stock. In special circumstances, if warranted and deemed appropriate by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Trustees, our officers may also receive one-time compensation awards in the form of restricted stock and/or cash bonuses. 

Share Ownership: As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, UHS owned 5.9% of our outstanding shares of beneficial interest. 

SEC reporting requirements of UHS: UHS is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) and is required to file annual reports containing audited financial information and quarterly reports containing unaudited financial information. Since the leases on the hospital facilities leased to wholly-owned subsidiaries of UHS comprised approximately 25% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 28% and 30% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and since a subsidiary of UHS is our Advisor, you are encouraged to obtain the publicly available filings for Universal Health Services, Inc. from the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov. These filings are the sole responsibility of UHS and are not incorporated by reference herein. 

Taxation

We believe we have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner. If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to shareholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the &#8220;double taxation&#8221;, i.e. , at the corporate and shareholder levels, that usually results from investment in the stock of a corporation.

Please see the heading &#8220; If we fail to maintain our REIT status, we will become subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates&#8221; under &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for more information.

&#160;

Competition 

We compete for the acquisition, leasing and financing of health care related facilities. Our competitors include, but are not limited to, other REITs, banks and other companies, including UHS. Some of these competitors are larger and may have a lower cost of capital than we do. These developments could result in fewer investment opportunities for us and lower spreads over the cost of our capital, which would hurt our growth.

In most geographical areas in which our facilities operate, there are other facilities that provide services comparable to those offered by our facilities. In addition, some competing facilities are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sales and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to certain operators of our facilities, including UHS. In some markets, certain competing facilities may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than those available at our facilities. Certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty hospitals that provide medical, surgical and behavioral health services that may not be provided by the operators of our hospitals. The increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities, ambulatory surgical centers and freestanding emergency departments also increases competition for us.

In addition, the number and quality of the physicians on a hospital&#8217;s staff are important factors in determining a hospital&#8217;s success and competitive advantage. Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admission decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment. The operators of our facilities also compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel. From time-to-time, the operators of our acute care hospitals may experience the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide, which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries, wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate. Our operators may experience difficulties attracting and retaining qualified physicians, nurses and medical support personnel. We anticipate that our operators, including UHS, will continue to encounter increased competition in the future that could lead to a decline in patient volumes and harm their businesses, which in turn, could harm our business.

A large portion of our non-hospital properties consist of MOBs which are located either close to or on the campuses of hospital facilities. These properties are either directly or indirectly affected by the factors discussed above as well as general real estate factors such as the supply and demand of office space and market rental rates. To improve our competitive position, we anticipate that we will continue investing in additional healthcare related facilities and leasing the facilities to qualified operators, perhaps including subsidiaries of UHS.

Regulation and Other Factors

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, 25%, 25% and 28%, respectively, of our revenues were earned pursuant to leases with operators of acute care services hospitals, all of which are subsidiaries of UHS. A significant portion of the revenue earned by the operators of our acute care hospitals is derived from federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid (excluding managed Medicare and Medicaid programs).

Our hospital facilities derive a significant portion of their revenue from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and, in some cases, reduced levels of reimbursement for healthcare services. Payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities. Neither we nor the operators of our hospital facilities are able to predict the effect of recent and future policy changes on our respective results of operations. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of, among other things, the funding requirements and other provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs. If the rates paid or the scope of services covered by government payors are reduced, there could be a material adverse effect on the business, financial position and results of operations of the operators of our hospital facilities, and in turn, ours.

In addition, the healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things: hospital billing practices and prices for services; relationships with physicians and other referral sources; adequacy of medical care and quality of medical equipment and services; ownership of facilities; qualifications of medical and support personnel; confidentiality, maintenance, privacy and security issues associated with health-related information and patient medical records; the screening, stabilization and transfer of patients who have emergency medical conditions; certification, licensure and accreditation of our facilities; operating policies and procedures, and; construction or expansion of facilities and services.

&#160;

These laws and regulations are extremely complex, and, in many cases, the operators of our facilities do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation. In the future, it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject the current or past practices of our o perators to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require them to make changes in their facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. Although UHS and the other operators of our hospital facili ties believe that their policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that they will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions, or that they would not be faced with sanctions, fine s or penalties if so subjected. Even if they were to ultimately prevail, a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws, regulations or rules could have a material adverse effect upon them, and in turn, us. 

Each of our hospital facilities is deemed certified, meaning that they are accredited, properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the Medicare program. The effect of maintaining certified facilities is to allow such facilities to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The operators of our hospital facilities believe that the facilities are in material compliance with applicable federal, state, local and other relevant regulations and standards. However, should any of our hospital facilities lose their deemed certified status and thereby lose certification under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from either of those programs and their business, and in turn, ours, could be materially adversely affected.

The various factors and government regulation related to the healthcare industry, such as those outlined above, affects us because:

(i) 

The financial ability of lessees to make rent payments to us may be affected by governmental regulations such as licensure, certification for participation in government programs, and government reimbursement, and;

(ii) 

Our bonus rents on the three acute care hospitals operated by subsidiaries of UHS are based on our lessees&#8217; net revenues which in turn are affected by the amount of reimbursement such lessees receive from the government.

A significant portion of the revenue earned by the operators of our acute care hospitals is derived from federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Under the statutory framework of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, many of the general acute care operations are subject to administrative rulings, interpretations and discretion that may affect payments made under either or both of such programs as well as by other third party payors. The federal government makes payments to participating hospitals under its Medicare program based on various formulas. For inpatient services, the operators of our acute care hospitals are subject to an inpatient prospective payment system (&#8220;IPPS&#8221;). Under IPPS, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge. The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient&#8217;s Medicare severity diagnosis related group (&#8220;MS-DRG&#8221;). Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis. These rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care. The MS-DRG rates are adjusted annually based on geographic region and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity.

For outpatient services, acute care hospitals are paid under an outpatient prospective payment system (&#8220;PPS&#8221;) according to ambulatory procedure codes. The outpatient PPS rate is a geographic adjusted national payment amount that includes the Medicare payment and the beneficiary co-payment. Special payments under the outpatient PPS may be made for certain new technology items and services through transitional pass-through payments and special reimbursement rates.

Three of our acute care hospital facilities operated by subsidiaries of UHS and two sub-acute care hospital facilities operated by an unaffiliated third-party are located in Texas, Florida, California and Illinois. The majority of these states have reported significant budget deficits that have resulted in reductions of Medicaid funding at various times during the last few years and which could adversely affect future levels of Medicaid reimbursement received by certain operators of our facilities, including the operators of our hospital facilities. We can provide no assurance that reductions to Medicaid revenues earned by operators of certain of our facilities, particularly our hospital operators in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on the future operating results of those operators which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us.
