 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

OVERVIEW 

&#160; 

We were originally incorporated in the state of New York in 1994 as Intelli-Check, Inc. In August 1999, we reincorporated in Delaware. On March 14, 2008, our corporation was renamed Intelli-Check - Mobilisa, Inc. after the consummation of the merger with Mobilisa, Inc. (&#8220;Mobilisa&#8221;) (references to &#8220;Intelli-Check&#8221; in this annual report refer to the Company prior to the merger with Mobilisa). At the closing of the merger, our headquarters were moved to Mobilisa&#8217;s offices in Port Townsend, Washington. On October 27, 2009, we made a further change in our name to Intellicheck Mobilisa, Inc. (&#8220;Intellicheck Mobilisa,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;the Company&#8221;). On August 31, 2009, the Company acquired 100% of the common stock of Positive Access Corporation (&#8220;Positive Access&#8221;), a developer of driver license reading technology. The acquisition of Positive Access expanded the Company&#8217;s technology portfolio and related product offerings and allowed the Company to reach a larger number of customers through Positive Access&#8217;s extensive distribution network. On October 27, 2015 we announced that our headquarters have been relocated to its Jericho, New York facility. 

&#160; 

We are a technology company engaged in developing, integrating and marketing identity systems for various applications including mobile and handheld access control and security systems for the government, military and commercial markets. Our products include the Defense ID &#174; and Fugitive Finder systems, advanced ID card access control products currently protecting military and federal locations, and ID-Check, a patented technology that instantly reads, analyzes, and verifies encoded data in magnetic stripes and barcodes on government-issue IDs from U.S. and Canadian jurisdictions designed to improve the customer experience for the financial, hospitality and retail sectors. 

&#160; 

We plan to expand our business in the near term by pursuing a research and development strategy designed to move our technologies into new product markets that are expected to benefit from enhanced safety, regulatory compliance and fraud prevention. For example, we anticipate extending our technologies into the healthcare and first responder spaces and to online applications to provide enhanced safety, regulatory compliance and fraud prevention for the billions of transactions that occur there each day. 

&#160; 

As a complement to these new offerings, we are also developing a data analytics platform to analyze the data we capture and to provide meaningful data, trend and predictive analysis to a variety of customers in the commercial and government spaces. 

&#160; 

We sold our wireless enterprise assets on August 31, 2015 in order to focus the company resources on our core identity authentication business. 

&#160; 

We plan to leverage our IP in the new markets we are targeting to strengthen our competitive position. 

&#160; 

Our primary businesses include Identity Systems products, which include commercial applications of identity card reading and verification and government sales of defense security and identity card applications. 

&#160; 

Our technologies address problems such as: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Commercial Fraud and Risk Management &#8211; which may lead to economic losses to merchants from check cashing, debit and credit card, as well as other types of fraud such as identity theft that principally use fraudulent identification cards as proof of identity; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Instant Credit Card Approval &#8211; retail stores use our technology to scan a driver license at a kiosk or at the Point Of Sale (POS) and send the information to a credit card underwriter to get instant approval for a loyalty-branded credit card. This technique protects consumer data and is significantly more likely to result in a completed transaction compared to in-store personnel asking customers to fill out a paper form; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Unauthorized Access &#8211; our systems and software are designed to increase security and deter terrorism at airports, shipping ports, rail and bus terminals, military installations, high profile buildings and infrastructure where security is a concern; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Inefficiencies Associated With Manual Data Entry &#8211; by reading encoded data contained in the bar code and magnetic stripe of an identification card with a quick swipe or scan of the card, where permitted by law, customers are capable of accurately and instantaneously inputting information into forms, applications and the like without the errors associated with manual data entry. &#160; 

IDENTITY CARD READING AND VERIFICATION SECTOR 

&#160; 

Background on Identification Documentation 

&#160; 

Driver license 

&#160; 

The driver license is the most widely used form of government issued photo identification in North America. The Real ID Act, which became federal law in May 2005, recognizes that the driver license is also a quasi-identification card. In addition to its primary function, the driver license is used to verify identity for social services, firearm sales, check cashing, credit card issuance and use and other applications. Our technology can read the electronically stored information on all currently issued driver licenses (even those that do not comply with the AAMVA/ANSI/ISO standards). Today, all 50 states, the District of Columbia and all 13 Canadian provinces/territories electronically store information on their driver license. 

&#160; 

Non-driver identification card 

&#160; 

Each U.S. and Canadian Jurisdiction also provides a non-driver identification card as an alternative form of identification for those unable to acquire a driver license. These identification cards are issued with most of the same data found on a driver license. Military documents also provide a means of identification and contain encoded data as well. Since driver licenses are the most widely used form of legally acceptable government documentation, we refer to all these identification documents as &#8220;driver licenses.&#8221; Our ID&#8730;Check &#174; software is capable of performing its function on all these forms of identification. 

&#160; 

Current Challenges Associated with Verifying Identification Documents 

&#160; 

The high-tech revolution has created a major problem for those who rely on identification documents. In an age where scanners, computers and color printers are commonplace, fake IDs of the highest quality are easily obtainable from a number of locations including college campuses and from multiple sites on the Internet. These fakes appear so real, even law enforcement agencies have encountered difficulty distinguishing them from legally issued documents. Additionally, these high-tech devices have the ability to easily alter properly issued ID. Therefore, anyone can gain access to a false identity that gives them the ability, in a commercial transaction, to present fake and stolen credit cards or checks that are supported by false identification. Additionally, starting with only a fraudulent driver license, an individual may be able to create multiple identities, commit fraud, buy age restricted products such as alcohol and tobacco while underage, evade law enforcement and engage in other criminal activities, such as: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; committing identity theft; &#160; &#9679; gaining entrance to high profile buildings and sensitive infrastructures, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; improperly boarding airplanes; &#160; &#9679; engaging in medical fraud; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; committing credit card, debit card and check cashing fraud; &#160; &#9679; purchasing age restricted products such as alcohol and tobacco while under age; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; illegally purchasing firearms; &#160; &#9679; obtaining welfare or other government benefits. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; unlawfully committing pharmacy fraud, including false narcotic prescriptions; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; committing refund fraud; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Given the ease with which identification can be falsified, simply looking at a driver license may not be sufficient to verify age or identity and determine whether or not it is fraudulent. Since merchants are facing significant economic losses due to these frauds, we believe that a document verification system which can accurately read the electronically stored information is needed. We possess patented technology that provides an analysis of the data contained on the encoded formats of these identification documents by reading and analyzing the encoded format on the magnetic stripe or bar code on the driver license and comparing it against known standards. We believe that we are the only company able to do this for all U.S. jurisdictions and that no other company could provide a similar service without infringing on our patents.

ID&#8730;Check &#174; Family &#8212; Solutions and Benefits 

&#160; 

Our patented ID&#8730;Check &#174; technology is our advanced document verification software. ID&#8730;Check &#174; is contained in our software products and is capable of reading and verifying in one swipe or scan the encoded format contained on U.S. and Canadian driver licenses, state issued non-driver identification cards, and military IDs. Our technology has the ability to verify the encoded formats on all currently encoded documents, even those that do not comply with the standards of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (&#8217;&#8216;AAMVA&#8217;&#8217;), the American National Standards Institute (&#8217;&#8216;ANSI&#8217;&#8217;) and the International Standards Organization (&#8217;&#8216;ISO&#8217;&#8217;). 

&#160; 

We believe that ID&#8730;Check &#174; and our family of software solutions contain the most advanced, reliable and effective technology, providing users with an easy, reliable, and cost-effective method of document and age verification. We have received/acquired encoding formats from multiple sources. This information, combined with our patented technology, enables all of our ID&#8730;Check &#174; software products to read, decode, process and verify the encoded formats on driver licenses. As jurisdictions change their documents and guidelines, we believe our software can be adapted to these changes. 

&#160; 

The ID&#8730;Check &#174; technology is embedded in many of our product lines including Retail ID &#8482; , Law ID &#8482; , Defense ID &#174; , Age ID &#8482; , Guest ID &#8482; , Access ID &#8482; , and TWIC ID &#8482; some of which are discussed below. 

&#160; 

ID&#8730;Check &#174; software does not require a connection to a central database to operate, thus negating privacy concerns. Many of our products have the ability to operate add-on peripherals such as printers, fingerprint readers and other devices. 

&#160; 

The ID&#8730;Check &#174; process is quick, simple and easy to use. After matching the driver license photograph to the person presenting the document for identification, the user simply scans or swipes the driver license through a data capture device. The software quickly determines if: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; the format of the document is valid; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the document has been altered or is fake, by displaying the parsed, encoded data for comparison with the printed information; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the document has expired; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the encoded data contains a date of birth equal to or greater than the legal age to purchase age restricted products, such as alcohol and tobacco. &#160; 

Then, the ID&#8730;Check &#174; software applications can: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; respond to the user by displaying the format verification result and the parsed information; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; save information that is permissible by law to memory; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; print a record of the transaction including the verification results if a printer is part of the hardware configuration. &#160;

Defense ID &#174; System 

&#160; 

Our Defense ID &#174; System offers law enforcement personnel and military security officers additional information for protecting their facilities. The Defense ID System uses rugged, handheld, mobile devices and desktop visitor/vendor approval workstations to read barcodes, magnetic stripes, RFID (radio frequency identification) and OCR (optical character recognition) codes printed on current forms of identification cards. By scanning and comparing the information contained on the ID card to over 100 databases, Defense ID &#174; can immediately determine if the card has been reported lost or stolen, the individual&#8217;s identity information matches watch lists or law enforcement databases, or if they are on an authorized roster of previously-cleared personnel. In 2008, our Defense ID &#174; System received a U.S. Navy-wide certification and accreditation referred to as an Authority to Operate (&#8217;&#8216;ATO&#8217;&#8217;), and in 2009, our Defense ID &#174; System received U.S. Army-wide, U.S. Marine Corps-wide and U.S. Air Force-wide ATOs. We believe these ATOs will facilitate further deployment of the Defense ID &#174; System at military bases and facilities.

Our Target Industry Sectors 

&#160; 

Commercial Identity Systems 

&#160; 

The use of false identification cards, primarily driver licenses and non-driver identification cards, to engage in commercial fraud, to gain access to unauthorized areas and to gain entry to critical infrastructure is all too common. Given the ease with which identification can be falsified, we believe that simply looking at a driver license is not sufficient to verify identity and determine whether or not such an identification card is fraudulent. Since merchants are facing significant economic losses due to these frauds, we believe that what they need is a document verification system that can accurately read the electronically stored information. We target the industry sectors that would most benefit from our systems and software. 

&#160; 

We also market our products to opportunities where our ID&#8730;Check &#174; technology can be used to enhance productivity. We have made significant progress in the sectors for the retail issuance of instant credit. We believe there are financial benefits and compelling business models for customers in this sector to utilize our technology.

Government Identity Systems 

&#160; 

Our Defense ID &#174; system is tailored to locations that validate identification cards as a means of access. Historically, the military sector has been the primary focus, followed closely by Sea Ports, Oil Refineries and the law enforcement sector. Military bases, for example, are an ideal location for the use of the Defense ID &#174; system because individual ID cards are checked prior to allowing base access and, in most cases, bases issue visitor/vendor passes to individuals needing access that do not possess a military ID. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Because Defense ID &#174; is customizable, it can be used in many different environments. The information provided via instant access to multiple law enforcement databases proves invaluable to gate officers and law enforcement personnel ensuring the security of a facility. Current targets include:

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION 

&#160; 

Commercial Identity Systems 

&#160; 

Our objective is to become the leading developer and distributor of document and age verification products. To date, our marketing efforts have been through direct sales by our sales and marketing personnel, through resellers and license agreements. We are marketing our products through direct marketing approaches such as web marketing, a small number of select trade shows and well known public interest and trade associations. 

&#160; 

We generate revenues from the licensing of our software and the selling of bundled solutions that contain hardware and software. Depending on the specific needs of our clients, we tailor the right solution for them. Our bundled solutions are sold as a Software as a Service (SaaS). 

&#160; 

Our ID&#8730;Check &#174; software is available to customers via the cloud (SaaS) and available for Microsoft Windows and Windows Mobile platforms in addition to devices such as credit card terminals and other operating systems such as Linux. We are marketing our ID&#8730;Check &#174; technology to the government, airlines, airports, high profile buildings or infrastructure, mass merchandisers, grocery, convenience and pharmacy chains, casinos and banks. 

&#160; 

We have developed a comprehensive marketing plan to build customer awareness and develop brand recognition in our target industry sectors. We promote the advantages and ease of use of our products through: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Endorsements by nationally known public interest groups and trade associations; &#160; &#9679; Web seminars, as well as our own website; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Trade publications; &#160; &#9679; Various conventions and industry specific seminars. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Trade shows; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

We intend to continue to develop and market other related software applications. 

&#160; 

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Government Identity Solutions 

&#160; 

We have sector-specific brochures for each product in our product line for both the military, port and law enforcement sectors that the sales force utilizes when demonstrating the Defense ID &#174; system to potential customers. These brochures serve as a quick reference guide outlining the capabilities of our technology. Once customers have a clear understanding of our products, they can use these brochures to discuss their individual needs and ordering requirements. 

&#160; 

When dealing with military and government entities, we must comply with applicable procurement regulations. 

&#160; 

In addition to sole source awards, we also respond to Requests for Proposal (&#8220;RFPs&#8221;) and Requests for Qualifications (&#8220;RFQs&#8221;) when our technological capabilities meet that of the desired system. In many cases, we are the only company that is able to meet the requirements in the RFP, which can lead to a quick and easy award. 

&#160; 

Also, we have all Defense ID &#174; products, as well as individual labor services, listed on GSA Schedule 70. This makes it possible for government entities to make direct purchases of equipment and services for a pre-negotiated price without having to go through the formal RFP/Bid process. 

&#160; 

We have offices in New York and Washington State to fully support our current and potential customers. This makes it easy to schedule and complete installations and maintenance in an efficient, time-conscious manner. 

&#160; 

MAJOR CUSTOMERS 

&#160; 

Although the composition of our largest customers has changed from year to year, a significant portion of our revenues have been attributable to a limited number of major customers. In 2015, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 59% of total revenues. In 2014, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 44% of total revenues. While we believe that one or more major customers could account for a significant portion of our sales for at least the next two years, we anticipate that our customer base will continue to expand and that in the future we will be less dependent on major customers. 

&#160; 

REGULATION 

&#160; 

The sale and use of the Company&#8217;s Identity System products are not subject to regulation by government authorities. We believe we are currently in compliance with applicable United States, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

Commercial Identity Systems 

&#160; 

We compete in an industry that is intensely competitive and rapidly changing. Unless a device can read, decode and analyze all of the information that is legally permitted to be analyzed, which is electronically stored on a driver license, the user may not obtain accurate and reliable confirmation that a driver license is valid and has not been altered or tampered with. We are aware of several companies that are currently offering products that electronically read and calculate age from a driver license. We have tested and compared some of these products to ID&#8730;Check &#174; and believe that our product is superior in quality and functionality. We believe that units unable to read bar codes are at a significant disadvantage because all states and Canadian provinces currently utilize bar codes to encode their driver licenses, as well as all U.S. military IDs and uniformed services cards. 

&#160; 

In the government identity sector, there are several companies, including MorphoTrust USA, EID Passport and HID Global that are currently offering products that compete with the Defense ID &#174; system. The U.S. government also has DBIDS and AIE that compete with our products. 

&#160; 

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We are also aware that Motorola and Honeywell are offering an embedded driver&#8217;s license reading solution on a tether scanner. 

&#160; 

We have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition in the document verification sector. If any of our competitors were to become the industry standard or were to enter into or expand relationships with significantly larger companies through mergers, acquisitions or otherwise, our business and operating results could be seriously harmed. In addition, potential competitors could bundle their products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products. 

&#160; 

MANUFACTURING 

&#160; 

We do not manufacture readers or input devices, but use products from several manufacturers. Some of these devices are private labeled and programmed by the supplier to work with our ID&#8730;Check &#174; technology. The majority of our hardware consists of commercial off-the-shelf (&#8220;COTS&#8221;) products. We rely on a small number of suppliers to provide our COTS products. 

&#160; 

Our government identity systems products are created with COTS items that we customize with software and specialized configurations. All products are customized, assembled, and tested in-house and then installed and placed by our employees in the field. 

&#160; 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

&#160; 

Our research and development efforts are mainly concentrated in two areas. The most significant effort is concentrated in the identity sector. We modify existing software applications based on customer&#8217;s requirements, which are fee based. In addition, we develop new software solutions and make improvements to existing software platforms, which are funded internally. R&#38;D spending during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $2,594,678 and $1,823,147, respectively. 

&#160; 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

&#160; 

We currently hold twenty-two (22) U.S. patents, two (2) Canadian patents and one (1) United Kingdom patent. At present, we have other patent applications pending in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as well as internationally. These patents cover commercially important aspects of our capabilities relating to the authentication and verification of identification documents, and relating to our Defense ID &#174; System technology. We will continue to pursue patents for all of our new technologies arising from our research and development efforts. 

&#160; 

In January 1999, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted us a patent on our ID&#8730;Check &#174; software technology. In October 2002, we were granted another patent relating to our document authentication and age verification technology. In January 2009, we were granted another patent that is a continuation of our patents relating to our document authentication and age verification technology. Upon our acquisition of the assets of IDentiScan, we also received equitable ownership and sole ownership rights to its intellectual property, including other patents and patent applications relating to age verification technology. 

&#160; 

During 2010, we were granted two additional patents. The first patent was for a software key control for mobile devices. It is used to get a registration key for the parser that is based on the unique internal ID of one mobile device. The Mobile Key Manager communicates with the mobile device, reading its ID, and then requests a registration key specific for that ID from Intellicheck Mobilisa&#8217;s server. This server maintains a database of all customers using IDecode Mobile Parsers, including the number of licenses they have purchased, the latest software version for which they have paid support, and the registration keys and unique device IDs associated with those licenses. The server generates a new registration key unique to the device ID, and returns it to the Mobile Key Manager to register that device. In this way, the customer can deploy the IDecode Mobile Parser to only one mobile device for each parser purchased. 

&#160; 

The second patent was relating to a document comparison system and reinforces the innovative nature of Intellicheck Mobilisa&#8217;s security solutions involving documents. The technology described in the patent relates to a system and method for comparing information contained in at least two documents. Like information on different documents is compared to determine whether the information is the same on each document. For instance, a name contained on an individual&#8217;s driver&#8217;s license is automatically compared with a name contained on the individual&#8217;s airline boarding pass. 

&#160; 

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In 2011, we were issued another patent. This patent allows for verifying and authenticating the encoded information on driver licenses of all 50 states and other North American driver licenses, and allows the information to be electronically transferred in a secure environment to a local or remote jurisdiction for age verification, organ donor, or criminal activity checks critical in fighting both crime and terrorism. 

&#160; 

In 2012, we were granted a patent relating to a system and method for comparing information contained in at least two documents, but not limited to just a driver license and passport. This patent compares &#8220;like information&#8221; on different documents to determine whether the information is the same on each document. As an example, a passport is compared to a boarding pass to determine &#8220;like information&#8221; matches, for instance name and birthdate. 

&#160; 

We were also granted a patent related to a system that uses environmental information to determine a level of scrutiny that is to be applied to identification information received at a location where user identification is being checked. Depending on the level of scrutiny that is applied and on generated candidate scores, the system will display a number of potential persons of interest that match the received identification information. 

&#160; 

In 2013, we were granted four patents that are continuations of earlier-filed applications we previously filed. One patent is related to a document comparison system that compares information contained in two documents to determine whether the information is substantially identical on each document. An indication is provided as to whether the two documents identify the same entity or do not identify the same entity. The second patent relates to improvements to software key control for mobile devices. The third patent relates to an apparatus for extracting date of birth information from driver&#8217;s licenses and displaying a calculated age along with a license background graphic. Finally, the fourth patent is related to a system that uses environmental information to determine a level of scrutiny that is to be applied to identification information received at a location and to display a number of potential persons of interest that match the received identification information based on the applied level of scrutiny. 

&#160; 

In 2014, we were granted one patent that was also a continuation of an earlier-filed application. The patent is related to a document comparison system that compares information contained in two documents to determine whether certain information is substantially identical on each document. The system provides a positive or negative indication as to whether portions of the two documents are substantially identical. 

&#160; 

In 2015, we acquired an intellectual property portfolio that includes four patents involving technologies for checking the validity of identification documents using a remote database. Certain patents in this portfolio address the use of biometric information and identification credentials as part of the process to control access to a secured area. 

&#160; 

We were also granted two patents in 2015. The first patent is related to a system and method for comparing documents. The second patent is identity matching in response to threat levels. 

&#160; 

We own multiple copyrights in the United States, which are effective in Canada and in other major industrial countries. The copyright protection covers software source codes and supporting graphics relating to the operation of ID&#8730;Check &#174; and other software products. We also have several trademarks relating to our company, its product names and logos. 

&#160; 

In connection with the sales or licensing of our intellectual property, we have entered into an agreement with Mr. Kevin Messina, our former Senior Executive V.P. and Chief Technology Officer, under which we will pay royalties equal to 0.005% of cumulative gross sales for cumulative gross sales of $2,000,000 to $52,000,000 and 0.0025% of cumulative gross sales for cumulative gross sales in excess of $52,000,000 pertaining to those patents on which Mr. Messina was identified as an inventor. Cumulatively, as of December 31, 2015, total fees paid under this agreement were about $1,757. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 24, 2016, we had twenty-two (22) full-time employees. Four (4) are engaged in executive management, eight (8) in information technology, five (5) in sales and marketing and five (5) in administration. All employees are employed &#8220;at will.&#8221; We believe our relations with our employees are generally positive and we have no collective bargaining agreements with any labor unions. 

&#160; 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

&#160; 

Share Repurchase 

&#160; 

On February 24, 2016, we entered into a Stock Repurchase Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with Nelson Ludlow, the Company&#8217;s former chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors, and Bonnie Ludlow, the Company&#8217;s former senior vice president and director. Pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed to repurchase 979,114 shares of our common stock owned by Nelson Ludlow and Bonnie Ludlow at a price of $1.12 per share. The transaction closed on March 4, 2016. 

&#160; 

Lease Amendment 

&#160; 

On February 24, 2016, Mobilisa, Inc., our subsidiary, entered into the First Amendment to Lease Agreement (the &#8220;Lease Amendment&#8221;) with Eagle Coast, LLC, a Washington limited liability company (the &#8220;Landlord&#8221;). The Lease Amendment amends the Lease Agreement with the Landlord, dated August 1, 2007 (the &#8220;Lease&#8221;), for the Company&#8217;s offices located at 191 Otto Street, Port Townsend, Washington 98368, and provides for, among other things, a reduction in the size of the premises subject to the Lease effective March 31, 2016, and amends the expiration date of the lease from July 31, 2017 to December 31, 2016. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Lease Amendment, Mobilisa, Inc. is required to pay $100,000.00 to the Landlord in full satisfaction of its remaining payment obligations under the Lease. After such payment, Mobilisa, Inc. will not be required to pay any additional rent or other sums to the Landlord for its continued occupancy and possession of the premises through December 31, 2016.
