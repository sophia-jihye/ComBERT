Overview 

The Company makes impact investments in Small and Medium Enterprises, or SMEs, primarily in developing economies that provide the opportunity to achieve both competitive financial returns and positive measurable impact. We were organized as a Delaware limited liability company on April 30, 2012. We believe that we operate and intend to operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940. We invest in SMEs through local market sub-advisors and our objective is to build a diversified portfolio of financial assets, including direct loans, convertible debt instruments, trade finance, structured credit and preferred and common equity investments. We anticipate that a substantial portion of our assets will continue to consist of collateralized private debt instruments, which we believe offer opportunities for competitive risk-adjusted returns through income generation. We are externally managed and advised by TriLinc Advisors. 

To assist the Company in achieving its investment objective, the Company makes investments via wholly owned subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has six subsidiaries, all of which are Cayman Islands exempted companies. To assist the Advisor in managing the Company and its subsidiaries, the Advisor may provide services via TriLinc Advisors International, Ltd. (&#8220;TAI&#8221;), a Cayman Islands exempted company that is wholly owned by TriLinc Advisors, LLC. 

Our business strategy is to generate competitive financial returns and positive economic, social and/or environmental impact by providing financing to SMEs, primarily in developing economies, defined as countries with national income classified by the World Bank as upper-middle income and below. Our style of investment is referred to as impact investing, which J.P. Morgan Global Research and Rockefeller Foundation in a 2010 report called &#8220;an emerging alternative asset class&#8221; and defined as investing with the intent to create positive impact beyond financial return. We believe it is possible to generate competitive financial returns while creating positive, measurable impact. Through our investments in SMEs, we intend to enable job creation and stimulate economic growth. 

Our investment objectives are to provide our unitholders current income, capital preservation and modest capital appreciation. These objectives are achieved primarily through SME trade finance and term loan financing, while employing rigorous risk mitigation and due diligence practices, and transparently measuring and reporting the economic, social and environmental impacts of our investments. The majority of our investments are senior secured trade finance, senior secured loans, and other collateralized loans or loan participations to SMEs with established, profitable businesses in developing economies. With our sub-advisors, we expect to provide growth capital financing generally ranging in size from $5-15 million per transaction for direct SME loans and $500,000 to $5 million for trade finance transactions. We will seek to protect and grow investor capital by: (1) targeting countries with favorable economic growth and investor protections; (2) partnering with sub-advisors with significant experience in local markets; (3) focusing on creditworthy lending targets which have at least 3-year operating histories and demonstrated cash flows enabling loan repayment; (4) making primarily debt investments, backed by collateral and borrower guarantees; (5) employing best practices in our due diligence and risk mitigation processes; and (6) monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. 

Our goal is to create a diversified portfolio of primarily private debt instruments, including trade finance and term loans, whose counterparties are small and medium-size businesses in developing economies. Private debt facilities generate current income and in some cases offer the potential for modest capital appreciation, while maintaining a higher place in a company&#8217;s capital structure than the equity held by the owners and other investors. As small and growing businesses, our borrowers have used and we expect them to continue to use capital to expand operations, improve the financial standing of their operations, or finance the trade of their goods. According to the most recent IFC SME Banking Guide, SMEs have been shown to improve job creation and GDP growth throughout the world, and we expect the portfolio of our investments to have a positive, measurable impact in their communities, in addition to offering a competitive financial return to the investor.

On February 25, 2013, our reg istration statement on Form S-1 was declared effective by the SEC. Pursuant to the registration statement, we are offering on a continuous basis up to $1 .5 billion in units of our limited liability company interest, consistin g of up to $1. 2 5 billion of un its in our primary offering, consisting of Class A units at the initial offering price of $10.00 per unit, Class C units at $9.576 per unit and Class I units at $9.186 per unit, which we refer to as the Primary Offering, and up to $25 0 million of units pur suant to our distribution reinvestment plan, which we refer to as the Distribution Reinvestment Plan, and which we collectively refer to as the Offering.

In June 2013, we satisfied our minimum offering requirement of $2,000,000 when the Sponsor purchased 321,330 Class A units for aggregate gross proceeds of $2,900,000 and we commenced operations.

On November 18, 2015, our board of managers elected to extend the Offering for up to an additional six month period, expiring August 25, 2016. In February 2016, our board elected to further extend the Offering to December 31, 2016. Our board has the right to terminate the Offering at any time. As of December 31, 2015, we had received subscriptions for and issued 16,252,647 of our units, including 305,480 units issued under our Distribution Reinvestment Plan, for gross proceeds of approximately $156,473,000 including approximately $3,620,000 reinvested under our Distribution Reinvestment Plan, (before dealer-manager fees of approximately $2,198,000 and selling commissions of $7,597,000, for net proceeds of $146,678,000).

On November 20, 2015, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC in connection with the proposed offering of up to $1.15 billion in units of our limited liability company interest, including $150.0 million in units to be issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (the &#8220;Follow-On Offering&#8221;). As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the registration statement for the Follow-On Offering has not been declared effective by the SEC. The Follow-On Offering will only commence after the termination of the Offering. As of December 31, 2015, $1.34 billion in units remained available for sales pursuant to the Offering, including approximately $246.4 million in units available pursuant to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan.

Our CEO and President, Gloria Nelund, founded our Sponsor in 2008 after a thirty year career in the international asset management industry. 

To date, we have engaged, through our Advisor, eight investment managers in a sub-advisory capacity to source, evaluate, and monitor investments.

Investment Strategy 

The Company seeks to generate competitive financial returns and positive economic, social and environmental impact by providing financing to SMEs. Our investment objectives are to provide our unitholders current income, capital preservation, and modest capital appreciation. We intend to meet our investment objectives through: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Investing primarily in SME trade finance and term loans 

&#160;

&#183; 

A rigorous multi-level risk mitigation strategy at the portfolio level through &#8220;extreme&#8221; diversification, the sub-advisor level through rigorous due diligence and oversight, and the investment level through local market knowledge and credit expertise of our sub-advisors 

&#160;

&#183; 

Equity warrants and discounted trade receivables 

&#160;

The majority of our investments have been and will continue to be senior secured trade finance, senior secured loans and other collateralized loans or loan participations to SMEs with establ ished, profitable businesses in developing economies. With our sub-advisors, we provide growth capital financing generally ranging in size from $5-15 million per transaction for direct SME loans and $500,000 to $5 million for trade finance transactions. We seek to protect and grow investor capital by: (1) targeting countries with favorable economic growth and investor protections; (2) partnering with sub-advisors with significant experience in local markets; (3) focusing on creditworthy lending targets who have at least 3-year operating histories and demonstrated cash flows enabling loan repayment; (4) making primarily debt investments, backed by collateral and borrower guarantees; (5) employing sound due diligence and risk mitigation processes; and (6) moni toring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. 

Investments have been and will continue to be primarily credit facilities to developing economy SMEs, including trade finance and SME term loans, through TriLinc Advisors&#8217; team of professional sub-advisors with a local presence in the markets where they invest. We typically provide financing that is collateralized, has a short to medium-term maturity and is self-liquidating through the repayment of principal. By providing additional liquidity to growing small businesses, we believe we will support both economic growth and the expansion of the global middle class.

As of December 31, 2015, our largest investment represented approximately 9.3% of our net assets or 12.7% of our total portfolio. 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2014, we had one investment which represented more than 10% of our net assets. Our investment in a secured trade finance participation to Profert Ltd., an agricultural chemicals producer based in South Africa, amounted to approximately $8,202,100 or 13.2% of our net assets. 

Measuring Impact 

We measure and expect to regularly provide accounting of economic, social and/or environmental impact achieved through our investments. The Company&#8217;s impact measurement system is utilized with investments to evaluate the progress of borrower companies toward their impact objectives during the life of the investment. The system leverages technology that has been specifically developed for tracking and analyzing impact and includes full integration of the Global Impact Investing Network&#8217;s Impact Reporting and Investment Standards (&#8220;IRIS&#8221;) metrics. Impact measurement is accomplished through the establishment of initial baseline measurements for both the Company core economic development metrics, as well as metrics associated with borrower companies&#8217; stated impact objectives. These baseline measurements will be compared against future measurements in order to track incremental progress. In addition to furthering the Company&#8217;s economic development impact objectives, we anticipate that our investments will have a positive effect on borrower companies&#8217; ability to make progress toward their stated impact objectives(s). 

On an annual basis, an updating assessment is completed. This includes collection of our core impact metrics and borrower company impact objective-specific metrics. Annual external assurance of impact metrics data will be completed by an independent, third party provider. In February 2015, we engaged Moss Adams LLP, with the approval of our Audit Committee, to perform an independent review of certain impact data which will be reported once the Company reaches a statistically significant sample of borrower companies that have been in our portfolio for at least one year.

Financing Strategy 

We may opt to supplement our equity capital and increase potential returns to our unitholders through the use of prudent levels of borrowings from either commercial financial institutions or DFIs. We may use debt when the available terms and conditions are favorable to long-term investing and well-aligned with our investment strategy and portfolio composition. In determining whether to borrow money, we will seek to optimize maturity, covenant packages and rate structures. Most importantly, the risks of borrowing within the context of our investment outlook and the impact on our investment portfolio will be extensively analyzed in making this determination. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no borrowings and no available sources of borrowings. If we are not able to obtain financings, our returns are expected to be lower than originally anticipated.

Hedging Activities 

Most of our investments are anticipated to continue to be denominated in U.S. dollars, but when exposed to foreign currencies, we will seek to hedge the exposure when prudent and cost-effective. These hedging activities may include the use of derivatives, swaps, or other financial products to hedge our interest rate or currency risk. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, all our investments were denominated in U.S. Dollars and, accordingly, we had not entered into any hedging transactions. 

&#160;

Operating Expense Responsibility Agreement 

The Company, Advisor and the Sponsor entered into an Amended and Restated Operating Expense Responsibility Agreement effective as of June 11, 2013 and covering expenses through December 31, 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Operating Expense Responsibility Agreement, the Sponsor has paid expenses on behalf of the Company through December 31, 2015 and will additionally pay the accrued operating expenses of the Company as of December 31, 2015 on behalf of the Company. Such expenses will not be reimbursable to the Sponsor until the Company has raised $200 million of gross proceeds, provided that any such reimbursement during the period of the Offering will not cause the Company&#8217;s net asset value per unit to fall below the prior quarter&#8217;s net asset value per unit, and therefore have not been recorded as expenses of the Company as of December 31, 2015. Such expenses will be expensed and payable by the Company in the period, if and when they become reimbursable. As of December 31, 2015, the Sponsor has agreed to pay a cumulative total of approximately $7.5 million of operating expenses. 

Investment Advisory Agreements and Fees 

We pay TriLinc Advisors an asset management fee and an incentive fee for its services under the Advisory Agreement. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company incurred $2,006,532 and $794,737, respectively in management fees and $1,576,895 and $544,147, respectively in incentive fees to our Advisor. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our Sponsor made an expenses support payment to the Company in the aggregate amount of $2,136,629 and $792,968, respectively, under the Amended and Restated Operating Expense Responsibility Agreement which were comprised of management fees of $559,734 and $248,821, respectively, and incentive fees of $1,576,895 and $544,147, respectively. 

Asset Management Fee 

The asset management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 2.00% of our gross assets payable quarterly in arrears. For purposes of calculating the asset management fee, the term &#8220;gross assets&#8221; means the total net fair value of the Company&#8217;s assets at the end of the quarter, other than intangibles and after the deduction of associated allowance and reserves, as determined by the Advisor in its sole discretion. 

Incentive Fee 

The incentive fee is comprised of two parts: (i) a subordinated incentive fee on income and (ii) an incentive fee on capital gains. Each part of the incentive fee is outlined below. 

The subordinated incentive fee on income is earned on pre-incentive fee net investment income and is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar quarter during which the Advisory Agreement is in effect. If the Advisory Agreement is terminated, the fee will also become payable as of the effective date of the termination. 

The subordinated incentive fee on income is subject to a quarterly preferred return to investors, expressed as a rate of return on net assets at the beginning of the most recently completed calendar quarter, of 1.50% (6.0% annualized), subject to a &#8220;catch up&#8221; feature. The subordinated incentive fee on income for each quarter is calculated as follows: 

No incentive fee is earned by the Advisor in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the preferred return rate of 1.50%, or the preferred return. 

100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the quarterly preferred return, but is less than or equal to 1.875% (7.5% annualized) on our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, in any quarter, is payable to the Advisor. We refer to this portion of our subordinated incentive fee on income as the catch up. It is intended to provide an incentive fee of 20% on all of our pre-incentive fee net investment income when our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 1.875% on our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter in any quarter. 

For any quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 1.875% on our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, the subordinated incentive fee on income equals 20% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, because the preferred return and catch up will have been achieved. 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income is defined as interest income, dividend income and any other income accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter, including the asset management fee and operating expenses reimbursed to the Advisor. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 

&#160;

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the quarterly subordinated incentive fee on income: 

Quarterly Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income 

(expressed as a percentage of net assets) 

Percentage of pre-incentive fee net investment income 

allocated to quarterly incentive fee 

The incentive fee on capital gains is earned on investments sold or matured and shall be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year during which the Advisory Agreement is in effect. In the case the Advisory Agreement is terminated, the fee will also become payable as of the effective date of such termination. The fee will equal 20% of our realized capital gains, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains. Incentive fee on capital gains is equal to our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis. 

Because of the structure of the subordinated incentive fee on income and the incentive fee on capital gains, it is possible that we may pay such fees in a quarter where we incur a net loss. For example, if we receive pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the 1.75% on our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter for a quarter, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a net loss in the quarter due to a realized or unrealized capital loss. Our Advisor will not be under any obligation to reimburse us for any part of the incentive fee it receives that is based on prior period accrued income that we never receive as a result of a subsequent decline in the value of our portfolio. 

The fees that are payable under the Advisory Agreement for any partial period are appropriately prorated. The fees are calculated using a detailed policy and procedure approved by our Advisor and our board of managers, including a majority of the independent managers, and such policy and procedure is consistent with the description of the calculation of the fees set forth above. 

Our Advisor may elect to defer or waive all or a portion of the fees that would otherwise be paid to it in its sole discretion. Any portion of a fee not taken as to any month, quarter or year will be deferred without interest and may be taken in any such other month prior to the occurrence of a liquidity event as our Advisor may determine in its sole discretion. 

Emerging Growth Company 

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Although these exemptions will be available to us, they will not have a material impact on our public reporting and disclosure. We are deemed a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221; under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, and as a smaller reporting company, we are permanently exempt from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, because we have no employees, we do not have any executive compensation or golden parachute payments to report in our periodic reports and proxy statements. 

We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier. We will remain an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; under the Exchange Act. 

&#160;

Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complyin g with new or revised accounting standards. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates. 

Investment Company Act Considerations 

We have conducted and intend to continue to conduct our operations so that we and our subsidiaries will qualify for an exemption under, or otherwise will not be required to register as an investment company under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which we refer to as the Investment Company Act. 

Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer&#8217;s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40% test. Excluded from the term &#8220;investment securities,&#8221; among other things, are U.S. Government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. 

We conduct our business primarily through our direct and indirect wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries, including foreign subsidiaries, which were established to carry out specific activities. Although we reserve the right to modify our business methods at any time, the focus of our business involves providing loans and other financing of the nature described in this Form 10-K. We conduct our operations so that they comply with the limit imposed by the 40% test and we do not hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, or actually engaged, in the business of investing in securities. Therefore, we expect that we will not be subject to registration or regulation as an investment company of any kind (including, without limitation, a face-amount certificate company, unit investment trust, open-end or closed-end company or a management company electing to be treated as a business development company) under the Investment Company Act. The securities issued to us by our wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries, which subsidiaries will be neither investment companies nor companies exempt under Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, will not be investment securities for the purpose of this 40% test. 

One or more of our subsidiaries may seek to qualify for an exception or exemption from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act pursuant to other provisions of the Investment Company Act, such as Sections 3(c)(5)(A) which is available for entities &#8220;primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable, and other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise, insurance and services&#8221; and Section 3(c)(5)(B) which is available for entities &#8220;primarily engaged in the business of making loans to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of, and to prospective purchasers of, specified merchandise, insurance and services.&#8221; Each of these exemptions generally requires that at least 55% of such subsidiary&#8217;s assets be invested in eligible loans and receivables. To qualify for either of the foregoing exemptions, the subsidiary would be required to comply with interpretations issued by the staff of the SEC that govern the respective activities. 

We monitor our holdings and those of our subsidiaries to ensure continuing and ongoing compliance with these and/or other applicable tests, and we are responsible for making the determinations and calculations required to confirm our compliance with tests. If the SEC does not agree with our determinations, we may be required to adjust our activities and/or those of our subsidiaries. 

Qualification for these or other exceptions or exemptions could affect our ability to originate, participate in or hold fixed-income assets, or could require us to dispose of investments that we might prefer to retain in order to remain qualified for such exemptions. Changes in current policies by the SEC and its staff could also require that we alter our business activities for this purpose. For a discussion of certain risks associated with the Investment Company Act, please see &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Competition 

We compete with a large number of commercial banks, non-bank financial institutions, private equity funds, leveraged buyout and venture capital funds, investment banks and other equity and non-equity based investment funds. Many of our potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, certain of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships and build their market shares. 

&#160;

Concentration of credit risk 

At December 31, 2015, our portfolio of $101,028,104 (at fair value) included 25 companies and was comprised of $5,474,534 or 5.4% in senior secured term loans, $18,484,242 or 18.3% in senior secured term loans participations, and $77,069,328 or 76.3% in senior secured trade finance participations. Our largest loan by value was $12,862,666 or 12.7% of our total portfolio. Our 5 largest loans by value comprised 46.9% of our portfolio at December 31, 2015. Participation in loans represented 94.6% of our portfolio at December 31, 2015. 

Employees 

We have no employees. Pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor assumes principal responsibility for managing our affairs and we compensate the Advisor for these services.
