 Item 1. Business 

Company Background 

We are a leading global provider of software product engineering, technology consulting and digital expertise to clients located around the world, primarily in North America, Europe, Asia and the CIS region. With a strong focus on innovative and scalable software solutions, and a continually evolving mix of advanced capabilities, we leverage industry standard and custom developed technology, tools and platforms to deliver results for the most complex business challenges. We focus on building long-term partnerships with clients in industries such as software and high technology, financial services, media and entertainment, travel and hospitality, retail, energy, life sciences, healthcare, telecommunications, and government. 

Since our inception in 1993, we have focused on software product development services for major independent software vendors (ISVs) and technology companies and refined this core competency through ongoing multi-year engagements. These companies produce advanced technology products that demand sophisticated software engineering talent, tools, methodologies and infrastructure. As a result, we have developed a culture of innovation, technology leadership and process excellence, which helps us maintain a strong reputation for technical proficiency and high-quality project delivery. 

&#32;Our work with global leaders in enterprise software platforms and emerging technology companies exposes us to strategic business challenges in various industries, allowing us to develop vertical-specific domain expertise. Unlike custom application development tailored to specific business requirements, ISVs&#8217; software products must be designed with a higher level of product configurability and operational performance to address the needs of a diverse set of end-users operating in a variety of deployment environments. This in-depth understanding of how vertically-oriented ISVs and technology companies solve their clients&#8217; challenges allows us to focus and grow our business in multiple industry verticals, predominantly Financial Services, Media and Entertainment, and Travel and Consumer. 

Our historical core competency is full lifecycle software development and product engineering services including design and prototyping, product development and testing, component design and integration, product deployment, performance tuning, porting and cross-platform migration. This experience created a foundation for the evolution of our other offerings, which include advanced technology software solutions, intelligent enterprise services and digital engagement. 

Our strategic acquisitions allowed us to further expand our global footprint and service offering portfolio. Our 2014 acquisitions of Netsoft Holdings, LLC, Joint Technology Development Limited, GGA Software Services, LLC and Great Fridays Ltd. expanded our capabilities in the healthcare, financial services and digital design areas. Our 2015 acquisitions of NavigationArts, Inc and Alliance Consulting Global Holdings, Inc. enhanced our abilities in digital strategy, consulting and test automation, increasing our reach in many of our existing verticals as well as establishing our presence in India. We expect these strategic acquisitions will enable us to offer a broader range of services to our clients from a wider variety of locations.

Clients 

Our clients primarily consist of Forbes Global 2000 corporations located in North America, Europe, Asia and the CIS. We maintain a geographically diverse client base with 53.1% &#32;of our 2015 &#32;revenues from clients located in North America, 38.6% &#32;from clients in Europe, 4.7% &#32;from clients in the CIS and 2.6% &#32;from our clients in APAC. We typically enter into master services agreements with our clients, which provide a framework for services that is then supplemented by statements of work, which specify the particulars of each individual engagement, including the services to be performed, pricing terms and performance criteria. 

Our focus on delivering quality to our clients is reflected by an average of 95.1% &#32;and 84.3% &#32;of our revenues in 2015 &#32;coming from clients that had used our services for at least one and two years, respectively. In addition, we have significantly grown the size of existing accounts as majority of our top client mix remains consistent over the years. The annual revenue from our top five clients increased from $65.9 million in 2010 to $298.1 million &#32;in 2015 and the annual revenue from our top ten clients increased from $94.5 million in 2010 to $400.3 million &#32;in 2015. 

During 2015 &#32;and 2014 , one &#32;customer, UBS AG , accounted for over 10% of our revenues. No customer accounted for over 10% of our revenues in 2013 .

Revenues by client location above differ from our segment information. Our operations consist of four reportable segments: North America, Europe, Russia and Other. This determination is based on the unique business practices and market specifics of each region and that each region engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses. Our reportable segments are based on managerial responsibility for a particular client. Because managerial responsibility for a particular client relationship generally correlates with the client&#8217;s geographic location, there is a high degree of similarity between client locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments. In some specific cases, however, managerial responsibility for a particular client is assigned to a management team in another region, usually based on the strength of the relationship between client executives and particular members of our senior management team. In such a case, the client&#8217;s activity would be reported through the management team&#8217;s reportable segment. Particularly, our acquired clients in the APAC region are reported as part of the Europe segment based on the managerial responsibility for those clients. The following table presents the percentage of our revenues by reportable segment: &#160;

Sales and Marketing 

Our sales and marketing efforts support our business strategy to increase our revenues from new and existing clients through our senior management, sales and business development staff, account managers, and technical specialists. We maintain a dedicated sales force and a marketing team, which coordinates corporate-level branding efforts such as sponsorship of programming competitions to participation in and hosting of industry conferences and events. 

Given our focus on providing technical solutions to our clients&#8217; complex challenges, our IT professionals play an integral role in engaging with clients on potential business opportunities. Our account managers maintain direct client relationships and are tasked with identifying new business opportunities and responding to requests-for-proposals, or RFPs. Account managers typically engage technical and other specialists when pursuing opportunities. This sales model has been effective in promoting repeated business and growth from within our existing client base. 

In addition to effective client management, we believe that our reputation as a premium provider of software engineering solutions and information technology services drives additional business from inbound requests, referrals and RFPs. We enjoy published recognition from third-party industry observers, such as Forrester Research, Forbes Research, Everest Group, Zinnov, CIO Magazine, Information Week, and Software Magazine. 

Human Capital 

Attracting and retaining employees is a key factor in our ability to grow our revenues and meet our clients&#8217; needs. We have dedicated full-time employees that oversee all aspects of our human capital management process. We effectively plan our short-term and long-term recruitment needs and deploy the necessary personnel and processes to optimize utilization and to quickly satisfy the demands of our clients. As our business grows, we also focus on hiring and retaining individuals with appropriate skills to fill our executive, finance, legal, HR and other key management positions. 

At December 31, &#32; 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we had a total of 18,354 , 14,109 &#32;and 11,056 &#32;employees, respectively. Of these employees, as of December 31, &#32; 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, 16,078 , 11,824 &#32;and 9,340 &#32;were revenue generating IT professionals. 

In our competitive industry, the ability to hire and retain highly-skilled information technology professionals is critical to our success. We believe the quality of our employees serves as a key point of differentiation in how we deliver a superior value proposition to our clients. To attract, retain and motivate our IT professionals, we offer a challenging work environment, ongoing skills development initiatives, attractive career advancement and promotion opportunities thus providing an environment and culture that rewards entrepreneurial initiative and performance. 

Historically, we have developed our base of IT professionals by hiring highly-qualified, experienced IT professionals from the CIS and CEE region and by recruiting students from leading universities there. The quality and academic prestige of the CIS and CEE educational system is renowned worldwide. We have strong relationships with the leading institutions in these geographies, such as the Belarusian State University, Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics, the Saint Petersburg State University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics, the Moscow State University, the Moscow Institute of Physics &#38; Technology, the Moscow State University of Instrument Engineering and Computer Sciences and the National Technical University of Ukraine. The participants from these universities are frequent and consistent winners in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (&#8220;ICPC&#8221;), the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in 

the world. In the 2015 ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, the two top winning spots were awarded to the CIS schools and a highly regarded Belarusian university finished in the top 15. 

We have established EPAM delivery centers near many of these university campuses. Our ongoing involvement with these universities includes supporting EPAM-branded research labs, developing training courses, providing teaching equipment, actively supporting curriculum development and engaging students to identify their talents and interests. Our relationships with these technical institutions provide us access to a highly-qualified talent pool of programmers, and allow us to consistently attract highly-skilled students from these institutions. We also conduct lateral hiring through a dedicated IT professional talent acquisition team whose objective is to locate and attract qualified and experienced IT professionals within the region and other EPAM locations. 

We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees and our employees have not entered into any collective bargaining agreements or engaged in any labor disputes. 

Our Delivery Model 

We have delivery centers located in Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, Armenia, Poland, China, Mexico, Austria, Czech Republic and India. We have client management locations in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Netherlands, Russia, Kazakhstan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia. We believe the development of a robust global delivery model creates a key competitive advantage, enabling us to better understand and meet our clients&#8217; diverse needs and provide a compelling value proposition. We continuously grow our delivery platform both organically and through acquired delivery centers and client management locations. Our total headcount of revenue generating personnel was 16,078 &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . 

Our primary delivery centers are located in Belarus, where we have 5,207 &#32;IT professionals as of December 31, 2015 . The majority of these IT professionals are located in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, which is well-positioned to serve as a prime IT outsourcing destination given its strong industrial base, good educational infrastructure and legacy as the center of computer science for the former Soviet Union. Furthermore, the IT industry in Belarus has been strongly supported by the government, which has taken steps to encourage investment in the IT sector through long-term tax incentives. 

Our delivery centers in Ukraine have 3,734 &#32;IT professionals as of December 31, 2015 . Our delivery centers in Russia have 2,235 &#32;IT professionals as of December 31, 2015 . Our locations in Ukraine and Russia offer many of the same benefits as Belarus, including educational infrastructure, availability of qualified software engineers and government support of the IT industry. We believe our locations in Ukraine and Russia, along with our delivery centers in Belarus, offer a strong and diversified delivery platform across Europe. Our business has not been materially affected by the political and economic uncertainty in Russian or Ukraine to date. 

Our other significant delivery centers are in the United States with 1,016 &#32;IT professionals, Hungary with 1,151 &#32;IT professionals and India with 1,031 &#32;IT professionals as of December 31, 2015 . These delivery centers are located strategically to serve clients in North America, Europe and Asia. The delivery center in India has been established through our business combination with Alliance Consulting Global Holdings, Inc. 

Training and Development 

We dedicate significant resources to the training and development of our IT professionals. We believe in the importance of supporting educational initiatives and we sponsor employees&#8217; participation in internal and external training and certifications. Furthermore, we actively pursue partner engagements with technical institutions in CEE. 

We provide training, continuing education and career development programs for both entry-level and experienced IT professionals. Entry-level IT professionals undergo a rigorous training program that consists of approximately three to six months of classroom training, as well as numerous hours of hands-on training through actual engagements. This comprehensive program results in employees who are highly proficient and possess deep technical expertise that enables them to immediately serve our clients&#8217; needs. For our mid-level and senior IT professionals, we offer continuing education programs aimed at helping them advance in their careers. We also provide mentoring opportunities, management and soft skills training, intensive workshops and management and technical advancement programs. We are committed to systematically identifying and nurturing the development of middle and senior management through formal leadership training, evaluation, development and promotion. 

Quality and Process Management 

Over the years we have invested significant resources into developing a proprietary suite of internal applications and tools to manage all aspects of our delivery process. These applications and tools are effective in reducing costs and security risks, while providing control and visibility across all project lifecycle stages both internally and to our clients. In addition, these applications, tools, methodologies and infrastructure allow us to seamlessly deliver services and solutions to global clients, further strengthening our relationships with them. 

Our proprietary ISO 9001:2008 and CMMI-certified Quality Management System has been documented, implemented and maintained to ensure the timely delivery of software development services to our clients. We have also developed sophisticated project management techniques facilitated through our Project Management Center, a web-based collaborative environment for software development, which we consider critical to meeting or exceeding the service levels required by our clients. 

Our Quality Management System ensures that we provide timely delivery of software development services to enhance client satisfaction by enabling: 

&#8226; 

objective valuation of the performed process, work products and services against the client&#8217;s process descriptions, standards and procedures; 

&#8226; 

identification, documentation and timely resolution of noncompliance issues; 

&#8226; 

feedback to the client&#8217;s project staff and managers on the results of quality assurance activities; 

&#8226; 

monitoring and improvement of the software development process to ensure adopted standards and procedures are implemented and flaws are detected and resolved in a timely manner; and 

&#8226; 

execution of planned and systematic problem prevention activities. 

Our proprietary Project Management Center supports our software development delivery model. Our Project Management Center is effective in reducing risks and providing control and visibility across all project lifecycle stages based on the following features: 

&#8226; 

multi-site, multi-project capabilities; 

&#8226; 

activity-based software development lifecycle, which fully tracks the software development activities through the project documentation; 

&#8226; 

project, role-based access control, which can be available to us, clients and third parties; 

&#8226; 

fully configurable workflow engine with built-in notification and messaging; 

&#8226; 

extensive reporting capabilities and tracking of key performance indicators; and 

&#8226; 

integration with Microsoft Project and Outlook. 

The transparency and visibility into software development project deliverables, resource management, team messaging and project-related documents and files provided by our Project Management Center promotes collaboration and strengthens our relationships with our clients. Improved traceability enables significant time savings and cost reductions for business users and IT management during change management for the software development lifecycle. The combination of our Project Management Center with our other proprietary internal applications enhances our offering by reducing errors, increasing quality, effectiveness and oversight, and improving maintenance time. 

Based on our analysis of publicly available information of IT services providers, we are the only ISAE 3402 Type 2 certified IT services provider with multiple delivery centers in CEE. This certification is a widely recognized auditing standard developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, or AICPA, and it serves as additional assurance to our clients regarding the control environment and the security of their sensitive data. Furthermore, this is an important certification for firms in data and information-intensive industries, as well as any organization that is subject to the internal controls certification requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our ISAE 3402 Type 2 certification, in addition to our multiple ISO/IEC 27001:2005 and ISO 9001:2008 attestations, underscores our focus on establishing stringent security standards and internal controls. 

Competition 

The markets in which we compete are changing rapidly and we face competition from both global technology solutions providers as well as those based primarily in specific geographies with lower cost labor such as CEE, India and China. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include technical expertise and industry knowledge, end-to-end solution offerings, reputation and track record for high-quality and on-time delivery of work, effective employee recruiting, training and retention, responsiveness to clients&#8217; business needs, scale, financial stability and price. 

We face competition primarily from: 

&#8226; 

India-based technology outsourcing IT services providers, such as Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH), GlobalLogic, HCL Technologies, Infosys Technologies (NASDAQ:INFY), Mindtree, Symphony Technology Group, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro (NASDAQ:WIT); 

&#8226; 

Local CEE technology outsourcing IT services providers such as Luxoft Holding, Inc. (NYSE:LXFT); 

&#8226; 

Large global consulting and outsourcing firms, such as Accenture, Atos Origin, Capgemini, CSC and IBM; 

&#8226; 

China-based technology outsourcing IT services providers such as Camelot Information Services, and Pactera; and 

&#8226; 

In-house IT departments of our clients and potential clients. 

We believe that our focus on complex software product development solutions, our technical employee base, and the development and continuous improvement in process methodologies, applications and tools position us well to compete 

effectively in the future. Our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing or technical resources; may be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in client demands; may be able to devote greater resources towards the development, promotion and sale of their services than we can; and may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of our clients. 

Intellectual Property 

Protecting our intellectual property rights is critical to our business. We have invested, and will continue to invest, in research and development to enhance our domain knowledge and create complex, specialized solutions for our clients. We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. We require our employees, vendors and independent contractors to enter into written agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us, which assign to us all intellectual property and work product made, developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment with us. These agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us remains confidential. 

We also enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our clients. These customary agreements cover our use of the clients&#8217; software systems and platforms as our clients usually own the intellectual property in the products we develop for them. Furthermore, we usually grant a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive, transferable and non-revocable license to our clients to use our preexisting intellectual property, but only to the extent necessary in order to use the software or systems we developed for them.
