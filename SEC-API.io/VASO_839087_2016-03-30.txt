General Overview

Vasomedical, Inc. principally operates in three distinct business segments in the healthcare equipment and information technology industries. We manage and evaluate our operations, and report our financial results, through these three business segments.

&#183;

IT segment, operating through a wholly-owned subsidiary VasoTechnology, Inc., primarily focuses on healthcare IT and managed network technology services;

&#183;

Professional sales service segment (formerly the sales representation segment), operating through a wholly-owned subsidiary Vaso Diagnostics, Inc. d/b/a VasoHealthcare, primarily focuses on the sale of healthcare capital equipment for large OEMs into the health provider middle market; and

&#183;

Equipment segment, operating through wholly-owned subsidiaries Vasomedical Global Corp. and Vasomedical Solutions, Inc., primarily focuses on the design, manufacture, sale and service of proprietary medical devices.

VasoTechnology

VasoTechnology, Inc. &#160; was formed in May 2015, at the time the Company acquired all of the assets of NetWolves, LLC and its affiliates, including the membership interests in NetWolves Network Services LLC (collectively, "NetWolves") , to address a major issue facing the healthcare IT industry. It currently consists of a managed network and security service division and a healthcare IT application VAR (value added reseller) division. Its current offering includes:

&#183;

Managed diagnostic imaging applications (national channel partner of GEHC IT).

&#183;

Managed network infrastructure (routers, switches and other core equipment).

&#183;

Managed network transport (FCC licensed carrier reselling 175+ facility partners).

&#183;

Managed security services (IBM's first security white label partner).

VasoTechnology uses a combination of proprietary technology, methodology and best-in-class third-party applications to deliver its value proposition.

&#160;

VasoHealthcare

VasoHealthcare commenced operations in 2010, in conjunction with the Company's execution of its exclusive sales representation agreement with General Electric Healthcare ("GEHC"), which is the healthcare business division of the General Electric Company ("GE"), to exploit the sale of certain healthcare capital equipment in the health provider middle market. Sales of GEHC equipment by the Company have grown significantly since then.

VasoHealthcare's current offering consists of:

&#183;

GEHC diagnostic imaging capital equipment.

&#183;

GEHC service agreements.

&#183;

GEHC and third party financial services.

VasoHealthcare has built a team of approximately 90 highly experienced sales professionals who utilize highly focused sales management and analytic tools to manage the complete sales process and to increase market penetration.

Vasomedical Global and Vasomedical Solutions

Vasomedical Global was formed in 2011 to combine and coordinate the various design, development manufacturing, and sales operations of medical devices acquired by the Company. These devices primarily consist of cardiovascular diagnostic and therapeutic systems. Its current offering consists of:

&#183;

Biox&#8482; series Holter monitors and ambulatory blood pressure recorders .

&#183;

ARCS&#8482; series analysis, reporting and communication software for physiological signals such as ECG and blood pressure.

&#183;

MobiCare&#8482; multi-parameter wireless vital-sign monitoring system.

&#183;

EECP &#174; therapy systems, used for non-invasive, outpatient treatment for ischemic heart disease.

This segment uses its extensive cardiovascular device knowledge coupled with its significant engineering resources to cost effectively create and market its proprietary technology. It works with a global distribution network of channel partners, as well as a global joint venture arrangement, to sell its products.

Historical Background

Vasomedical, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in July 1987. For most of its history, the Company was a single-product company designing, manufacturing, marketing and servicing its proprietary Enhanced External Counterpulsaion, or EECP &#174; , therapy systems, mainly for the treatment of angina. In 2010 it began to diversify its business operations.

In May 2010, the Company launched its Professional Sales Service business through a wholly-owned subsidiary Vaso Diagnostics, Inc. d/b/a VasoHealthcare, which was appointed the exclusive representative for the sale of select General Electric Company ("GE") diagnostic imaging equipment to specific market segments in the 48 contiguous states of the United States and the District of Columbia. The original agreement ("GEHC Agreement") was for three years ending June 30, 2013; in 2012 it was extended to June 30, 2015 and again in 2014 to December 31, 2018.

In June 2014, the Company began its IT segment business by concluding the Value Added Reseller Agreement ("VAR Agreement") with GEHC to become a national value added reseller of GE Healthcare IT's Radiology PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) software solutions and related services, including implementation, management and support. This multiyear VAR Agreement focuses primarily on existing customer segments currently served by VasoHealthcare on behalf of GEHC. A new wholly owned subsidiary, VasoHealthcare IT Corp. ("VHC IT"), was formed to conduct the healthcare IT business. 

&#160;

In May 2015, the Company further expanded its IT segment business by acquiring all of the assets of NetWolves, LLC and its affiliates, including the membership interests in NetWolves Network Services LLC (collectively, "NetWolves"), pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement. NetWolves designs and delivers efficient and cost-effective multi-network and multi-technology solutions as a managed network provider, and provides a complete single-source solution that includes design, network redundancy, application device management, real-time network monitoring, reporting and support systems as a comprehensive solution. The Company believes there are significant operational synergies between NetWolves' capabilities and VasoHealthcare IT's requirements under its VAR Agreement with GEHC, and is engaged in expanding NetWolves' existing services to the healthcare IT market.

The Company's Equipment business also has been significantly expanded from the original EECP &#174; -only operations. In September 2011, the Company acquired FGE, a British Virgin Islands company, which owns or controls two Chinese operating companies - Life Enhancement Technology Ltd. ("LET") based in Foshan, China, and Biox Instruments Co. Ltd. ("Biox") based in Wuxi, China, respectively - to expand its technical and manufacturing capabilities and to enhance its distribution network, technology, and product portfolio. Biox is a variable interest entity controlled by FGE through certain contracts and an option to acquire all the shares of Biox. In August 2014, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Genwell Instruments Co. Ltd. ("Genwell"), located in Wuxi, China, through its wholly owned subsidiary Wuxi Gentone Instruments Co. Ltd. ("Gentone"). Genwell was formed in China in 2010 with the assistance of a government grant to develop the MobiCare&#8482; wireless multi-parameter patient monitoring system and holds intellectual property rights for this system. As a result, the Company has now expanded its equipment products portfolio to include Biox&#8482; series ambulatory patient monitoring systems, and the MobiCare&#8482; patient monitoring device.

In April 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with Chongqing PSK-Health Sci-Tech Development Co., Ltd. ("PSK") of Chongqing, China, the leading manufacturer of external counter pulsation, or ECP, therapy systems in China, to form a joint venture company, VSK Medical Limited ("VSK"), a Cayman Islands company, for the global marketing, sale and advancement of ECP therapy technology. The Company owns 49.9% of VSK, which commenced operations in January 2015.

&#160;

Management

The Company currently bases its headquarters in Plainview, Long Island, NY and maintains an office in Manhattan, NY. Reporting to the Board of Directors, corporate officers of the Company include the President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), Chief Operating Officer ("COO"), and Vice President of Finance and Treasurer.

The management of our IT segment including its sales and marketing efforts is led by the COO of the Company, who is also the President of NetWolves, which is based in Tampa, FL. Our VasoHealthcare IT VAR business is led by the General Manager of the business unit and supported by several software solution sales and implementation specialists. The unit works with our VasoHealthcare diagnostic imaging equipment sales team to generate leads and potential clients for the software solutions products and works with NetWolves sales and technical teams for comprehensive IT product and service offerings.

In the professional sales services segment, we sell GEHC diagnostic imaging products to our assigned market through a nationwide team of sales employees led by several regional managers who report to the Vice President of National Sales as well as to the President of VasoHealthcare. The operation is supported by in-house administrative, analytic and other support staff, as well as applicable GEHC employees.

The equipment segment is directly supervised by the CEO of the Company. Sales and marketing efforts in the domestic market are led by a vice president of national sales and service at Vasomedical Solutions, and the managers of our China subsidiaries are in charge of the production of all our proprietary products and marketing and sales in the international markets. We historically have marketed our EECP &#174; systems internationally through distributors in various countries throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America. This distribution structure has been realigned with our partner's via the joint venture VSK Medical. We sell our Biox&#8482; series ambulatory monitoring systems and related products in China by a group of sales managers as well as through distributors covering various regions of China and other international geographies.

&#160;

Competition

In the U.S. diagnostic imaging market, our main competitors are Siemens, Philips, Toshiba, and Hologic. Key competitive factors in the market include price, quality, finance availability, delivery speed, service and support, innovation, distribution network, breadth of product and service offerings and brand name recognition. GEHC is a leading competitor in this market.

In the IT segment, our primary competitors in the healthcare IT VAR business are Agfa Healthcare, McKesson, Philips, Carestream Health and other independent software providers. Key competitive factors are brand recognition, quality, radiology workflow solutions, scalability and service and support capability. We are able to capitalize on the brand recognition of GEHC, a leader in healthcare software solutions. In the managed network services business our primary competition includes, but is not limited to, organizations whom have a presence in most of the major markets for the following products and services; network services, managed services, security services and healthcare applications. Several of those competitors are; Verizon, AT&#38;T, CenturyLink, IBM and Cisco Resellers, Siemens, Epic, small regional IT integrators and large company internal IT departments.

Though we believe that we are the industry leader of external counterpulsation technology, our competitors in our EECP &#174; business are Renew Group Pte. Ltd and Scottcare Cardiovascular Solutions in the United States, and internationally PSK-Health Sci-Tech Development Co., Ltd., with which we have formed a joint venture to co-market external counterpulsation products in the international market. 

In the ambulatory monitoring system business, there are numerous competitors of various size and strength. The Biox&#8482; series is among few from China with CE Mark certification, CFDA approval, US FDA clearances as well as Health Canada listing, which are among the most important qualifications to market and sell the products around the world.

Regulations on Medical Devices

&#160;

As a medical device manufacturer and marketer, we are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government regulatory agencies, including the U. S. FDA and similar foreign agencies. We are required to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards governing the development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, quality testing, labeling, promotion, import, export, and distribution of our medical devices.

Compliance with Regulations in the United States

The Company has received appropriate US FDA premarket notification (510(k)) clearance for all its products marketed and sold in the United States, including all EECP &#174; therapy systems and Biox&#8482; ambulatory monitoring systems and analysis and report software. We continue to seek US FDA clearance or approval for new products prior to their introduction to the US market.

We are subject to other US FDA regulations that apply prior to and after a product is commercially released. We also are subject to periodic and random inspections by the US FDA for compliance with the current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and Quality System Regulation. The US FDA also enforces post-marketing controls that include the requirement to submit medical device reports to the agency when a manufacturer becomes aware of information suggesting that any adverse events are related to its marketed products. The FDA relies on medical device reports to identify product problems and utilizes these reports to determine, among other things, whether it should exercise its enforcement powers. The FDA also may require post-market surveillance studies for specified devices.

We are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act's, or FDCA's, general controls, including establishment registration, device listing, and labeling requirements.

The advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC. The FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. Violations of the FTC Act, such as failure to have substantiation for product claims, would subject us to a variety of enforcement actions, including compulsory process, cease and desist orders and injunctions, which can require, among other things, limits on advertising, corrective advertising, consumer redress and restitution, as well as substantial fines or other penalties.

&#160;

&#160;

As a medical device sales channel partner and product reseller to healthcare facilities, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws.

Foreign Regulation

In most countries to which we seek to export our medical devices, a local regulatory clearance must be obtained. The regulatory review process varies from country to country and can be complex, costly, uncertain, and time-consuming. Vasomedical's medical devices, including EECP &#174; systems and Biox&#8482; series products, are all manufactured in accordance with ISO 13485, the international standard for medical devices. All our current medical devices have obtained necessary clearances or approvals prior to their release in the appropriate jurisdictions, including CE marking certification for European Union countries, China FDA (CFDA) approval for mainland China, Korean FDA (KFDA) approval for South Korea, Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria (ANVISA) approval for Brazil, and Health Canada license for Canada.

We are also subject to audits by organizations authorized by foreign countries to determine compliance with laws, regulations and standards that apply to the commercialization of our products in those markets. Examples include auditing by a European Union Notified Body organization (authorized by a member state's Competent Authority) to determine conformity with the Medical Device Directives (MDD) and by an organization authorized by the Canadian government to determine conformity with the Canadian Medical Devices Regulations (CMDR).

&#160;

Patient Privacy

Federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restrict the use and disclosure of that protected information. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published patient privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA privacy rule) and the regulation was finalized in October 2002. Currently, the HIPAA privacy rule affects us only indirectly in that patient data that we access, collect and analyze may include protected health information. Additionally, we have signed some Business Associate Agreements with Covered Entities that contractually bind us to protect private health information, consistent with the HIPAA privacy rule's requirements. We do not expect the costs and impact of the HIPAA privacy rule to be material to our business.

Regulations in the IT Business

As a reseller of telecommunication services and network solutions provider, our products and services are subject to federal, state and local regulations. These regulations govern, in part, our rates and the way we conduct our business, including the requirement to offer telecommunications services pursuant to nondiscriminatory rates, terms, and conditions, the obligation to safeguard the confidentiality of customer proprietary network information, as well as the obligation to maintain specialized records and file reports with the Federal Communications Commission and state regulatory authorities. While we believe we are in compliance with laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we do business, we must continue to monitor and assess our compliance.

&#160;

The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") exercises jurisdiction over services and regulates interstate and international communications in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S territories. As an independent U.S. government agency overseen by Congress, the commission is the United States' primary authority for communications laws, regulation and technological innovation.

&#160;

We maintain Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity in all 50 states which enable us to provide services within each state. We are therefore subject to regulation from the Public Utility Commissions in each state.

&#160;

&#160;

Strategic Plan and Objectives

Our short- and long-term plans for the growth of the Company and to increase stockholder value are:

&#183;

Continue to expand our product and service offerings as well as market penetration of our healthcare IT business.

&#183;

Expand our managed network services business into the healthcare market through our healthcare IT business and through the introduction of additional functionality to our existing capabilities.

&#183;

Build our brand name in the healthcare provision middle market with the goal of establishing our technology platform and managed services methodology as the standard for secure, efficient use of equipment &#160; and applications ecosystems.

&#183;

Maintain and improve business performance in our professional sales service segment by increasing market penetration of the GE Healthcare product modalities we represent, and possibly building new teams to represent other vendors.

&#183;

Maintain and grow our equipment business by continuing to align the cost structure with revenue growth and increasing our efforts to grow international sales of all our device offerings.

&#183;

Continue to seek partnership and acquisition opportunities.

The above-listed strategic objectives are forward-looking statements. We review, modify and change our strategic objectives from time to time based upon changing business conditions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our strategic objectives and, even if these results are achieved, risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. Financial resource availability may reduce our ability to achieve these strategic objectives. Please see the section of this Form 10-K entitled "Risk Factors" for a description of certain risks, among others that may cause our actual results to vary from the forward-looking statements.

Intellectual Properties

In addition to other methods of protecting our proprietary technology, know-how and show-how as well as trade secrets, we pursue a policy of seeking patent protection, both in the US and abroad, for our proprietary technologies including those in EECP &#174; , Biox&#8482; and MobiCare&#8482; products.

We own eleven US patents including eight utility patents and three design patents that expire at various times through 2023. We will from time to time file other patent applications regarding specific enhancements to the current EECP &#174; models, future generation products, and methods of treatment in the future. Moreover, trademarks have been registered for the names "EECP", "AngioNew", "Natural Bypass", "Vasomedical", "Vasomedical EECP", "VasoGlobal", "VasoSolutions", "VasoHealthcare".

Through our China-based subsidiaries, we own fourteen invention, utility and design patents that expire at various time through 2024, as well as twelve software copyright certificates in China related to ECG and blood pressure data analysis and reporting. We also have eight registered trademarks in China for our products.

Through our Netwolves subsidiary we hold a patent for Secure and Remote Monitoring Management ("SRM") and we hold trademarks "NetWolves", "SRM", and "Wolfpac".

There can be no assurance that our patents will not be violated or that any issued patents will provide protection that has commercial significance. As with any patented technology, litigation could be necessary to protect our patent position. Such litigation can be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 281 full-time persons, of which 17 are employed through our facility in Plainview, New York, 82 through VasoHealthcare, 10 through VasoHealthcare IT, 103 through our Netwolves operations, and 69 in our China operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that our employee relations are good.

&#160;

&#160;

The Company also uses several part-time employees and consultants from time to time for various purposes.

Manufacturing

The Company conducts its manufacturing activities primarily through LET and Biox facilities in China, while maintaining certain manufacturing capability in the Plainview, NY location to satisfy certain domestic and international needs for the EECP &#174; systems. LET manufactures EECP &#174; systems and Biox manufactures ambulatory monitoring devices and other medical devices.

All manufacturing operations are conducted under the cGMP requirements as set forth in the FDA Quality System Regulation as well as ISO 13485 standard, the international quality standard for medical device manufacturers. We are also certified to conform to full quality assurance system requirements of the EU Medical Device Directive and can apply CE marking to all of our current product models. Lastly, we are certified to comply with the requirements of the Canadian Medical Device Regulations (CMDR). All these regulations and standards subject us to inspections to verify compliance and require us to maintain documentation and controls for the manufacturing and quality activities.

We believe our manufacturing capacity and warehouse facility are adequate to meet the current and immediately foreseeable future demand for the production of our medical devices. We believe our suppliers of the other medical devices we distribute or represent are capable of meeting our demand for the foreseeable future.
