BUSINESS. 

&#160;

Overview

&#160;

Mitek is a global provider of mobile capture and identity verification software solutions for enterprises. We are currently serving more than 5,400 financial services organizations and leading brands across the globe. Our solutions are embedded in native mobile apps and mobile optimized websites to facilitate better mobile user experiences and compliant transactions.

&#160;

Mitek invented Mobile Deposit&#174; which is used today by millions of consumers in the U.S. and Canada for mobile check deposit. Following the success of Mobile Deposit&#174;, Mitek has introduced a multi-check capture solution that enables businesses to deposit multiple checks in one batch using a mobile device. 

&#160;

Mitek is also applying our mobile and imaging expertise to digital identity verification globally. Mitek&#8217;s image based identity verification product, Mobile Verify &#8482; , is empowering the digital transformation of companies operating in highly regulated markets by enabling them to identify with whom they are conducting business. Identity verification is mandatory to be in compliance with many governmental Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering regulatory requirements around the globe. 

&#160;

Our identity verification technology has been selected for use with digital/mobile on-boarding, fast money movement, and user re-authentication when irregular activity is suspected. While our solutions are primarily used in financial services (banks, credit unions, lenders, payments processers, card issuers, insurers, etc) we are also seeing adoption by telecommunications, healthcare, travel, retail, sharing economy companies and more.

&#160;

We market and sell our products and services worldwide through internal, direct sales teams located in the US and Europe as well as through channel partners. Our direct sales strategy concentrates on large financial services organizations and medium sized companies. Our partner sales strategy includes channel partners who are financial services technology providers. These partners integrate our products into their solutions to meet the needs of their customers. The majority of our revenue is derived from software licenses with an increasing percentage of revenue from software as a service (&#8220;SaaS&#8221;) contracts.

&#160;

Mitek is headquartered in San Diego, California, and has offices in Haarlem (the Netherlands) and London (United Kingdom). 

Product and Technology Overview

&#160;

Technology

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we had one operating segment: the development, sale, and service of our proprietary software solutions related to mobile image capture and identity verification.

&#160;

Our mobile technology solutions are provided in two parts: (i) a software development kit (SDK) for mobile capture and (ii) a software platform for image correction, detection, extraction and authentication. This proprietary technology effectively turns camera-equipped smartphones and tablets into mobile digital scanning devices that facilitate safe and compliant mobile onboarding and monetary transactions. 

&#160;

Our products and services process images of documents in many ways. These include quality analysis, image repair and optimization, document identification, the extraction of hand-printed and machine-printed text, and verification as to the validity of the document using both proprietary checks as well as verification of security features present on the document.

&#160;

&#160;

Products

&#160;

Mobile Fill&#8482;

Mobile Fill&#8482;, which includes our touch free auto capture experience, enables the camera to serve as a keyboard. Using Mobile Fill&#8482;, consumers can pre-fill forms with personal data by simply snapping a picture of their driver license, credit card, or other document. Organizations can use Mobile Fill&#8482; for a variety of purposes, including streamlining the process of opening a customer checking, savings or credit card account, paying a bill, activating a &#8220;switch and save&#8221; offer, and more. Mitek&#8217;s prime users for Mobile Fill include national and regional banks, credits unions, wireless telecom operators and insurance providers.

&#160;

The second generation of our Mobile Fill&#8482; product, Mobile Fill for Mobile Web&#8482;, enables consumers to use their camera as a keyboard right from the organization&#8217;s mobile website, eliminating the need to download an application. 

Mobile Fill &#8482; is integrated into native mobile apps and mobile websites. 

Mobile Verify&#8482;

&#160;

Mobile Verify&#8482; is an identity verification solution that can be integrated into mobile apps, mobile websites, and desktop applications. Mobile Verify combines our advanced auto capture experience with our computer vision technology to perform algorithmic-based tests that verify the authenticity of thousands of ID document types around the globe, including passports, driver's licenses and identity cards from nearly every nation. The key driver of digital identity verification is to meet stringent regulatory requirements mandated by governments and industry regulators globally for digital onboarding and money movement. 

&#160;

Mobile Docs&#8482;

&#160;

Mobile Docs &#8482; is a mobile document scanning solution. It enables consumers to take photos of documents resulting in scanner-quality images. Mobile Docs can be used to submit the trailing documents required for digital onboarding, lending and other use cases where additional documentation is required in a workflow. 

&#160;

Mobile Deposit&#174; (for retail banking) 

&#160;

Mitek invented Mobile Deposit &#174; to allow individuals and businesses to remotely deposit checks using their camera-equipped smartphone or tablet. 

&#160;

Mobile Deposit&#174; is utilized by the mobile banking apps of U.S. and Canadian retail banks. As of September 30, 2016, more than 5,400 financial institutions had signed agreements to deploy Mobile Deposit &#174; . It allows users to make deposits by photographing the front and back of a check and submitting the image electronically. 

&#160;

The Mobile Deposit&#174; process allows the consumer to take photographs of the front and back off a check and remotely deposit the check with their participating bank. Mitek also enables a better user experience by making available our proprietary advanced mobile auto capture process which can assist users in automatically capturing a usable image of a check by simply holding their mobile device over the check. We began selling Mobile Deposit&#174; in the second fiscal quarter of 2008. 

&#160;

We received our first patent issued for this product in August 2010. Of Mitek&#8217;s 27 patents, 9 are related to methods and systems used to deposit a check via a mobile device&#8217;s camera, and an additional 13 support our core image processing science.

&#160;

Commercial Mobile Deposit Capture&#8482; (for business banking) 

&#160;

Our Commercial Mobile Deposit Capture&#8482; product integrates the same core technology as Mobile Deposit&#174; with additional capabilities specific to small and medium size businesses. Additional capabilities include a mobile multi-check capture to help businesses eliminate the need for check scanners and trips to the ATM or bank branches.

&#160;

Of the 19 billion checks deposited in the U.S. per the 2013 Federal Reserve Payments Study , a majority were deposited by businesses. Many of the checks deposited by businesses are deposited in small batches and by businesses that are geographically dispersed. In the past, banks have attempted to alleviate some of the issues related to commercial deposits by providing costly, single purpose scanners to their business customers to allow them to scan their checks on site. Like many proprietary hardware solutions in the mobile era, the scanners are increasingly viewed as a costly annoyance by many businesses, plus they are not available at the point of service, which may occur away from the office, for instance when a delivery driver receives a check from a customer at the customer&#8217;s location.

&#160;

Our Commercial Mobile Deposit Capture solution makes the process of depositing multiple checks significantly easier by, for instance, enabling the user to capture multiple checks individually in one video session (powered by our MiSnap technology) and then providing capabilities to virtually edit, append information to, and &#8220;batch&#8221; the items into a single business deposit which can be deposited remotely from the mobile device. 

&#160;

Our technology processes images of documents in many ways. These include quality analysis, image repair, document identification and the extraction of hand-printed and machine-printed text. Our solutions can be deployed on any back office, industrial or desktop scanner, or on camera-equipped smartphones or tablets, to optimize and extract select data from any scanned or photographed identity document, check, bill or other financial document. Our capabilities include mobile document capture, image recognition, repair and optimization, dynamic data extraction and several document-speci fic capabilities, such as courtesy amount recognition, legal amount recognition, passport machine readable zones, and reading of barcodes. 

&#160;

Our proprietary, patented technology combines our patented core character recognition software with advanced mobile capture processing capabilities that transform a four-color photograph of a document into a digital image equivalent in size and resolution to a scanned document. This process overcomes several critical issues inherent in mobile photography. Documents captured by camera-equipped smartphones and tablets are exposed to variable lighting conditions and various angles and focal distances. Raw photos of documents taken by a camera-equipped smartphone or tablet may be of an unknown size and resolution. They are often geometrically distorted, skewed or warped. As a result, the &#8220;raw&#8221; mobile document image is virtually unusable without Mitek&#8217;s solution. Our technology uses advanced algorithms designed to identify and correct geometric and optical distortions, automatically correcting each mobile document image.

&#160;

&#160;

Sales and Marketing

&#160;

We market and sell our products and services worldwide through internal, direct sales teams located in the US and Europe as well as through channel partners. Our direct sales strategy concentrates on large financial services organizations and medium sized companies. Our partner sales strategy includes channel partners who are financial services technology providers. These partners integrate our products into their solutions to meet the needs of their customers. 

&#160;

We derive revenue predominately from the sale of licenses (to both our on premise and SaaS products) and transaction fees to use our Mobile Deposit&#174;, Commercial Mobile Deposit Capture &#8482; , Mobile Verify &#8482; , Mobile Fill &#8482; and Mobile Docs &#8482; products, and to a lesser extent by providing maintenance and professional services for the products we offer. The revenue we derive from the sale of such licenses is derived from both the sale to our channel partners of licenses to sell the applications we offer as well as the direct sale to customers of licenses.

&#160;

We have an internal marketing group that develops corporate and digital marketing strategies. The internal team executes these strategies with the help of external resources as needed to support both direct sales and channel partners&#8217; sales efforts.

&#160;

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we derived revenue of $6.3 million, or 18% of our total revenue, from one customer, compared to revenue of $6.3 million or 25% of our total revenue, from one customer in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we derived revenue of $5.7 million, or 30% of our total revenue from one customer.

&#160;

International revenues accounted for 15%, 5%, and 4% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Revenues from our products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.

&#160;

Intellectual Property

&#160;

Our success depends in large part upon our proprietary technology. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights primarily through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third party non-disclosure agreements and other measures. We believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product development, frequent product enhancements, name recognition, and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technological leadership position. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the U.S. or abroad will be adequate. We seek to protect our software, documentation, and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws, which afford only limited protection. Further, there can be no assurance that our patents will offer any protection or that they will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or we infringe on the intellectual property rights of a third party, our operating results could be adversely affected.

&#160;

As of September 30, 2016, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued us 27 patents and we have filed for 16 additional domestic and international patents. We have 19 registered trademarks and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks, as appropriate. We claim common law protection for, and may seek to register, other trademarks. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees.

&#160;

Market Opportunities, Challenges and Risks

&#160;

We believe that financial institutions and other companies see our patented solutions as a way to provide an enhanced mobile customer experience, and at the same time, meet regulatory requirements. The value of digital transformation to our customers is an increase in top line revenue and a reduction in the cost of sales and service.

&#160;

We believe digital transformation initiatives are in their infancy. We predict growth in both our Mobile Deposit&#174; and our ID products based on current trends of bank branch closure, more stringent regulations and ever increasing demand for mobile sales and service by millennials and mobile -first consumers. 

&#160;

Factors adversely affecting the pricing of, or demand for, our mobile solutions, such as competition from other products or technologies, any decline in the demand for mobile applications, or negative publicity or obsolescence of the software environments in which our products operate, could result in lower revenues or gross margins. Further, because substantially all of our revenues are from a few types of technology, our product concentration may make us especially vulnerable to market demand and competition from other technologies, which could reduce our revenues.

&#160;

The sales cycle for our software and services can be lengthy and the implementation cycles for our software and services by our channel partners and customers can also be lengthy, often a minimum of six months and sometimes longer for larger customers, and require significant investments. If implementation of our products by our channel partners and customers is delayed or otherwise not completed, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

&#160;

Revenues related to most of our on premise licenses for mobile products are required to be recognized up front upon satisfaction of all applicable revenue recognition criteria. Revenue related to our SaaS products is recognized ratably over the life of the contract or as transactions are used depending on the contract criteria. The recognition of future revenues from these licenses is dependent upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the term of our license agreements, the timing of implementation of our products by our channel partners and customers and the timing of any re-orders of additional licenses and/or license renewals by our channel partners and customers.

&#160;

During each of the last few years, sales of licenses to one or more channel partners have comprised a significant part of our revenue each year. This is attributable to the timing of renewals or purchases of licenses and does not represent a dependence on any single channel partner. If we were to lose a channel partner relationship, we do not believe such a loss would adversely affect our operations because either we or another channel partner could sell our products to the end-users that had purchased products from the channel partner we lost. However, in that case, we or another channel partner must establish a relationship with the end-users, which could take time to develop, if it develops at all.

&#160;

We have a growing number of competitors in the mobile capture and identity verification industry, many of which have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources. However, we believe our patented mobile capture and identity verification technology, our growing portfolio of products for the financial services industry and our market expertise gives us a distinct competitive advantage. To remain competitive, we must continue to offer products that are attractive to the consumer as well as being secure, accurate and convenient. To help us remain competitive, we intend to further strengthen our portfolio of products through research and development as well as partnering with other technology providers.

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

The market for our products and solutions is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change, and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. We face direct and indirect competition from a broad range of competitors who offer a variety of products and solutions to our current and potential customers. Our principal competition comes from: (i) customer-developed solutions; (ii) companies offering alternative methods of identity verification; and (iii) companies offering competing technologies capable of mobile remote deposit capture or authenticating identity documents and facial photo comparison.

&#160;

It is also possible that we will face competition from new industry participants or alternative technologies. Moreover, as the market for automated document processing, image recognition and authentication, check imaging and fraud detection software develops, a number of companies with significantly greater resources than we have could attempt to enter or increase their presence in our industry, either independently or by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors, or otherwise increase their focus on the industry. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our current and potential customers.

&#160;

Our products are compliant with Service-Oriented Architecture standards and compete, to various degrees, with products produced by a number of substantial competitors. Competition among product providers in this market generally focuses on price, accuracy, reliability and technical support. We believe our primary competitive advantages in this market are: (i) our mobile auto capture user experience used by millions of consumers; (ii) our patented science; (iii) scalability; and (iv) an architectural software design that allows our products to be more readily modified, improved with added functionality and configured for new products, thereby allowing our software to be easily upgraded.

&#160;

Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

&#160;

Research and Development

&#160;

We develop software products internally and also purchase or license rights to third-party intellectual property. We believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to maintain and improve our core technologies, enhance our existing products and develop new products that meet an expanding range of customer requirements.

&#160;

Internal research and development allows us to maintain closer technical control over our products and gives us the ability to determine which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented to ensure the proper functioning of our software products. We intend to expand our existing product offerings and introduce new mobile capture and identity verification capabilities that meet a broader set of needs of our customers. We intend to continue to support the major industry standard operating environments.

&#160;

Our research and development organization includes software engineers and scientists, many of whom have advanced degrees, as well as additional personnel in quality assurance and related disciplines. All of our scientists and software engineers are involved in product development. 

&#160;

The development team includes specialists in artificial intelligence, computer vision, software engineering, user interface design, product documentation and quality assurance. The team is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the performance, quality and utility of all of our products. In addition to research and development, our engineering staff provides customer technical support on an as-needed basis.

&#160;

Our research and development expenses for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $7.8 million, $5.6 million, and $6.0 million respectively. We expect research and development expenses during fiscal year 2017 to increase as compared with those incurred in fiscal year 2016 as we continue our new product research and development efforts.

&#160;

Employees and Labor Relations

&#160;

As of September 30, 2016, we had 117 employees, 81 in the U.S. and 36 in Europe (UK and The Netherlands), 104 of which are full time. Our total employee base consists of 57 sales and marketing and professional services employees, 41 research and development and support employees, and 19 employees in executive, finance, network administration and other capacities. In addition, we engaged various consultants in the areas of research and development, product development, finance and marketing during fiscal year 2016. We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are represented by a labor organization. Substantially all of our employees, other than certain of our executive officers and employees with customary employment arrangements within Europe, are at will employees, which means that each employee can terminate his or her relationship with us and we can terminate our relationship with him or her at any time. We offer industry competitive wages and benefits and are committed to maintaining a workplace environment that promotes employee productivity and satisfaction. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
