 Item 1. BUSINESS Our principal business is the exploration and development of our Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects (&#147;Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects&#148; or &#147;UKMP Projects&#148;) located in the Ambler mining district in Northwest Alaska, United States, comprising the (i) Arctic Project, which contains a high-grade polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulfide (&#147;VMS&#148;) deposit (&#147;Arctic Project&#148;); and (ii) Bornite Project, which contains a carbonate-hosted copper deposit (&#147;Bornite Project&#148;). Our goals include expanding mineral resources and advancing our projects through technical, engineering and feasibility studies so that production decisions can be made on those projects. We also own a 100% interest in the Titiribi gold-copper exploration project in Colombia.

(1) A branch of Sunward Resources Limited registered to do business in Colombia

Business Cycle 

Our business, at its current exploration phase, is cyclical. Exploration activities are conducted primarily during snow-free months in Alaska. The optimum field season at the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects is from late May to late September. The length of the snow-free season at the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects varies from about May through November at lower elevations and from July through September at higher elevations. 

NovaCopper&#146;s Strategy 

Our business strategy is focused on creating value for stakeholders through our ownership and advancement of the Arctic Project and exploration of the Bornite Project and through the pursuit of similarly attractive mining projects. We plan to:

&#149; 

advance the Arctic Project towards development with key activities including increased definition of the mineral resources, technical studies to support completion of a pre-feasibility or feasibility study, and the advancement of baseline environmental studies; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#149; 

advance exploration in the Ambler mining district and, in particular, at the Bornite Project, pursuant to the NANA Agreement (as more particularly described under &#147; History of NovaCopper &#150; Agreement with NANA Regional Corporation &#148;) through resource development and initial technical studies; and 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#149; 

pursue project level or corporate transactions that are value accretive. 

The Arctic Project PEA represents an early stage study and highlights certain opportunities for us to further expand upon. Prior to commencing production, further studies that demonstrate the economic viability of the Arctic Project must be completed including pre-feasibility or feasibility studies, all necessary permits must be obtained, a production decision must be made by our board of directors (the &#147;Board&#148;), financing for construction and development must be arranged and construction must be completed. In addition, we will be required to address certain infrastructure challenges, including a road for access, transportation of supplies and mineral concentrate, and obtain additional rights, including surface use rights and access rights. See &#147; Item 1A. Risk Factors. &#148; 

Significant Developments in 2015 

&#149; 

On June 19, 2015, we announced the completion of a Plan of Arrangement (the &#147;Arrangement&#148;) with Sunward Resources Ltd. (&#147;Sunward&#148;), a publicly listed company on the TSX, resulting in the acquisition of Sunward by NovaCopper. Under the terms of the Arrangement, Sunward shareholders received 0.3 of a NovaCopper Common Share for each Sunward Common Share held resulting in the Company issuing approximately 43.1 million Common Shares to Sunward shareholders and Sunward directors holding Sunward deferred share units. Each Sunward stock option outstanding was exchanged for a fully-vested option to purchase NovaCopper Common Shares (a &#147;Sunward Arrangement Option&#148;) for a period of 90 days, with the number of shares issuable and exercise price adjusted based on an exchange ratio of 0.3. A total of 2,505,000 Sunward Arrangement Options were issued to holders of Sunward stock options at closing. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#149; 

On October 21, 2015, we announced the drill results from our 2015 summer field program for the Arctic Project. In total, fourteen diamond drill holes were completed amounting to a total of 3,056 meters drilled. In addition to the twelve resource estimation drill holes, two drill holes, representing 631 meters drilled, were completed to support preliminary rock mechanics and geotechnical studies and a hydrogeological assessment of the proposed Arctic open-pit. All fourteen drill holes encountered mineralized intervals, defined as a minimum of 1.0 meter copper interval with average grade &#62;0.7% copper. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#149; 

On October 22, 2015, we announced that Alaska&#146;s Governor has authorized AIDEA to begin the environmental impact statement (&#147;EIS&#148;) process on AMDIAR. 

Significant Developments in 2014 

&#160; &#149; On March 18, 2014, NovaCopper reported an updated NI 43-101 resource estimate for the Bornite Project in a report entitled &#147;NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Bornite Project, Northwest Alaska, USA&#148;, dated effective April 1, 2014, which updated the resource estimate previously released on February 5, 2013. At the base case 0.5% copper cut-off grade, the Bornite Project is estimated to contain in-pit Indicated Resources of 14.1 million tonnes of 1.08% Cu or 334 million pounds of contained copper. At the base case 0.5% copper cut-off grade, the Bornite Project is estimated to contain in-pit Inferred Resources of 109.6 million tonnes of 0.94% Cu or 2,259 million pounds of contained copper. Resources are stated as potentially being economically viable in an open-pit mining scenario based on a projected metal price of $3.00 per pound copper, total site operating costs of $18.00 per tonne, 87% metallurgical recoveries and an average pit slope of 43 degrees. At the base case 1.5% copper cut-off grade, the Bornite Project is estimated to contain below-pit Inferred Resources of 55.6 million tonnes of 2.81% Cu or 3,437 million pounds of contained copper. Inferred resources are stated as potentially being economically viable in an underground mining scenario based on a projected metal price of $3.00 per pound copper, total site operating costs of $66.00 per tonne and an average metallurgical recovery of 87%. Inferred resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and whether they can be mined legally or economically. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of the Inferred resources will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. See &#147; Cautionary Note to United States Investors.&#148; 12 

&#160; &#149; 

On July 7, 2014, we announced the completion of a non-brokered private placement of approximately $7.5 million in units to existing shareholders. Each unit was priced at $1.15 per unit and consisted of one common share and one common share purchase warrant. Each common share purchase warrant entitles the holders to purchase one common share at a price of $1.60 per share for a period of five years from the closing date. Net proceeds from the private placement were $7.2 million. The gross proceeds raised were allocated for the 12 months following closing to fund $2.7 million on program expenditures, $4.0 million on general and administrative expenses including costs associated with the offering, and $0.8 million on one-time expenses incurred in reducing annual general and administrative expenses. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#149; 

On August 15, 2014, we announced the departure of Senior VP Exploration, Joseph Piekenbrock, VP Human Resources and Workforce Development, Sacha Iley, and VP Corporate Communications, Patrick Donnelly, from our senior management team to reduce our general and administrative expenses. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#149; 

On October 28, 2014, we announced the results of our 2014 re-logging and re-sampling program at the Bornite Project. During the 2014 field season, we re-logged the geology and re-sampled approximately 13,000 meters in 37 historical drill holes, originally drilled by Kennecott on the Bornite Project between 1959 and 1976, and submitted the samples for a complete 42 element Induced Coupled Plasma analysis. Of the 37 historic drill holes sampled, 5 holes had intervals of copper grading more than 0.5% copper, and 21 holes contained mineralization grading more than 0.2% copper. 

Significant Developments in 2013 

&#149; 

On March 28, 2012, the securityholders of NovaGold Resources Inc. (&#147;NovaGold&#148;) voted in favor of the special resolution approving the spin-out of NovaCopper Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary NovaCopper US Inc. (&#147;NovaCopper US&#148;) (&#147;Plan of Arrangement&#148; or &#147;Arrangement&#148;). Under the Plan of Arrangement, each holder of NovaGold warrants on record as of April 30, 2012 received the right to receive one NovaCopper Share for every six common shares of NovaGold represented by the warrant. On January 2, 2013, we announced that our largest shareholder, Electrum Strategic Resources L.P. (&#147;Electrum&#148;), added an additional 5.2 million NovaCopper Shares to its holdings through the exercise of NovaGold warrants. We received no proceeds from the exercise of the NovaGold warrants. Between January 10, 2013 to January 18, 2013, we issued an additional 0.9 million NovaCopper Shares to various holders upon their exercise of NovaGold warrants. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#149; 

On February 5, 2013, NovaCopper released an updated NI 43-101 resource estimate for the Bornite Project in a report entitled &#147;NI 43-101 Technical Report Resource Estimation &#150; South Reef and Ruby Creek zones, Bornite deposit, Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects, Northwest Alaska&#148;, further to the resource estimate previously released on July 18, 2012 with respect to the Ruby Creek zone. At the base case 1.0% copper cut-off grade, the South Reef zone at the Bornite Project, which lies roughly 400 to 600 meters southeast of the Ruby Creek zone, is estimated to contain Inferred Resources of 43.1 million tonnes of 2.54% Cu or 2,409 million pounds of contained copper. Inferred resources are stated as potentially being economically viable in an underground mining scenario based on a projected metal price of $2.75 per pound copper and total site operating costs of $60.00 per tonne. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. See &#147; Cautionary Note to United States Investors.&#148; 

&#160; &#149; 

On April 30, 2013, we announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (&#147;MOU&#148;) with AIDEA to investigate the viability of permitting and constructing an industrial access road to the Ambler mining district and the UKMP Projects. The MOU formalizes the roles of each party as they relate to advancing the AMDIAR, which AIDEA is expected to commence permitting in 2014. The MOU also allows AIDEA to investigate various ways to fund the construction and maintenance of the AMDIAR. Although no specific terms have yet been discussed on payment for usage of the AMDIAR, the arrangement that AIDEA entered into with Cominco Ltd. (now Teck Resources Ltd.) in 1986 for construction of the Red Dog Road and Port Facility may serve as a general template for a final financing agreement. This MOU is non-exclusive, meaning that other mining and exploration companies or other industrial users may also work in cooperation with AIDEA to support development of the AMDIAR by signing their own MOUs. 

&#160; &#160; &#149; 

On July 30, 2013, we reported a new Preliminary Economic Assessment (&#147;PEA&#148;) prepared under NI 43- 101 for the Arctic project in a report entitled &#147;Preliminary Economic Assessment Report on the Arctic Project, Ambler Mining District, Northwest Alaska.&#148; The PEA outlines an open-pit scenario of a 12-year mine life supporting a 10,000 tonne-per-day conventional grinding mill-and-flotation circuit at the Arctic deposit with a pre-tax net present value (&#147;NPV&#148;) of $927.7 million or 22.8% internal rate of return (&#147;IRR&#148;) and after-tax NPV of $537.2 million or 17.9% IRR at an 8% discount rate. Initial capital expenditures are estimated at $717.7 million with sustaining capital expenditures of $164.4 million. The base case scenario assumes long-term metal prices of $2.90/lb for copper, $0.85/lb for zinc, $0.90/lb for lead, $22.70/oz for silver and $1,300/oz for gold. The total average operating cost for the proposed mine is estimated at $63.93 per tonne milled. The PEA is preliminary in nature and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that the PEA will be realized. See &#147; Cautionary Note to United States Investors.&#148; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; 

On October 9, 2013, we announced the completion of our 2013 exploration field season program at our UKMP Projects which accomplished approximately 8,142 meters or 109% of planned drilling of which 4,684 meters was drilled at the Ruby Creek zone and 3,458 meters at the South Reef zone of the Bornite Project. Results from the drilling campaign were released throughout the fall of 2013. The 2013 exploration program was focused on expansion and further characterization of the resources identified in the 2013 Bornite resource technical report released in February 2013. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; 

On December 18, 2013, we announced results from our re-logging and re-sampling program of 33 historical drill holes at the Bornite Project. These holes were previously drilled and only selectively sampled by Kennecott within the Ruby Creek zone of the Bornite deposit. Of the 33 historic drill holes sampled, 26 holes had intervals of copper greater than 0.5% copper, and 29 holes contained mineralization greater than 0.2% copper. The objectives of the re-logging/re-sampling program were twofold: 1) to confirm and conduct a Quality Assurance/Quality Control (&#147;QA/QC&#148;) program on the historical sample results; and 2) to identify additional lower-grade (0.2-0.5% copper) shallow material, which was not previously sampled. The re-logging and re-sampling program has confirmed previously known high-grade mineralization. It is also expected to add additional lower-grade mineralization to the Company&#146;s mineral inventory. 

History of NovaCopper 

Spin-Out 

We were formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of NovaGold. At a special meeting of securityholders of NovaGold held on March 28, 2012, the securityholders voted in favour of a special resolution approving the distribution of Common Shares of NovaCopper to the shareholders of NovaGold as a return of capital through a statutory Plan of Arrangement under the Companies Act (Nova Scotia).

On April 30, 2012, all of the outstanding NovaCopper Common Shares were distributed to shareholders of NovaGold such that each NovaGold shareholder of record at the close of business on April 27, 2012 received one NovaCopper Common Share for every six common shares in the capital of NovaGold held at that time. The NovaCopper Common Shares were listed and posted for trading on the TSX and on the NYSE-MKT under the symbol NCQ on April 25, 2012. 

Agreement with NANA Regional Corporation 

On October 19, 2011, NANA Regional Corporation, Inc. (&#147;NANA&#148;), an Alaska Native Corporation headquartered in Kotzebue, Alaska, and NovaCopper US entered an Exploration Agreement and Option Agreement, as amended (the &#147;NANA Agreement&#148;) for the cooperative development of NANA&#146;s respective resource interests in the Ambler mining district of Northwest Alaska. The NANA Agreement consolidates our and NANA&#146;s land holdings into an approximately 142,831-hectare land package and provides a framework for the exploration and any future development of this high-grade and prospective poly-metallic belt. 

The NANA Agreement grants NovaCopper US the nonexclusive right to enter on, and the exclusive right to explore, the Bornite lands and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (&#147;ANCSA&#148;) lands (each as defined in the NANA Agreement) and in connection therewith, to construct and utilize temporary access roads, camps, airstrips and other incidental works. In consideration for this right, NovaCopper US paid to NANA $4 million in cash. NovaCopper US will also be required to make payments to NANA for scholarship purposes in accordance with the terms of the NANA Agreement. NovaCopper US has further agreed to use reasonable commercial efforts to train and employ NANA shareholders to perform work for NovaCopper US in connection with its operations on the Bornite lands, ANCSA lands and Ambler lands (as defined in the NANA Agreement) (collectively, the &#147;Lands&#148;). Under the NANA Agreement, NANA also has the right to appoint a board member to NovaCopper&#146;s Board within a five year period following our public listing on a stock exchange.

The NANA Agreement has a term of 20 years, with an option in favour of NovaCopper US to extend the term for an additional 10 years. The NANA Agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of the parties or by NANA if NovaCopper US does not meet certain expenditure requirements on the Bornite lands and ANCSA lands. 

If, following receipt of a feasibility study and the release for public comment of a related draft environmental impact statement, we decide to proceed with construction of a mine on the Lands, NovaCopper US will notify NANA in writing and NANA will have 120 days to elect to either (a) exercise a non-transferrable back-in-right to acquire an undivided ownership interest between 16% and 25% (as specified by NANA) of that specific project; or (b) not exercise its back-in-right, and instead receive a net proceeds royalty equal to 15% of the net proceeds realized by NovaCopper US from such project (following the recoupment by NovaCopper of all costs incurred, including operating, capital and carrying costs). The cost to exercise such back-in-right is equal to the percentage interest in the project multiplied by the difference between (i) all costs incurred by NovaCopper US or its affiliates on the project, including historical costs incurred prior to the date of the NANA Agreement together with interest on the costs; and (ii) $40 million (subject to exceptions). This amount will be payable by NANA to NovaCopper US in cash at the time the parties enter into a joint venture agreement and in no event will the amount be less than zero.

In the event that NANA elects to exercise its back-in-right, the parties will as soon as reasonably practicable form a joint venture, with NANA&#146;s interest being between 16% to 25% and NovaCopper US owning the balance of the interest in the joint venture. Upon formation of the joint venture, the joint venture will assume all of the obligations of NovaCopper US and be entitled to all the benefits of NovaCopper US under the NANA Agreement in connection with the mine to be developed and the related Lands. A party&#146;s failure to pay its proportionate share of costs in connection with the joint venture will result in dilution of its interest. Each party will have a right of first refusal over any proposed transfer of the other party&#146;s interest in the joint venture other than to an affiliate or for the purposes of granting security. A transfer by either party of any net proceeds royalty interest in a project other than for financing purposes will also be subject to a first right of refusal. A transfer of NANA&#146;s net smelter return on the Lands is subject to a first right of refusal by NovaCopper. 

In connection with possible development of a mine on the Bornite lands or ANCSA lands, NovaCopper US and NANA will execute a mining lease to allow NovaCopper US or the joint venture to construct and operate a mine on the Bornite lands or ANCSA lands. These leases will provide NANA a 2% net smelter royalty as to production from the Bornite lands and a 2.5% net smelter royalty as to production from the ANCSA lands. If NovaCopper US decides to proceed with construction of a mine on the Ambler lands, NANA will enter into a surface use agreement with NovaCopper US which will afford NovaCopper US access to the Ambler lands along routes approved by NANA on the Bornite lands or ANCSA lands. In consideration for the grant of such surface use rights, NovaCopper US will grant NANA a 1% net smelter royalty on production and an annual payment of $755 per acre (as adjusted for inflation each year beginning with the second anniversary of the effective date of the NANA Agreement and for each of the first 400 acres (and $100 for each additional acre) of the lands owned by NANA and used for access which are disturbed and not reclaimed. 

We have formed an oversight committee with NANA, which consists of four representatives from each of NovaCopper and NANA (the &#147;Oversight Committee&#148;). The Oversight Committee is responsible for certain planning and oversight matters carried out by us under the NANA Agreement. The planning and oversight matters that are the subject of the NANA Agreement will be determined by majority vote. The representatives of each of NovaCopper and NANA attending a meeting will have one vote in the aggregate and in the event of a tie, the NovaCopper representatives jointly shall have a deciding vote on all matters other than Subsistence Matters, as that term is defined in the NANA Agreement. There shall be no deciding vote on Subsistence Matters and we may not proceed with such matters unless approved by majority vote of the Oversight Committee or with the consent of NANA, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

Principal Markets 

We do not currently have a principal market. Our principal objective is to become a producer of copper.

Specialized Skill and Knowledge 

All aspects of our business require specialized skills and knowledge. Such skills and knowledge include the areas of geology, mining and accounting. See &#147; Executive Officers of NovaCopper &#148; for details as to the specific skills and knowledge of our directors and management. 

Environmental Protection 

Mining is an extractive industry that impacts the environment. Our goal is to evaluate ways to minimize that impact and to develop safe, responsible and profitable operations by developing natural resources for the benefit of our employees, shareholders and communities and maintain high standards for environmental performance at our Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects and Titiribi Project. We strive to meet or exceed environmental standards at our Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects and Titiribi Project. One way we do this is through collaborations with local communities in Colombia and Alaska, including Native Alaskan groups. Our environmental performance will be overseen at the Board level and environmental performance is the responsibility of the project manager. 

&#160; &#149; 

All new activities and operations will be managed for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In the absence of regulation, best management practices will be applied to manage environmental risk. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; 

We will strive to limit releases to the air, land or water and appropriately treat and dispose of waste. 

See &#147; Arctic Project &#150; Environmental Considerations. &#148; 

Employees 

As of November 30, 2015, we had 14 full-time employees, 7 of whom were employed at our executive office in Vancouver, BC, and 7 of whom were employed at our Colombia branch. The number of individuals employed by us fluctuates throughout the year depending on the season; however, during 2015, we had, on average, 18 employees working for us. We have entered into executive employment agreements with two individuals, the CEO and CFO.

We believe our success is dependent on the performance of our management and key employees, many of whom have specialized skills in exploration in Alaska and Colombia and the base metals industry. Substantially all of our exploration site employees have been active either in the Ambler mining district or Titiribi for the last five years and are knowledgeable as to the geology, metallurgy and infrastructure related to mining development. 

Segment Information 

The Company&#146;s reportable segments are based on geographic region for the Company&#146;s operations. Segment information relating to our assets is provided under the section heading &#147; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#148; below.

Competitive Conditions 

The mineral exploration and development industry is competitive in all phases of exploration, development and production. There is a high degree of competition faced by us in Alaska and elsewhere for skilled management employees, suitable contractors for drilling operations, technical and engineering resources, and necessary exploration and mining equipment, and many of these competitor companies have greater financial resources, operational expertise, and/or more advanced properties than us. Additionally, our operations are in a remote location where skilled resources and support services are limited. We have in place experienced management personnel and continue to evaluate the required expertise and skills to carry out our operations. As a result of this competition, we may be unable to achieve our exploration and development in the future on terms we consider acceptable or at all. See &#147; Item 1A. Risk Factors. &#148;
