(1) During the year ended December 31, 2015, GRIL was re-registered and the entity's legal name was amended from Greenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Limited, to Greenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company, in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2014 of Ireland and as stipulated by the Central Bank of Ireland for all regulated insurance and reinsurance entities in Ireland. 

Company Overview 

&#160; 

Greenlight Capital Re is a holding company that was incorporated in July 2004 under the laws of the Cayman Islands. In August 2004, we raised gross proceeds of $212.2 million from private placements of Greenlight Capital Re&#8217;s Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares, or, collectively, the ordinary shares. On May 24, 2007, Greenlight Capital Re raised proceeds of $208.3 million, net of underwriting fees, in an initial public offering of Class A ordinary shares, as well as an additional $50.0 million from a private placement of Class B ordinary shares. 

&#160; 

We are a Cayman Islands headquartered global specialist property and casualty reinsurer with a reinsurance and investment strategy that we believe differentiates us from most of our competitors. We conduct our reinsurance operations through two licensed and regulated reinsurance entities: Greenlight Re, based in the Cayman Islands, and GRIL, based in Dublin, Ireland. Greenlight Re provides multi-line property and casualty reinsurance globally, while GRIL focuses mainly on the European market and primarily serves clients located in Europe. Our goal is to build long-term shareholder value by selectively offering customized reinsurance solutions, in markets where capacity and alternatives are limited, which we believe will yield favorable long-term returns on equity. 

&#160; 

We aim to complement our underwriting results with a non-traditional investment approach in order to achieve higher rates of return over the long term than reinsurance companies that employ more traditional, fixed-income investment strategies. We manage our investment portfolio according to a value-oriented philosophy, in which we take long positions in perceived undervalued securities and short positions in perceived overvalued securities. 

&#160; 

In addition, from time to time, we may seek to form long-term strategic alliances with insurance companies and general agents to complement our property and casualty reinsurance business and our non-traditional investment approach. To facilitate such strategic alliances, we formed Verdant, which, among other activities, has made and may make strategic investments in a select group of property and casualty insurers and general agents in the United States. 

&#160; 

Because we employ an opportunistic underwriting philosophy, period-to-period comparisons of our underwriting results may not be meaningful. In addition, our historical investment results may not necessarily be indicative of future performance. Due to the nature of our reinsurance and investment strategies, our operating results will likely fluctuate from period to period. 

Description of Business 

&#160; 

Greenlight Re is licensed and regulated by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority ("CIMA") to write property and casualty reinsurance business as well as long term business (e.g., life insurance, long term disability, long term care, etc.); however, to date we have not written any long term business. GRIL is licensed and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland ("CBI") to write property and casualty reinsurance business. Currently, we manage our business on the basis of one operating segment: property and casualty reinsurance. We currently offer excess of loss and quota share products in the property and casualty market. Our underwriting operations are designed to capitalize on inefficiencies that we perceive exist in the traditional 

Link to Table of Contents 

approach to underwriting. We believe that we conduct our business differently from traditional reinsurers in multiple ways, including: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

we focus on offering customized reinsurance solutions to select customers at times and in markets where capacity and alternatives are limited rather than primarily pursuing and participating in broadly available traditional property and casualty opportunities; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

we aim to build a reinsurance portfolio comprised principally of high frequency and low severity contracts with favorable ultimate economic results measured after all loss payments have been made rather than focusing on interim reported results when losses may be incurred but not yet reported or paid; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

we generally seek to act as the lead underwriter on a majority of the contracts we underwrite in an effort to obtain greater influence in negotiating pricing, terms and conditions. We may from time to time participate in contracts that have been negotiated and priced by another party. For example, on some longer duration casualty business that is comprised of larger, syndicated reinsurance placements, we may follow the market on these transactions; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

we maintain a small group of experienced generalist underwriters that are capable of underwriting many lines of property and casualty business rather than a large staff of underwriters, each with an individual, specific focus on certain lines of business; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

we implement a "cradle to grave" service philosophy where the same deal team underwrites and services each reinsurance contract rather than separating underwriting and servicing duties among many employees; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

we compensate our management with a cash bonus structure largely dependent on our underwriting results over a multi-year period rather than on premium volume or preliminary underwriting results in any given financial accounting period. 

&#160; 

Our investment strategy, like our reinsurance strategy, is designed to maximize returns over the long term while minimizing the risk of capital loss. Unlike the investment strategies of many of our traditional competitors, which invest primarily in fixed-income securities either directly or through fixed-fee arrangements with one or more investment managers, our investment strategy is to invest in long and short positions primarily in publicly-traded equity and corporate debt instruments exclusively through a joint venture with DME Advisors LLC ("DME"). Our investment advisor, DME Advisors, is compensated with a fixed annual fee based on assets under management and the joint venture participant, DME, is compensated on the positive performance of our portfolio, subject to a loss carry forward. DME Advisors, which makes investments on our behalf, is a value-oriented investment advisor that analyzes companies' available financial data, business strategies and prospects in an effort to identify undervalued and overvalued securities. DME Advisors and DME are both controlled by David Einhorn, the Chairman of our Board of Directors and the President of Greenlight Capital, Inc. DME Advisors has the contractual right to manage substantially all of our investable assets until December 31, 2016 , and is required to follow our investment guidelines and to act in a manner that is fair and equitable in allocating investment opportunities to us. However, DME Advisors is not otherwise restricted with respect to the nature or timing of making investments for our account. 

&#160; 

We measure our success by long-term growth in book value per share, which we believe is the most comprehensive gauge of the performance of our business. Accordingly, our incentive compensation plans are designed to align employee and shareholder interests. Compensation under our cash bonus plan is largely dependent on the ultimate underwriting returns of our business measured over a multi-year period, rather than premium targets or estimated underwriting profitability for the year in which we initially underwrote the business. 

&#160; 

We characterize the reinsurance risks we assume as frequency or severity and aim to balance the risks and opportunities of our underwriting activities by creating a diversified portfolio of both types of businesses, although over the long term we generally have a preference for frequency business. 

&#160; 

Frequency business is characterized as contracts containing a potentially large number of smaller losses emanating from multiple events. Clients generally buy this protection to increase their own underwriting capacity and typically select a reinsurer based upon the reinsurer's financial strength, service and expertise. We expect the results of frequency business to be less volatile than those of severity business from period to period due to its greater predictability. We also expect that over time the profit margins and return on equity of our frequency business will be lower than those of our severity business. 

&#160; 

Severity business is typically characterized as contracts with the potential for significant losses emanating from one event or multiple events. Clients generally buy this protection to reduce volatility from their balance sheets, and accordingly, we 

Link to Table of Contents 

expect the results of severity business to be volatile from period to period. However, over the long term, we also expect that our severity business will generate higher profit margins and return on equity than our frequency business. 

&#160; 

While we intend to continue to add to, and diversify, our portfolio, our allocation of risk will vary based on our perception of the opportunities available in each line of business. Moreover, our focus on certain lines will fluctuate based upon market conditions and we may only offer or underwrite a limited number of lines in any given period. We intend to continue to: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

target markets where capacity and alternatives are underserved or constrained; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

strengthen and expand relationships with existing clients.

Additional information about our business is set forth in "Item 7 &#8212; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 15 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included herein. 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

A majority of our business is sourced through reinsurance brokers. Brokerage distribution channels provide us with access to an efficient, variable cost and global distribution system without the significant time and expense that would be incurred in creating a wholly-owned distribution network. We believe that our financial strength rating, unencumbered balance sheet and superior client service are essential for creating long-term relationships with clients and brokers. 

&#160; 

We aim to build and strengthen long-term relationships with global reinsurance brokers. Our management team has significant relationships with most of the primary and specialty broker intermediaries in the reinsurance marketplace. We believe that by maintaining close relationships with brokers we will be able to continue to obtain access to a broad range of reinsurance clients and opportunities. We focus on the quality and financial strength of any brokerage firm with which we do business. Brokers do not have the authority to bind us to any reinsurance contract. 

&#160; 

Reinsurance brokers receive a brokerage commission that is usually a percentage of gross premiums written. We seek to become the first choice of brokers and clients by providing: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

customized solutions that address the specific business needs of our clients; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

rapid and substantive responses to proposal and pricing quote requests; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

timely payment of claims; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

financial security; and 

&#160;

We believe that by maintaining close relationships with brokers, we are able to obtain access to a range of potential clients that meet our criteria. We meet frequently in the Cayman Islands, Ireland and elsewhere with brokers and senior

representatives of clients and prospective clients. All contract submissions are received, reviewed and approved in our executive offices in the Cayman Islands or Ireland. Due to our dependence on brokers, the inability to obtain business from them could adversely affect our business strategy. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Business &#8212; The inability to obtain business provided from brokers could adversely affect our business strategy and results of operations. " In addition, we may assume a degree of credit risk of our reinsurance brokers. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Business &#8212; We may be subject to the credit risk of our brokers, cedents and agents. " 

&#32;We believe that diversity in our sources of business helps reduce any potential adverse effects arising out of the termination of any one of our business relationships. 

Underwriting and Risk Management 

&#160; 

We have established a small team of generalist underwriters and actuaries to operate our reinsurance business. We believe that our underwriters' experience, coupled with our approach to underwriting, allows us to deploy our capital in a variety of lines of business and to capitalize on opportunities that we believe offer favorable returns on equity over the long term. Our underwriters and actuaries have expertise in a number of lines of business and we also look to outside consultants on a fee-for-service basis to help us with niche areas of expertise when we deem it appropriate. We generally apply the following underwriting and risk management principles: 

&#160; 

Economics of Results 

&#160; 

Our primary goal is to build a reinsurance portfolio that has attractive economic results. We may underwrite a reinsurance contract that may not demonstrate immediate short-term accounting benefits if we believe it will provide a favorable return on capital over the life of the contract. In pricing our products, we assume investment returns that approximate the risk-free rate, which we review and adjust, if necessary, on an annual basis. 

&#160; 

Actuarially Based Pricing 

&#160; 

We have developed and use proprietary actuarial models and also use several commercially available tools to price our business. Our models not only consider conventional underwriting metrics, but also incorporate a component for risk aversion that places greater weight on scenarios that result in greater losses. We price each transaction based on our view of the merits and structure of the transaction. 

&#160; 

Team Approach 

&#160; 

Each transaction typically is assigned to a deal team comprised of at least an underwriter and an actuary to evaluate underwriting, structuring and pricing. Prior to committing capital to any transaction, the deal team creates a deal analysis memorandum that highlights the key components of the proposed transaction and presents the proposed transaction to a senior group of staff, including underwriting, actuarial, risk management and finance. This group is provided an opportunity to critically evaluate the proposed transaction. Additionally, our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Underwriting Officer must agree that the transaction meets our underwriting guidelines before we submit a firm proposal. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Underwriting Officer maintain the exclusive ultimate authority to bind contracts. 

Act as Lead Underwriter 

&#160; 

Typically, one reinsurer acts as the lead underwriter in negotiating principal policy terms and pricing of reinsurance contracts. We aim to act as the lead underwriter for the majority of the aggregate premiums that we underwrite. We believe that lead underwriting is an important factor in achieving long-term success, as lead underwriters typically have greater influence in negotiating pricing, terms and conditions. In addition, we believe that reinsurers that lead policies are generally solicited for a broader range of business and have greater access to attractive opportunities. However, we may from time to time participate in contracts that have been negotiated and priced by another party. For example, on some longer duration casualty business that is comprised of larger, syndicated reinsurance placements, we may follow the market on these transactions. 

&#160; 

Alignment of Company and Client&#8217;s Interests 

&#160; 

We seek to ensure that each contract we underwrite aligns our interests with our client&#8217;s interests. Specifically, depending upon the opportunity we may seek to: 

&#160; 

Link to Table of Contents 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

pay our clients a commission based upon a predetermined percentage of the profit we realize on the business, which we refer to as a profit commission; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

provide that the client pays a predetermined amount of all losses before our reinsurance policy incurs a loss payment, which we refer to as self-insured retentions; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

provide that the client pays a predetermined proportion of all losses above a predetermined amount, which we refer to as co-participation; and/or 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

charge the client a premium for reinstatement of reinsurance coverage to the full amount, which we refer to as reinstatement premium, if coverage has been reduced as a result of a reinsurance loss payment. 

We believe that through profit commissions, self-insured retentions, co-participation, reinstatement premiums and other terms within the contract, our clients are provided with an incentive to manage our interests. We believe that aligning our interests with our clients' interests promotes accurate reporting of information, timely settling and management of claims and limits the potential for disputes. 

&#160; &#160; 

Integrated Underwriting Operations 

&#160; 

We implement a "cradle to grave" service philosophy where the same deal team underwrites and oversees each reinsurance contract. We believe this method enables us to best understand the risks and likelihood of loss for any particular contract and to provide superior client service. &#32; 

Detailed Contract Diligence 

&#160; 

We are highly selective in the contracts we choose to underwrite and spend a significant amount of time with our clients and brokers to understand the risks and appropriately structure the contracts. Where necessary, we conduct or contract for on-site audits or reviews of the clients' underwriting files, systems and operations. We usually obtain significant amounts of data from our clients to conduct a thorough actuarial modeling analysis. As part of our pricing and underwriting process, we assess, among other factors: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

the client&#8217;s and industry's historical loss data; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

the expected duration for claims to fully develop; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

the client&#8217;s pricing and underwriting strategies; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

the geographic areas in which the client is doing business and its market share; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

the reputation and financial strength of the client; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

the reputation and expertise of the broker; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

the likelihood of establishing a long-term relationship with the client and the broker; and 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

reports provided by independent industry specialists. 

&#160; 

Underwriting Authorities 

&#160; 

We use actuarial models that we produce and apply our underwriting guidelines to analyze each reinsurance opportunity before we commit capital. The Underwriting Committee of our Board of Directors, which we refer to as the Underwriting Committee, sets parameters for zonal and aggregate property catastrophic caps and limits for maximum loss potential under any individual contract. The Underwriting Committee must approve any exceptions to the established limits. Our approach to risk control imposes an absolute loss limit on our natural catastrophic exposures as well as an estimate of probable maximum losses, and we have also established zonal and aggregate limits. We manage all non-catastrophic exposures and other risks by analyzing our maximum loss potential on a contract-by-contract basis. The maximum underwriting authorities, as set by our Underwriting Committee, may be amended from time to time, including as and when our capital base changes. 

&#160; 

Retrocessional Coverage 

&#160; 

We may from time to time purchase retrocessional coverage for one or more of the following reasons: to manage our overall exposure, to reduce our net liability on individual risks, to obtain additional underwriting capacity and to balance our underwriting portfolio. Additionally, retrocession can be used as a mechanism to share the risks and rewards of business written and, therefore, can be used as a tool to align our interests with those of our counterparties. 

&#160; 

Link to Table of Contents 

The amount of retrocessional coverage that we purchase varies based on numerous factors, some of which include the inherent riskiness of the portfolio of business we write and the level of our capital base. Given our opportunistic approach to underwriting, which may change the composition and inherent riskiness of our underwriting portfolio on an annual basis, it is not possible to predict the level of retrocessional coverage that we will purchase in any given year. To date, our retrocessional coverage has been primarily used as a tool to align our interests with those of our counterparties. 

&#160; 

We intend to only purchase uncollateralized retrocessional coverage from a reinsurer with a minimum financial strength rating of "A- (Excellent)" from A.M. Best Company, Inc. ("A.M. Best") or an equivalent rating from a recognized rating service. For non-rated reinsurers, we monitor and obtain collateral in the form of cash, funds withheld, letters of credit, regulatory trusts or other collateral in the form of guarantees. As of December 31, 2015 , the aggregate amount due from reinsurers from retrocessional coverages represents 1.1% &#32;( 2014 : 4.4% ) of our gross outstanding loss reserves. For further details please see Note 8 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers to assess their ability to honor their obligations. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , no &#32;provision for uncollectible losses recoverable was considered necessary. 

Capital Allocation 

&#160; 

We allocate capital to each contract that we bind. Our capital allocation methodology uses the probability and magnitude of potential for economic loss. We allocate capital for the period from each contract&#8217;s inception until the risk is resolved. We have developed a proprietary return on equity capital allocation model to evaluate and price each reinsurance contract that we underwrite. We use different return on equity thresholds depending on the type and risk characteristics of the business we underwrite. 

Claims Management 

&#160; 

Our claims management process begins upon receipt of claims submissions from our clients, which the underwriter reviews for authorization prior to entry and settlement. Additionally, our in-house claims manager is responsible for overseeing the review of claims and providing approval for complex or large claim settlements. We believe this ensures that we pay claims consistently within the terms and conditions of each contract. Depending on the size of the claim payment, additional approvals for payment must be obtained from our executive officers. 

&#160; 

Where necessary, we conduct or contract for on-site claims and underwriting audits at cedents and third party claims handlers, particularly for large accounts and for those whose performance differs from our expectations. Through these audits, we evaluate and monitor ceding companies&#8217; claims-handling practices, including the organization of their claims departments, their fact-finding and investigation techniques, their loss notifications, the adequacy of their reserves, their negotiation and settlement practices and their adherence to claims-handling guidelines. 

&#160; 

We recognize that fair interpretation of our reinsurance agreements with our clients and timely payment of covered claims are valuable services to our clients. 

Reserves 

&#160; 

Our reserving philosophy is to set reserves to our best estimate of the actual results that stem from the risks underwritten. Our actuaries provide reserving estimates on a quarterly basis calculated to meet our estimated future obligations. We reserve on a transaction by transaction basis. We engage independent external actuaries who review and provide an opinion on these estimates at least once a year. Due to the use of different assumptions, accounting treatment and loss experience, the amount we establish as reserves with respect to individual risks, transactions or classes of business may be greater or less than those established by clients or ceding companies. Reserves may also include unearned premiums, premium deposits, profit sharing earned but not yet paid, claims reported but not yet paid, claims incurred but not reported and claims in the process of settlement. 

&#160; 

Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent our best estimate of the expected cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of the claim. Although the methods for establishing reserves are well-tested, some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation. We base these estimates on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well as estimates of future trends in claim severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors, including the actions of third parties, which are beyond our control.

Collateral Arrangements and Letter of Credit Facilities 

&#160; 

We are licensed and admitted as an insurer only in the Cayman Islands and the European Economic Area. Many jurisdictions, such as the United States, do not permit clients to take credit for reinsurance on their statutory financial statements if such reinsurance is obtained from unlicensed or non-admitted insurers without appropriate collateral. As a result, we anticipate that all of our U.S. clients and a portion of our non-U.S. clients will require us to provide collateral for the contracts we bind with them. We expect this collateral to take the form of funds withheld, trust arrangements or letters of credit. As of December 31, 2015 , we had letter of credit facilities with an aggregate capacity of $720.0 million &#32;( 2014 : $760.0 million ). As of December 31, 2015 , we had issued letters of credit totaling $245.6 million &#32;( 2014 : $273.7 million ) to clients. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015 , we had pledged $78.6 million &#32;( 2014 : nil ) as collateral through trust arrangements. The failure to maintain, replace or increase our letter of credit facilities and trust arrangements on commercially acceptable terms may significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Relating to Our Business &#8212; Our failure to maintain sufficient collateral arrangements or to increase our collateral capacity on commercially acceptable terms as we grow could significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy . " 

Competition 

&#160; 

The reinsurance industry is highly competitive. We compete with major reinsurers, most of which are well established, have significant operating histories and strong financial strength ratings, and have developed long-standing client relationships. 

&#160; 

Our competitors include ACE Limited, Everest Re, General Re Corporation, Hannover Re Group, Munich Reinsurance Company, PartnerRe Ltd., Swiss Reinsurance Company, Third Point Reinsurance Ltd. and Transatlantic Reinsurance Company, as well as smaller companies and other niche reinsurers. Although we seek to provide coverage where capacity and alternatives are limited, we directly compete with these larger companies due to the breadth of their coverage across the property and casualty market in substantially all lines of business. 

&#160; 

While most of our competitors have had a longer operating history than us, we believe that our approach to underwriting allows us to be successful in underwriting transactions against more established competitors. 

Ratings 

&#160; 

Currently, our reinsurance subsidiaries, Greenlight Re and GRIL are both rated "A (Excellent)" by A.M. Best. On October 23, 2015, A.M. Best affirmed Greenlight Re's rating of "A (Excellent)" but revised the outlook from stable to negative. The "A (Excellent)" rating from A.M. Best is the third highest of 15 ratings. We believe that a strong rating is an important factor in the marketing of reinsurance products to clients and brokers. These ratings reflect the rating agency&#8217;s opinion of our reinsurance subsidiaries' financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations. It is not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our Class A ordinary shares. 

&#160; 

The failure to maintain a strong rating may significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Relating to Our Business &#8212; A downgrade or withdrawal of either of our A.M. Best ratings may significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy successfully ." 

Regulations 

&#160; 

Cayman Islands Insurance Regulation 

&#160; 

The legislative framework for the carrying on of insurance and reinsurance business in and from within the Cayman Islands is comprised of The Insurance Law, 2010 and underlying regulations thereto (the "Law") which was brought into force in the Cayman Islands effective as of November 1, 2012. 

Greenlight Re holds a Class D insurer license issued in accordance with the terms of the Law and is subject to regulation by CIMA. 

As the holder of a Class D insurer license, Greenlight Re is permitted to carry on reinsurance business from the Cayman Islands, but, except with the prior written approval of CIMA, may not carry on any insurance or reinsurance business where the underlying risk originates and resides in the Cayman Islands. 

&#160; 

Greenlight Re is required to comply with the following principal requirements under the Law: 

Link to Table of Contents 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

to maintain capital and a margin of solvency in accordance with the capital and solvency requirements prescribed by the Law; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

to carry on its business in accordance with the terms of the license application submitted to CIMA and to seek the prior approval of CIMA for any proposed change thereto; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

to maintain adequate arrangements for the management of risks and a system of governance as approved by CIMA; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

to maintain a minimum of at least two directors and to seek the prior approval of CIMA in respect of the appointment of directors and officers and to provide CIMA with information in connection therewith and notification of any changes thereto; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

to have a place of business in the Cayman Islands and to maintain such resources, including staff and facilities, books and records as CIMA considers appropriate having regard for the nature and scale of the business of Greenlight Re; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

to submit to CIMA an annual return in the prescribed form together with: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

1. financial statements prepared in accordance with any internationally recognized accounting standards, audited by an independent auditor approved by CIMA; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

2. an actuarial valuation of Greenlight Re's assets and liabilities, certified by an actuary approved by CIMA; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

3. certification of solvency prepared by a person approved by CIMA in accordance with the prescribed requirements; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

4. confirmation that the information contained in Greenlight Re's license application, as modified by any subsequent changes, remains correct; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

5. such other information as may be prescribed by CIMA; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

to pay an annual license fee. 

It is the duty of CIMA: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

to maintain a general review of insurance practices in the Cayman Islands; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

to examine the affairs or business of any licensee or other person carrying on, or who has carried on, insurance business in order to ensure that the Law has been complied with and that the licensee is in a sound financial position and is carrying on its business in a fit and proper manner; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

to examine and report on the annual returns delivered to CIMA in terms of the Law; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

to examine and make recommendations with respect to, among other things, proposals for the revocation of licenses and cases of suspected insolvency of licensed entities. 

&#160; 

Where CIMA believes that a licensee is committing, or is about to commit or pursue, an act that is an unsafe or unsound business practice, CIMA may direct the licensee to cease or refrain from committing the act or pursuing the offending course of conduct. Failure to comply with such a CIMA direction may be punishable on summary conviction by a fine of up to 100,000 Cayman Islands dollars (which is approximately US$120,000) or to imprisonment for a term of five years or to both, and on conviction on indictment to a fine of 500,000 Cayman Islands dollars (which is approximately US$600,000) or to imprisonment for a term of ten years or to both and to an additional 10,000 Cayman Islands dollars (which is approximately US$12,000) for every day after conviction that the breach continues. 

&#160; 

Whenever CIMA believes that a licensee is or may become unable to meet its obligations as they fall due, is carrying on business in a manner likely to be detrimental to the public interest or to the interest of its creditors or policyholders, has contravened the terms of the Law or has otherwise behaved in such a manner so as to cause CIMA to call into question the licensee&#8217;s fitness, CIMA may take one of a number of steps, including requiring the licensee to take steps to rectify the matter, suspending the license of the licensee, revoking the license, imposing conditions upon the license and amending or revoking 

Link to Table of Contents 

any such condition, requiring the substitution of any director, manager or officer of the licensee, at the expense of the licensee, appointing a person to advise the licensee on the proper conduct of its affairs and to report to CIMA thereon, at the expense of the licensee, appointing a person to assume control of the licensee&#8217;s affairs or otherwise requiring such action to be taken by the licensee as CIMA considers necessary. To date, we have not been subject to any such actions from CIMA. 

Other Regulations in the Cayman Islands 

&#160; 

As Cayman Islands exempted companies, Greenlight Capital Re and Greenlight Re may not carry on business or trade locally in the Cayman Islands except in furtherance of their business outside the Cayman Islands, and are prohibited from soliciting the public of the Cayman Islands to subscribe for any of their securities or debt. We are further required to file a return with the Registrar of Companies in January of each year and to pay an annual registration fee at that time. 

&#160; 

The Cayman Islands has no exchange controls restricting dealings in currencies or securities. 

Ireland Insurance Regulations 

Our Irish subsidiary, GRIL, is authorized as a non-life reinsurance undertaking by the CBI. The Solvency II Directive 2009/138/EC (known as "Solvency II") introduced a new European regulatory regime for insurers and reinsurers and has been transposed into Irish law by the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015 (the "Irish Regulations"). GRIL is now authorized to conduct reinsurance business under provisions of the Irish Regulations which became effective on January 1, 2016. GRIL is required to comply at all times with the Irish Regulations, the Irish Insurance Acts 1909 to 2015, regulations relating to insurance business or reinsurance business promulgated under the European Communities Act 1972, the Irish Central Bank Acts 1942 to 2015 as amended, regulations promulgated thereunder and directions, guidelines and codes of conduct issued by CBI (collectively the "Irish Insurance Acts and Regulations"). In addition, GRIL is required to meet risk-based solvency requirements imposed under Solvency II on insurers and reinsurers across all member states, including Ireland. Solvency II, together with European Commission "delegated acts" and guidance issued by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, sets out classification and eligibility requirements, including the characteristics required for any capital contribution to qualify as regulatory capital. 

&#160; 

Overview of Investments 

&#160; 

Our investment portfolio is managed by DME Advisors, a value-oriented investment advisor that analyzes companies' available financial data, business strategies and prospects in an effort to identify undervalued and overvalued securities. DME Advisors is controlled by David Einhorn, the Chairman of our Board of Directors and the President of Greenlight Capital, Inc. Effective January 1, 2014 we entered into a second amended and restated agreement (the "venture agreement"), wherein the Company, Greenlight Re, GRIL, and DME have agreed to create a joint venture for the purposes of managing certain jointly held assets. The venture agreement, which replaces the previous agreement dated August 31, 2010, expires on December 31, 2016 &#32;and will renew automatically for successive three-year periods unless at least 90 days prior to the end of the then current term, DME notifies the other participants of its desire to terminate the venture agreement or any other participant notifies DME of its desire to withdraw from the venture agreement. Simultaneously with the venture agreement, we entered into an investment advisory agreement (the "advisory agreement") with DME Advisors to provide discretionary advisory services relating to the assets and liabilities of the venture. The advisory agreement term period mirrors that of the venture agreement. 

&#32; 

Pursuant to the venture agreement and the advisory agreement, DME Advisors has the exclusive right to manage substantially all of our investable assets, subject to the investment guidelines adopted by the respective Boards of Directors of Greenlight Re and GRIL, for so long as the venture agreement is in effect. DME Advisors receives a monthly management fee based on an annual rate of 1.5% of the capital account balance of each participant. In addition, DME receives a performance allocation based on the positive performance change in such participant&#8217;s capital account equal to 20% of net profits calculated per annum, subject to a loss carry forward provision. 

The loss carry forward provision allows DME to earn a reduced performance allocation of 10% on profits in any year subsequent to the year in which a participant's capital account (other than DME) incurs a loss, until all the losses are recouped and an additional amount equal to 150% of the loss is earned. DME is not entitled to a performance allocation in a year in which such participant's capital account incurs a loss. 

&#160; 

DME Advisors is required to follow our investment guidelines and act in a manner that it considers fair and equitable in allocating investment opportunities to us, but the advisory agreement does not otherwise impose any specific obligations or requirements concerning the allocation of time, effort or investment opportunities to us or any restrictions on the nature or timing of investments for our account, or other accounts that DME Advisors or its affiliates may manage. In addition, DME 

Link to Table of Contents 

Advisors can outsource to sub-advisors without our consent or approval. In the event that DME Advisors and any of its affiliates attempt to simultaneously invest in the same opportunity, the opportunity will be allocated pro-rata as reasonably determined by DME Advisors and its affiliates. Affiliates of DME Advisors presently serve as general partner or investment advisor of Greenlight Capital, L.P., Greenlight Capital Qualified, L.P., Greenlight Capital Offshore, Ltd., Greenlight Capital Offshore Qualified, Ltd., Greenlight Capital Offshore Partners, Greenlight Capital (Gold), L.P., Greenlight Capital Offshore (Gold), Ltd., Greenlight Capital Offshore Master (Gold), Ltd., Greenlight Masters, L.P., Greenlight Masters Qualified, L.P., Greenlight Masters Offshore, Ltd., Greenlight Masters Offshore I, Ltd., Greenlight Masters Offshore Partners and Greenlight Masters Partners (collectively the "Greenlight Funds"). 

&#160; 

We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all of our current and future subsidiaries to enter into substantially similar venture agreements, provided that any such agreement shall be terminable on the same date that the venture agreement is terminable. 

&#160; 

We have agreed to release DME and DME Advisors and their affiliates from, and to indemnify and hold them harmless against, any liability arising out of the venture agreement and the advisory agreement, subject to certain exceptions. Furthermore, DME and DME Advisors and their affiliates have agreed to indemnify us against any liability incurred in connection with certain actions. 

&#160; 

Greenlight Re or GRIL may also withdraw as a participant under the venture agreement prior to the expiration of its term at any time only &#8216;&#8216;for cause,&#8217;&#8217; which the venture agreement defines as: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

a material violation of applicable law relating to DME's or DME Advisors&#8217; advisory business; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

DME's or DME Advisors' gross negligence, willful misconduct or reckless disregard of any of DME's obligations under the venture agreement or DME Advisors' obligations under the advisory agreement; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

a material breach by DME or DME Advisors of Greenlight Re&#8217;s or GRIL&#8217;s investment guidelines that is not cured within a 15-day period; or 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

a material breach by DME or DME Advisors of its obligations to return and deliver assets as we may request. 

In addition, GRIL may withdraw as a participant under the venture agreement prior to the expiration of its term due to unsatisfactory long term performance of DME Advisors, as determined solely by the Board of Directors of GRIL on each anniversary date of the venture agreement. 

Investment Strategy 

&#160; 

DME Advisors implements a value-oriented investment strategy by taking long positions in perceived undervalued securities and short positions in perceived overvalued securities. DME Advisors aims to achieve high absolute rates of return while minimizing the risk of capital loss. DME Advisors attempts to determine the risk/return characteristics of potential investments by analyzing factors such as the risk that expected cash flows will not be obtained, the volatility of the cash flows, the leverage of the underlying business and the security's liquidity, among others. 

&#160; 

Our Board of Directors conducts reviews of our investment portfolio activities and oversees our investment guidelines to meet our investment objectives. We believe our investment approach, while less predictable than traditional fixed-income portfolios, complements our reinsurance business and will achieve higher rates of return over the long term than reinsurance companies that invest predominantly in fixed-income securities. Our investment guidelines are designed to maintain adequate liquidity to fund our reinsurance operations and to protect against unexpected events. 

&#160; 

DME Advisors, which is contractually obligated to adhere to our investment guidelines, makes investment decisions on our behalf, which may include buying publicly listed equity securities and corporate debt, selling securities short and investing in private placements, futures, currencies, commodities, credit default swaps, interest rate swaps, sovereign debt, derivatives and other instruments. As of December 31, 2015 , DME Advisors was in compliance with our investment guidelines. 

&#160;

Investment Guidelines 

&#160; 

The investment guidelines adopted by the respective Boards of Directors of Greenlight Re and GRIL, which may be amended or modified from time to time, take into account restrictions imposed on us by regulators, our liability mix, requirements to maintain an appropriate claims paying rating by ratings agencies and requirements of lenders. 

As of the date hereof, the investment guidelines for Greenlight Re currently state: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Composition of Investments: At least 80% of the assets in the investment portfolio will be held in debt or equity securities (including swaps) of publicly-traded companies (or their subsidiaries) and governments of the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development, (the "OECD"), high income countries, cash, cash equivalents and gold. No more than 10% of the assets in the investment portfolio will be held in private equity securities. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Concentration of Investments: Other than cash, cash equivalents, United States government obligations and gold, no single investment in the investment portfolio will constitute more than 20% of the portfolio. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Liquidity: Assets will be invested in such fashion that Greenlight Re has a reasonable expectation that it can meet any of its liabilities as they become due. Greenlight Re will review with the investment advisor the liquidity of the portfolio on a periodic basis. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Monitoring: Greenlight Re will require the investment advisor to re-evaluate each position in the investment portfolio and to monitor changes in intrinsic value and trading value and provide monthly reports on the investment portfolio to Greenlight Re as Greenlight Re may reasonably determine. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Leverage: The investment portfolio may not employ greater than 15% indebtedness for borrowed money, including net margin balances, for extended time periods. The investment advisor may employ, in the normal course of business, up to 30% indebtedness for periods of less than 30 days. 

The investment guidelines for GRIL are identical to Greenlight Re's except for concentration of investments and leverage, which for GRIL are as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Concentration of Investments: Other than cash, cash equivalents and United States government obligations, (1) no single investment in the investment portfolio will constitute more than 10% of the portfolio, (2) the 10 largest investments shall not constitute greater than 50% of the total investment portfolio, and (3) the investment portfolio shall at all times be comprised of a minimum of 50 debt or equity securities of publicly traded companies (or their subsidiaries). 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Leverage: The investment portfolio may not employ greater than 5% indebtedness for borrowed money, including net margin balances, for extended time periods. The investment advisor may use, in the normal course of business, an aggregate of up to 20% net margin leverage for periods of less than 30 days.

DME Advisors also reports the composition of our managed portfolio on a delta adjusted and notional exposure basis, which it believes is the appropriate manner in which to assess the exposure and profile of investments and is the way in which it manages the portfolio. This exposure analysis does not include cash (U.S. dollar and foreign currencies), gold and other commodities, credit default swaps, sovereign debt, foreign currency derivatives, interest rate options and other macro positions. In addition, under this methodology, the exposure for total return swaps is reported at full notional amount. The notional amount of a derivative contract is the underlying value upon which payment obligations are computed. For an equity total return swap, for example, the notional amount is the number of shares underlying the swap multiplied by the market price of those shares. Options are reported at their delta adjusted basis. The delta of an option is the sensitivity of the option price to the underlying stock (or commodity) price. The delta adjusted basis is the number of shares underlying the option multiplied by the delta and the underlying stock (or commodity) price.

&#160; 

DME Advisors and its affiliates manage and expect to manage other client accounts besides ours, some of which have, or may have, objectives similar to ours. Because of the similarity or potential similarity of our investment portfolio to these other client accounts, and because, as a matter of ordinary course, DME Advisors and its affiliates provide their clients, including us, with results of their respective investment portfolios on the last day of each month, those other clients indirectly may have material non-public information regarding our investment portfolio. To address this issue, and to comply with Regulation FD, we present, prior to the start of trading on the first business day of each month, our largest disclosed long positions, a summary of our consolidated net investment returns, information on our long and short exposures and from time to time certain other material information relating to our investment portfolio, on our website, www.greenlightre.ky. DME Advisors may choose not to disclose certain positions to its clients in order to protect its investment strategy. Therefore, we present on our website the largest positions held by us that are disclosed by DME Advisors or its affiliates to their other clients. 

Internal Risk Management 

&#160; 

Our risk manager is responsible for the construct and review of our internal risk management function. We review our investment portfolio together with our reinsurance operations on a periodic basis to ensure that we have sufficient capital to withstand losses on either or both of our investment and reinsurance portfolios under stressed scenarios. With the assistance of DME Advisors, we periodically analyze both our assets and liabilities including the numerous components of risk in our portfolio, such as concentration risk and liquidity risk. 

Information Technology 

Our information technology infrastructure is currently housed in our corporate offices in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands. We have implemented backup procedures to ensure that data is backed up on a daily basis and can be restored in an appropriate time frame as needed. 

&#160; 

We have a disaster recovery plan with respect to our information technology infrastructure that includes data and systems replication between our Cayman Islands office and Dublin office and other off-site locations. We believe we can access our core systems with insignificant outages and restore operation of our secondary systems in the event that our primary systems are unavailable due to a disaster or otherwise. 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 30 &#32;full-time employees, 25 &#32;of whom were based in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands and 5 &#32;were based in Dublin, Ireland. We believe that our employee relations are good. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, and we are not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements.
