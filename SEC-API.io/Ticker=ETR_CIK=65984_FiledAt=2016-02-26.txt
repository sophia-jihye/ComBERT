ENTERGY&#8217;S BUSINESS 

Entergy is an integrated energy company engaged primarily in electric power production and retail distribution operations. Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 30,000 MW of electric generating capacity, including nearly 10,000 MW of nuclear power. Entergy delivers electricity to 2.8 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Entergy had annual revenues of $11.5 billion in 2015 and had more than 13,000 employees as of December 31, 2015. 

Entergy operates primarily through two business segments: Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 

&#8226; 

The Utility &#32;business segment includes the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric power in portions of Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana, including the City of New Orleans; and operation of a small natural gas distribution business. 

&#8226; 

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities &#32;business segment includes the ownership, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants located in the northern United States and the sale of the electric power produced by its operating plants to wholesale customers. On December 29, 2014, the Vermont Yankee plant ceased power production and entered its decommissioning phase. In October 2015, Entergy determined that it will close the Pilgrim plant no later than June 1, 2019 and the FitzPatrick plant at the end of its current fuel cycle, planned for January 27, 2017. Entergy Wholesale Commodities also provides services to other nuclear power plant owners and owns interests in non-nuclear power plants that sell the electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers. 

See Note 13 to the financial statements for financial information regarding Entergy&#8217;s business segments. 

Strategy 

Entergy&#8217;s mission is to operate a world-class energy business that creates sustainable value for its owners, customers, employees, and communities. Entergy aspires to achieve top quartile total shareholder returns in a socially and environmentally responsible fashion by leveraging the scale and expertise inherent in its core utility and nuclear operations. Entergy&#8217;s current scope includes electricity generation, transmission, and distribution as well as natural gas distribution. Entergy focuses on operational excellence with an emphasis on safety, reliability, customer service, sustainability, cost efficiency, risk management, and engaged employees. Entergy also continually seeks opportunities to grow its utility business to benefit all stakeholders and to optimize its portfolio of assets in an ever-dynamic market through periodic buy, build, hold, or disposal decisions. To accomplish this, Entergy has established strategic imperatives for each business segment. For the Utility, the strategic imperative is to modernize its operations and maintain reliability, and for Entergy Wholesale Commodities, the strategic imperative is to manage the risk in the business. 

Utility 

&#160; 

The Utility business segment includes five wholly-owned retail electric utility subsidiaries: Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas. These companies generate, transmit, distribute and sell electric power to retail and wholesale customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans also provide natural gas utility services to customers in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and New Orleans, Louisiana, respectively. Also included in the Utility is System Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation that owns or leases 90 percent of Grand Gulf. System Energy sells its power and capacity from Grand Gulf at wholesale to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. The five retail utility subsidiaries are each regulated by the FERC and by state utility commissions, or, in the case of Entergy New Orleans, the City Council. System Energy is regulated by the FERC because all of its transactions are at wholesale. The overall generation portfolio of the Utility, which relies heavily on natural gas and nuclear generation, is consistent with Entergy&#8217;s strong support for the environment.

Retail Rate Regulation 

General &#32;(Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 

Each Utility operating company regularly participates in retail rate proceedings. The status of material retail rate proceedings is described in Note 2 to the financial statements. Certain aspects of the Utility operating companies&#8217; retail rate mechanisms are discussed below. 

Entergy Arkansas 

Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery 

Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased power costs in monthly bills. The rider utilizes prior calendar year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy cost for the prior calendar year. The energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs. In December 2007 the APSC issued an order stating that Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s energy cost recovery rider will remain in effect, and any future termination of the rider would be subject to eighteen months advance notice by the APSC, which would occur following notice and hearing. 

Storm Cost Recovery 

See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of proceedings regarding recovery of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s storm restoration costs. 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

Entergy Louisiana 

Fuel Recovery 

Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s rate schedules include a fuel adjustment clause designed to recover the cost of fuel and purchased power costs. The fuel adjustment clause contains a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense and related carrying charges arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of proceedings related to audits of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s fuel adjustment clause filings. 

To help stabilize electricity costs, Entergy Louisiana received approval from the LPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial instruments. Entergy Louisiana hedges approximately one-third of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its native electric load for all months of the year. The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis. 

Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s gas rates include a purchased gas adjustment clause based on estimated gas costs for the billing month adjusted by a surcharge or credit that arises from an annual reconciliation of fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. 

To help stabilize retail gas costs, Entergy Louisiana received approval from the LPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility for its gas purchased for resale through the use of financial instruments. Entergy Louisiana hedges approximately one-half of the projected natural gas volumes used to serve its natural gas customers for November through March. The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis. 

Storm Cost Recovery 

See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s filings to recover storm-related costs. 

Entergy Mississippi 

Fuel Recovery 

Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s rate schedules include energy cost recovery riders to recover fuel and purchased power costs. The energy cost rate for each calendar year is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery of the energy costs as of the 12-month period ended September 30. Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC. 

Power Management Rider 

In November 2005 the MPSC approved the purchase of the Attala power plant and recovery of the investment cost through Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s power management rider. Entergy Mississippi recovered the annual ownership costs of the Attala plant through the power management rider until resolution of its general rate case. In 2012 the MPSC approved the purchase of the Hinds power plant recovery of the investment cost through Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s power management rider. Entergy Mississippi recovered the annual ownership costs of the Hinds plant through the power management rider until resolution of its general rate case. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s 2014 general rate case. Included in the rate changes and revenue adjustments effective with February 2015 bills was the realignment of the annual ownership costs associated with the Attala plant and the Hinds plant from the power management rider to base rates. 

To help stabilize electricity costs, Entergy Mississippi received approval from the MPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial instruments. Entergy Mississippi hedges approximately one- 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

third of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its native electric load for all months of the year. The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis. 

Storm Cost Recovery 

See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of proceedings regarding recovery of Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s storm-related costs. 

Entergy New Orleans 

Fuel Recovery 

Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s electric rate schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. 

Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s gas rate schedules include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges. In October 2005 the City Council approved modification of the current gas cost collection mechanism effective November 2005 in order to address concerns regarding its fluctuations, particularly during the winter heating season. The modifications are intended to minimize fluctuations in gas rates during the winter months. 

To help stabilize gas costs, Entergy New Orleans seeks approval annually from the City Council to continue implementation of its natural gas hedging program consistent with the City Council&#8217;s stated policy objectives. The program uses financial instruments to hedge exposure to volatility in the wholesale price of natural gas purchased to serve Entergy New Orleans gas customers. Entergy New Orleans hedges up to 25% of actual gas sales made during the winter months. 

Storm Cost Recovery 

See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s efforts to recover storm-related costs. 

Entergy Texas 

Fuel Recovery 

Entergy Texas&#8217;s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including interest, that are not included in base rates. Semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor are made in March and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix. The amounts collected under Entergy Texas&#8217;s fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the PUCT. The PUCT fuel cost proceedings are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. 

Electric Industry Restructuring 

In June 2009, a law was enacted in Texas that required Entergy Texas to cease all activities relating to Entergy Texas&#8217;s transition to competition. The law allows Entergy Texas to remain a part of the SERC Region, although it does not prevent Entergy Texas from joining another power region. The law provides that proceedings to certify a power region that Entergy Texas belongs to as a qualified power region can be initiated by the PUCT, or on motion by another party, when the conditions supporting such a proceeding exist. Under the law, the PUCT may not approve a 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

transition to competition plan for Entergy Texas until the expiration of four years from the PUCT&#8217;s certification of Entergy Texas&#8217;s power region. 

The law also contains provisions that allow Entergy Texas to take advantage of a cost recovery mechanism that permits annual filings for the recovery of reasonable and necessary expenditures for transmission infrastructure improvement and changes in wholesale transmission charges. This mechanism was previously available to other non-ERCOT Texas utility companies, but not to Entergy Texas. 

The law further amended already existing law that had required Entergy Texas to propose for PUCT approval a tariff to allow eligible customers the ability to contract for competitive generation. The amending language in the law provides, among other things, that: 1) the tariff shall not be implemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of manufacturers who choose not to participate in the tariff; 2) Entergy Texas shall &#8220;purchase competitive generation service, selected by the customer, and provide the generation at retail to the customer&#8221;; and 3) Entergy Texas shall provide and price transmission service and ancillary services under that tariff at a rate that is unbundled from its cost of service. The law directs that the PUCT may not issue an order on the tariff that is contrary to an applicable decision, rule, or policy statement of a federal regulatory agency having jurisdiction. 

Entergy Texas and the other parties to the PUCT proceeding to determine the design of the competitive generation tariff were involved in negotiations throughout 2011 and 2012 with the objective of resolving as many disputed issues as possible regarding the tariff. The PUCT determined that unrecovered costs that could be recovered through the rider consist only of those costs necessary to implement and administer the competitive generation program and do not include lost revenues or embedded generation costs. The PUCT also ruled that the amount of customer load that may be included in the competitive generation service program is limited to 115 MW. After additional negotiations, and ultimately the scheduling of a hearing to resolve remaining contested issues, the PUCT issued the order approving the competitive generation service rider in July 2013. Entergy Texas filed for rehearing of the PUCT&#8217;s July 2013 order, which the PUCT denied. Entergy Texas has since filed its appeal of that PUCT order to the Travis County District Court, which found in favor of the PUCT in an order issued in October 2014. In November 2014, Entergy Texas appealed the District Court&#8217;s order which moves the appeal to the Third Court of Appeals. Entergy Texas and opposing parties filed briefs and responses in the first quarter 2015. Oral argument was held in May 2015. The appeal remains pending. 

In September 2011 the PUCT adopted a proposed rule implementing a distribution cost recovery factor to recover capital and capital-related costs related to distribution infrastructure. The distribution cost recovery factor permits utilities once per year to implement an increase or decrease in rates above or below amounts reflected in base rates to reflect depreciation expense, federal income tax and other taxes, and return on investment. The distribution cost recovery factor rider may be changed a maximum of four times between base rate cases, and expires in September 2019, unless otherwise extended by the Texas Legislature. 

Franchises 

Entergy Arkansas holds exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 308 incorporated cities and towns in Arkansas. These franchises are unlimited in duration and continue unless the municipalities purchase the utility property. In Arkansas franchises are considered to be contracts and, therefore, are terminable pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement and applicable statutes. 

Entergy Louisiana holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 175 incorporated municipalities and in the unincorporated areas of approximately 59 parishes of Louisiana. Entergy Louisiana holds non-exclusive franchises to provide natural gas service to customers in the City of Baton Rouge and in East Baton Rouge Parish. Municipal franchise agreement terms range from 25 to 60 years while parish franchise terms range from 25 to 99 years. 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

Entergy Mississippi has received from the MPSC certificates of public convenience and necessity to provide electric service to areas within 45 counties, including a number of municipalities, in western Mississippi. Under Mississippi statutory law, such certificates are exclusive. Entergy Mississippi may continue to serve in such municipalities upon payment of a statutory franchise fee, regardless of whether an original municipal franchise is still in existence. 

Entergy New Orleans provides electric and gas service in the City of New Orleans pursuant to indeterminate permits set forth in city ordinances. These ordinances contain a continuing option for the City of New Orleans to purchase Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s electric and gas utility properties. 

Entergy Texas holds a certificate of convenience and necessity from the PUCT to provide electric service to areas within approximately 27 counties in eastern Texas, and holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 68 incorporated municipalities. Entergy Texas typically obtains 25-year franchise agreements as existing agreements expire. Entergy Texas&#8217;s electric franchises expire during 2016-2058. 

The business of System Energy is limited to wholesale power sales. It has no distribution franchises.

(a) 

&#8220;Owned and Leased Capability&#8221; is the dependable load carrying capability as demonstrated under actual operating conditions based on the primary fuel (assuming no curtailments) that each station was designed to utilize. 

Summer peak load for the Utility has averaged 21,604 MW over the previous decade. The Utility operating companies, in aggregate, are projected to have approximately 200 MW more than their minimum capacity requirements needed to meet MISO Resource Adequacy for 2016. 

The Utility operating companies&#8217; load and capacity projections are reviewed periodically to assess the need and timing for additional generating capacity and interconnections. These reviews consider existing and projected demand, and the availability and price of power, the location of new load, the economy, and the age and condition of Entergy&#8217;s existing infrastructure. The resource planning processes also considers Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s exit from the System Agreement on December 18, 2013, Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s exit from the System Agreement on November 7, 2015, as well as the termination of the System Agreement at the end of August 2016 for the remainder of the Utility operating companies. 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

The Utility operating companies&#8217; long-term resource strategy, the &#8220;Portfolio Transformation Strategy,&#8221; calls for the bulk of capacity needs to be met through long-term resources, whether owned or contracted. Over the past decade, the Portfolio Transformation Strategy has resulted in the addition of about 5,700 MW of new long-term resources. As MISO market participants, the Utility operating companies also participate in MISO&#8217;s Day Ahead and Real Time Energy and Ancillary Services markets to economically dispatch generation and purchase energy to serve customers reliably and at the lowest reasonable cost. 

RFP Procurements 

The Utility operating companies from time to time issue requests for proposals (RFP) to procure supply-side resources from sources other than the spot market to meet the unique regional needs of the Utility operating companies. The RFPs issued by the Utility operating companies have sought resources needed to meet near-term MISO reliability requirements as well as longer-term requirements through a broad range of wholesale power products, including limited-term (1 to 3 years) and long-term contractual products and asset acquisitions. The RFP process has resulted, in the selection or acquisition of the following, including among other things, in: 

&#8226; 

Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s June 2005 purchase of the 718 MW, gas-fired Perryville plant, of which 35% of the output is sold to Entergy Texas; 

&#8226; 

Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s September 2008 purchase of the 789 MW, combined-cycle, gas-fired Ouachita Generating Facility. Entergy Louisiana, as successor in interest to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, owns one-third of the facility; 

&#8226; 

Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s November 2012 purchase of the 620 MW, combined-cycle, gas-fired Hot Spring Energy facility; 

&#8226; 

Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s November 2012 purchase of the 450 MW, combined-cycle, gas-fired Hinds Energy facility; and 

&#8226; 

Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s construction of the 560 MW, combined-cycle, gas turbine Ninemile 6 generating facility at its existing Ninemile Point electric generating station. The facility reached commercial operation in December 2014. 

The selection of the St. Charles Power Station self-build project from the 2014 Amite South RFP, issued on behalf of Entergy Louisiana, is currently going through the regulatory approval process and, subject to such approval, full notice to proceed is expected to be issued in Summer 2016. Commercial operation is estimated to occur by Summer 2019. 

The RFP process has also resulted in the selection, or confirmation of the economic merits of, long-term purchased power agreements (PPAs), including, among others: 

&#8226;

This RFP is seeking up to 1,000 MW for developmental and/or existing resources beginning in June 2020. This RFP includes a self-build option at Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s Nelson site. 

In December 2015, Entergy Services, on behalf of Entergy Louisiana, issued notice of intent to issue a RFP for Renewable Resources. This RFP will seek up to 200 MW of renewable resources to identify potentially cost-effective renewable resources that can provide fuel diversity and other benefits to customers. 

Other Procurements From Third Parties 

The Utility operating companies have also made resource acquisitions outside of the RFP process, including Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s January 2006 acquisition of the 480 MW, combined-cycle, gas-fired Attala power plant; Entergy Gulf States Louisiana&#8217;s March 2008 acquisition of the 322 MW, simple-cycle, gas-fired Calcasieu Generating Facility; and Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s April 2011 acquisition of the 580 MW, combined-cycle, gas-fired Acadia Energy Center Unit 2. The Utility operating companies have also entered into various limited- and long-term contracts in recent years as a result of bilateral negotiations. 

In December 2014, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and Entergy Texas entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the Union Power Station, a 1,980 MW (summer rating) power generation facility located near El Dorado, Arkansas, from Union Power Partners, L.P. The Union Power Station consists of four natural gas-fired, combined-cycle gas turbine power blocks, each rated at 495 MW (summer rating). Pursuant to the original agreement, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will acquire two of the power blocks and a 50% undivided ownership interest 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

in certain assets related to the facility, and Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas would each acquire one power block and a 25% undivided ownership interest in the related assets. Entergy Texas subsequently chose to withdraw its certification filing for the purchase of one of the power blocks at the Union Power Station. In July 2015 the PUCT approved Entergy Texas&#8217;s withdrawal. Following Entergy Texas&#8217;s withdrawal, the power block was reallocated to Entergy New Orleans. Additionally, the business combination of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana received regulatory approval and closed in October 2015 making Entergy Louisiana the named purchaser of two of the power blocks at the Union Power Station. The base purchase price is expected to be approximately $948 million (approximately $237 million for each power block) subject to adjustments. The purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals, including cost recovery, from various federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. These include regulatory approvals from the APSC, LPSC, CNO, and FERC, as well as clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust law. As of early January 2016, each of the Entergy's Utility operating companies involved in the purchase agreement has received retail regulatory approvals from their respective retail regulator. Closing of the purchase is expected to be completed promptly following the receipt of FERC approval. 

Interconnections 

The Utility operating companies&#8217; generating units are interconnected by a transmission system operating at various voltages up to 500 kV. These generating units consist primarily of steam-electric production facilities and are provided dispatch instructions by MISO. Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies are MISO market participants and are interconnected with many neighboring utilities. MISO is an essential link in the safe, cost-effective delivery of electric power across all or parts of 15 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Manitoba. As a Regional Transmission Organization, MISO assures consumers of unbiased regional grid management and open access to the transmission facilities under MISO&#8217;s functional supervision. In addition, the Utility operating companies are members of the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC). SERC is a nonprofit corporation responsible for promoting and improving the reliability, adequacy, and critical infrastructure of the bulk power supply systems in all or portions of 16 central and southeastern states. &#32;&#32; SERC serves as a regional entity with delegated authority from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) for the purpose of proposing and enforcing reliability standards within the SERC Region. 

Gas Property 

As of December 31, 2015 , Entergy New Orleans distributed and transported natural gas for distribution within New Orleans, Louisiana, through approximately 2,500 miles of gas pipeline. As of December 31, 2015, the gas properties of Entergy Louisiana, which are located in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were not material to Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s financial position. 

Title 

The Utility operating companies&#8217; generating stations are generally located on properties owned in fee simple. Most of the substations and transmission and distribution lines are constructed on private property or public rights-of-way pursuant to easements, servitudes, or appropriate franchises. Some substation properties are owned in fee simple. The Utility operating companies generally have the right of eminent domain, whereby they may perfect title to, or secure easements or servitudes on, private property for their utility operations. 

Substantially all of the physical properties and assets owned by Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy are subject to the liens of mortgages securing bonds issued by those companies. The Lewis Creek generating station is owned by GSG&#38;T, Inc., a subsidiary of Entergy Texas, and is not subject to its mortgage lien. Lewis Creek is leased to and operated by Entergy Texas.

Hydroelectric power provided less than 1% of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s generation in 2015 and is expected to provide 1% of its generation in 2016. 

(b) 

Capacity and energy from System Energy&#8217;s interest in Grand Gulf is allocated as follows under the Unit Power Sales Agreement: Entergy Arkansas - 36%; Entergy Louisiana - 14%; Entergy Mississippi - 33%; and Entergy New Orleans - 17%. Pursuant to purchased power agreements, Entergy Arkansas is selling a portion of its owned capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. 

Some of the Utility&#8217;s gas-fired plants are capable of also using fuel oil, if necessary. In addition, two small peaking units burn only oil. Any oil use is included in the total for gas. 

Natural Gas 

The Utility operating companies have long-term firm and short-term interruptible gas contracts for both supply and transportation. Long-term firm contracts for power plants comprise less than 25% of the Utility operating companies&#8217; total requirements. Short-term contracts and spot-market purchases satisfy additional gas requirements. Entergy Texas owns a gas storage facility that provides reliable and flexible natural gas service to certain generating stations. 

Many factors, including wellhead deliverability, storage, pipeline capacity, and demand requirements of end users, influence the availability and price of natural gas supplies for power plants. Demand is tied to weather conditions as well as to the prices and availability of other energy sources. Pursuant to federal and state regulations, gas supplies to power plants may be interrupted during periods of shortage. To the extent natural gas supplies are disrupted or 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

natural gas prices significantly increase, the Utility operating companies will use alternate fuels, such as oil, or rely to a larger extent on coal, nuclear generation, and purchased power. 

Coal 

Entergy Arkansas has committed to five one- to three-year contracts that will supply approximately 85% of the total coal supply needs in 2016. These contracts are staggered in term so that not all contracts have to be renewed the same year. The remaining 15% of total coal requirements will be satisfied by contracts with a term of less than one year. Based on continued improved Powder River Basin (PRB) coal deliveries by rail and the high cost of alternate sources and modes of transportation, no alternative coal consumption is expected at Entergy Arkansas during 2016. Coal will be transported to Arkansas via an existing transportation agreement that is expected to provide all of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s rail transportation requirements for 2016. 

Entergy Louisiana has committed to three one- to three-year contracts that will supply approximately all of Nelson Unit 6 coal needs in 2016. If needed, additional PRB coal will be purchased through contracts with a term of less than one year to provide the remaining supply needs. For the same reasons as for Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s plants, no alternative coal consumption is expected at Nelson Unit 6 during 2016. Coal will be transported to Nelson via an existing transportation agreement that is expected to provide all of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s rail transportation requirements for 2016. 

For the year 2015, coal transportation delivery to Entergy Arkansas- and Entergy Louisiana-operated coal-fired units exceeded coal demand at the plants and it is expected that delivery times experienced in 2015 will continue to be adequate through 2016. Both Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana control a sufficient number of railcars to satisfy the rail transportation requirement. 

The operator of Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3, Louisiana Generating, LLC, has advised Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas that it has adequate rail car and barge capacity to meet the volumes of PRB coal requested for 2016. Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s and Entergy Texas&#8217;s coal nomination requests to Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3 are made on an annual basis. 

Nuclear Fuel 

The nuclear fuel cycle consists of the following: 

&#8226; 

mining and milling of uranium ore to produce a concentrate; 

&#8226; 

conversion of the concentrate to uranium hexafluoride gas; 

&#8226; 

enrichment of the uranium hexafluoride gas; 

&#8226; 

fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies for use in fueling nuclear reactors; and 

&#8226; 

disposal of spent fuel. 

The Registrant Subsidiaries that own nuclear plants, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, are responsible through a shared regulated uranium pool for contracts to acquire nuclear material to be used in fueling Entergy&#8217;s Utility nuclear units. These companies own the materials and services in this shared regulated uranium pool on a pro rata fractional basis determined by the nuclear generation capability of each company. Any liabilities for obligations of the pooled contracts are on a several but not joint basis. The shared regulated uranium pool maintains inventories of nuclear materials during the various stages of processing. The Registrant Subsidiaries purchase enriched uranium hexafluoride for their nuclear plant reload requirements at the average inventory cost from the shared regulated uranium pool. Entergy Operations Inc. contracts separately for the fabrication of nuclear fuel as agent on behalf of each of the Registrant Subsidiaries that owns a nuclear plant. All contracts for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel are between the DOE and the owner of a nuclear power plant. 

Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, the nuclear units in both the Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities segments have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable or fixed prices through most of 2016 or beyond. The nuclear fuel supply portfolio for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment is being adjusted to reflect reduced overall requirements related to the planned permanent shutdowns of the FitzPatrick and Pilgrim plants. Entergy&#8217;s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners. There are a number of possible supply alternatives that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, including potentially drawing upon Entergy&#8217;s inventory intended for later generation periods depending upon its risk management strategy at that time, although the pricing of any alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. In addition, some nuclear fuel contracts are on a non-fixed price basis subject to prevailing prices at the time of delivery. 

The effects of market price changes may be reduced and deferred by risk management strategies, such as negotiation of floor and ceiling amounts for long-term contracts, buying for inventory or entering into forward physical contracts at fixed prices when Entergy believes it is appropriate and useful. Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. 

Entergy&#8217;s ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers. There are fewer of these providers than for uranium. For conversion and enrichment services, like uranium, Entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures as needed to ensure supply of enriched uranium for the reliable fabrication of nuclear fuel. For fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the effective performance of the fabricator of that plant&#8217;s nuclear fuel, therefore, Entergy provides additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight for the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality. 

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy each have made arrangements to lease nuclear fuel and related equipment and services. The lessors, which are consolidated in the financial statements of Entergy and the applicable Registrant Subsidiary, finance the acquisition and ownership of nuclear fuel through credit agreements and the issuance of notes. These credit facilities are subject to periodic renewal, and the notes are issued periodically, typically for terms between three and ten years. 

Natural Gas Purchased for Resale 

Entergy New Orleans has several suppliers of natural gas. Its system is interconnected with three interstate and three intrastate pipelines. Entergy New Orleans has a &#8220;no-notice&#8221; service gas purchase contract with Atmos Energy which guarantees Entergy New Orleans gas delivery at specific delivery points and at any volume within the minimum and maximum set forth in the contract amounts. The Atmos Energy gas supply is transported to Entergy New Orleans pursuant to a transportation service agreement with Gulf South Pipeline Co. This service is subject to FERC-approved rates. Entergy New Orleans also makes interruptible spot market purchases. In recent years, natural gas deliveries to Entergy New Orleans have been subject primarily to weather-related curtailments. 

Entergy Louisiana purchased natural gas for resale under a firm contract from Enbridge Marketing (U.S.) Inc. until September 1, 2015. Starting on September 1, 2015 the purchases were from Sequent Energy Management L.P. The gas is delivered through a combination of intrastate and interstate pipelines. 

As a result of the implementation of FERC-mandated interstate pipeline restructuring in 1993, curtailments of interstate gas supply could occur if Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s or Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s suppliers failed to perform their obligations to deliver gas under their supply agreements. Gulf South Pipeline Co. could curtail transportation capacity only in the event of pipeline system constraints. 

Part I Item 1

Federal Regulation of the Utility 

State or local regulatory authorities, as described above, regulate the retail rates of the Utility operating companies. The FERC regulates wholesale rates, including intrasystem sales pursuant to the System Agreement, and interstate transmission of electricity, as well as rates for System Energy&#8217;s sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. 

System Agreement &#32;(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 

The Utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that has been approved by the FERC. Under the terms of the System Agreement, generating capacity and other power resources are jointly operated by the Utility operating companies that are participating in the System Agreement. The System Agreement provides, among other things, that parties having generating reserves greater than their allocated share of reserves (long companies) shall receive payments from those parties having generating reserves that are less than their allocated share of reserves (short companies). Such payments are at amounts sufficient to cover certain of the long companies&#8217; costs for intermediate and peaking oil/gas-fired generation, including operating expenses, fixed charges on debt, dividend requirements on preferred equity, and a fair rate of return on common equity investment. Under the System Agreement, the rates used to compensate long companies are based on costs associated with the long companies&#8217; steam electric generating units fueled by oil or gas and having an annual average heat rate above 10,000 Btu/kWh. In addition, for all energy exchanged among the Utility operating companies under the System Agreement, the companies purchasing exchange energy are required to pay the cost of fuel consumed in generating such energy plus a charge to cover other associated costs. Entergy Arkansas terminated its participation in the System Agreement in December 2013. Entergy Mississippi terminated its participation in the System Agreement in November 2015. The System Agreement will terminate with respect to its remaining participants on August 31, 2016.

System Energy and Related Agreements 

System Energy recovers costs related to its interest in Grand Gulf through rates charged to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans for capacity and energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement (described below). In December 1995, System Energy commenced a rate proceeding at the FERC. In July 2001 the rate proceeding became final, with the FERC approving a prospective 10.94% return on equity. The FERC&#8217;s decision also affected other aspects of System Energy&#8217;s charges to the Utility operating companies that it supplies with power. In 1998 the FERC approved requests by Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to accelerate a portion of their Grand Gulf purchased power obligations. Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s and Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s acceleration of Grand Gulf purchased power obligations ceased effective July 2001 and July 2003, respectively, as approved by the FERC. 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

Unit Power Sales Agreement 

The Unit Power Sales Agreement allocates capacity, energy, and the related costs from System Energy&#8217;s ownership and leasehold interests in Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas (36%), Entergy Louisiana (14%), Entergy Mississippi (33%), and Entergy New Orleans (17%). Each of these companies is obligated to make payments to System Energy for its entitlement of capacity and energy on a full cost-of-service basis regardless of the quantity of energy delivered. Payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are System Energy&#8217;s only source of operating revenue. The financial condition of System Energy depends upon the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf and the receipt of such payments. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans generally recover payments made under the Unit Power Sales Agreement through rates charged to their customers. 

In the case of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana, payments are also recovered through sales of electricity from their respective retained shares of Grand Gulf. Under a settlement agreement entered into with the APSC in 1985 and amended in 1988, Entergy Arkansas retains 22% of its 36% share of Grand Gulf-related costs and recovers the remaining 78% of its share in rates. In the event that Entergy Arkansas is not able to sell its retained share to third parties, it may sell such energy to its retail customers at a price equal to its avoided cost, which is currently less than Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s cost from its retained share. Entergy Arkansas has life-of-resources purchased power agreements with Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans that sell a portion of the output of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s retained share of Grand Gulf to those companies, with the remainder of the retained share being sold to Entergy Mississippi through a separate life-of-resources purchased power agreement. In a series of LPSC orders, court decisions, and agreements from late 1985 to mid-1988, Entergy Louisiana was granted rate relief with respect to costs associated with Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s share of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf, subject to certain terms and conditions. Entergy Louisiana retains and does not recover from retail ratepayers 18% of its 14% share of the costs of Grand Gulf capacity and energy and recovers the remaining 82% of its share in rates. Entergy Louisiana is allowed to recover through the fuel adjustment clause at 4.6 cents per kWh for the energy related to its retained portion of these costs. Alternatively, Entergy Louisiana may sell such energy to non-affiliated parties at prices above the fuel adjustment clause recovery amount, subject to the LPSC&#8217;s approval. Entergy Arkansas also has a life-of-resources purchased power agreement with Entergy Mississippi to sell a portion of the output of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s non-retained share of Grand Gulf. Entergy Mississippi was granted rate relief for those purchases by the MPSC through its annual rate mechanism. 

Availability Agreement 

The Availability Agreement among System Energy and Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans was entered into in 1974 in connection with the financing by System Energy of Grand Gulf. The Availability Agreement provides that System Energy make available to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans all capacity and energy available from System Energy&#8217;s share of Grand Gulf. 

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans also agreed severally to pay System Energy monthly for the right to receive capacity and energy from Grand Gulf in amounts that (when added to any amounts received by System Energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement) would at least equal System Energy&#8217;s total operating expenses for Grand Gulf (including depreciation at a specified rate and expenses incurred in a permanent shutdown of Grand Gulf) and interest charges. The September 1989 write-off of System Energy&#8217;s investment in Grand Gulf 2, amounting to approximately $900 million, is being amortized for Availability Agreement purposes over 27 years. 

The allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement are fixed as follows: Entergy Arkansas - 17.1%; Entergy Louisiana - 26.9%; Entergy Mississippi - 31.3%; and Entergy New Orleans - 24.7%. The allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement would remain in effect and would govern payments made under such agreement in the event of a shortfall of funds available to System Energy from other sources, including payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

System Energy has assigned its rights to payments and advances from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans under the Availability Agreement as security for its first mortgage bonds and reimbursement obligations to certain banks providing letters of credit in connection with the equity funding of the sale and leaseback transactions described in Note 10 to the financial statements under &#8220; Sale and Leaseback Transactions &#32;- Grand Gulf Lease Obligations.&#8221; In these assignments, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans further agreed that, in the event they were prohibited by governmental action from making payments under the Availability Agreement (for example, if the FERC reduced or disallowed such payments as constituting excessive rates), they would then make subordinated advances to System Energy in the same amounts and at the same times as the prohibited payments. System Energy would not be allowed to repay these subordinated advances so long as it remained in default under the related indebtedness or in other similar circumstances. 

Each of the assignment agreements relating to the Availability Agreement provides that Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans will make payments directly to System Energy. However, if there is an event of default, those payments must be made directly to the holders of indebtedness that are the beneficiaries of such assignment agreements. The payments must be made pro rata according to the amount of the respective obligations secured. 

The obligations of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans to make payments under the Availability Agreement are subject to the receipt and continued effectiveness of all necessary regulatory approvals. Sales of capacity and energy under the Availability Agreement would require that the Availability Agreement be submitted to the FERC for approval with respect to the terms of such sale. No such filing with the FERC has been made because sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf are being made pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. If, for any reason, sales of capacity and energy are made in the future pursuant to the Availability Agreement, the jurisdictional portions of the Availability Agreement would be submitted to the FERC for approval. 

Since commercial operation of Grand Gulf began, payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to System Energy have exceeded the amounts payable under the Availability Agreement and, therefore, no payments under the Availability Agreement have ever been required. If Entergy Arkansas or Entergy Mississippi fails to make its Unit Power Sales Agreement payments, and System Energy is unable to obtain funds from other sources, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans could become subject to claims or demands by System Energy or its creditors for payments or advances under the Availability Agreement (or the assignments thereof) equal to the difference between their required Unit Power Sales Agreement payments and their required Availability Agreement payments because their Availability Agreement obligations exceed their Unit Power Sales Agreement obligations. 

The Availability Agreement may be terminated, amended, or modified by mutual agreement of the parties thereto, without further consent of any assignees or other creditors. 

Capital Funds Agreement 

System Energy and Entergy Corporation have entered into the Capital Funds Agreement, whereby Entergy Corporation has agreed to supply System Energy with sufficient capital to (i) maintain System Energy&#8217;s equity capital at an amount equal to a minimum of 35% of its total capitalization (excluding short-term debt) and (ii) permit the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf and pay in full all indebtedness for borrowed money of System Energy when due. 

Entergy Corporation has entered into various supplements to the Capital Funds Agreement. System Energy has assigned its rights under such a supplement as security for its one outstanding series of first mortgage bonds. The supplement provides that permitted indebtedness for borrowed money incurred by System Energy in connection with the financing of Grand Gulf may be secured by System Energy&#8217;s rights under the Capital Funds Agreement on a pro rata basis (except for the Specific Payments, as defined below). In addition, in the supplements to the Capital Funds Agreement relating to the specific indebtedness being secured, Entergy Corporation has agreed to make cash capital contributions directly to System Energy sufficient to enable System Energy to make payments when due on such 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

indebtedness (Specific Payments). However, if there is an event of default, Entergy Corporation must make those payments directly to the holders of indebtedness benefiting from the supplemental agreements. The payments (other than the Specific Payments) must be made pro rata according to the amount of the respective obligations benefiting from the supplemental agreements. 

The Capital Funds Agreement may be terminated, amended, or modified by mutual agreement of the parties thereto, upon obtaining the consent, if required, of those holders of System Energy&#8217;s indebtedness then outstanding who have received the assignments of the Capital Funds Agreement. No such consent would be required to terminate the Capital Funds Agreement or the supplement thereto at this time. 

Service Companies 

Entergy Services, a corporation wholly-owned by Entergy Corporation, provides management, administrative, accounting, legal, engineering, and other services primarily to the Utility operating companies, but also provides services to Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Entergy Operations is also wholly-owned by Entergy Corporation and provides nuclear management, operations and maintenance services under contract for ANO, River Bend, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, subject to the owner oversight of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, respectively. Entergy Services and Entergy Operations provide their services to the Utility operating companies and System Energy on an &#8220;at cost&#8221; basis, pursuant to cost allocation methodologies for these service agreements that were approved by the FERC. 

Jurisdictional Separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas 

Effective December 31, 2007, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. completed a jurisdictional separation into two vertically integrated utility companies, one operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the PUCT, Entergy Texas, and the other operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the LPSC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy Texas owns all Entergy Gulf States, Inc. distribution and transmission assets located in Texas, the gas-fired generating plants located in Texas, undivided 42.5% ownership shares of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.&#8217;s 70% ownership interest in Nelson 6 and 42% ownership interest in Big Cajun 2, Unit 3, which are coal-fired generating plants located in Louisiana, and other assets and contract rights to the extent related to utility operations in Texas. Entergy Louisiana, as successor in interest to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, owns all of the remaining assets that were owned by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. On a book value basis, approximately 58.1% of the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. assets were allocated to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and approximately 41.9% were allocated to Entergy Texas. 

Entergy Texas purchases from Entergy Louisiana pursuant to a life-of-unit purchased power agreement a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the 70% of River Bend subject to retail regulation. Entergy Texas was allocated a share of River Bend&#8217;s nuclear and environmental liabilities that is identical to the share of the plant&#8217;s output purchased by Entergy Texas under the purchased power agreement. Entergy Louisiana purchases a 57.5% share of capacity and energy from the gas-fired generating plants owned by Entergy Texas, and Entergy Texas purchases a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the gas-fired generating plants owned by Entergy Louisiana. The purchased power agreements associated with the gas-fired generating plants will terminate when the unit(s) is/are removed from Entergy System dispatch. The dispatch and operation of the generating plants did not change as a result of the jurisdictional separation. Under the terms of a settlement agreement related to System Agreement termination effective August 31, 2016, the purchased power agreements will also terminate at that time. See additional discussion of the purchased power agreements in &#8220; System Agreement &#32;- Utility Operating Company Notices of Termination of System Agreement Participation&#8221; in the &#8220; Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation &#32;- Federal Regulation &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis. 

Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Business Combination 

On October 1, 2015, the businesses formerly conducted by Entergy Louisiana (Old Entergy Louisiana) and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana (Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana) were combined into a single public utility. In order 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

to effect the business combination, under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Old Entergy Louisiana allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary, Entergy Louisiana Power, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (New Entergy Louisiana), and New Entergy Louisiana assumed the liabilities of Old Entergy Louisiana, in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC. Under the TXBOC, Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary (New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana) and New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana assumed the liabilities of Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC. New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana then merged into New Entergy Louisiana with New Entergy Louisiana surviving the merger. Thereupon, Old Entergy Louisiana changed its name from &#8220;Entergy Louisiana, LLC&#8221; to &#8220;EL Investment Company, LLC&#8221; and New Entergy Louisiana changed its name from &#8220;Entergy Louisiana Power, LLC&#8221; to &#8220;Entergy Louisiana, LLC&#8221; (Entergy Louisiana). With the completion of the business combination, Entergy Louisiana holds substantially all of the assets, and has assumed the liabilities, of Old Entergy Louisiana and Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the business combination.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities 

Entergy Wholesale Commodities includes the ownership, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants, located in the northern United States and the sale of the electric power produced by its operating plants to wholesale customers. Entergy Wholesale Commodities revenues are primarily derived from sales of energy and generation capacity from these plants. Entergy Wholesale Commodities also provides operations and management services, including decommissioning services, to nuclear power plants owned by other utilities in the United States. Entergy Wholesale Commodities also includes the ownership of, or participation in joint ventures that own, non-nuclear power plants and the sale to wholesale customers of the electric power produced by these plants. 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

On December 29, 2014, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; Vermont Yankee plant was removed from the grid, after 42 years of operations. The decision to close and decommission Vermont Yankee was announced in August 2013, as a result of numerous issues including sustained low natural gas and wholesale energy prices, the high cost structure of the plant, and lack of a market structure that adequately compensates merchant nuclear plants for their environmental and fuel diversity benefits in the Northeast region. 

In October 2015, Entergy determined that it will close the FitzPatrick plant at the end of the current fuel cycle, planned for January 27, 2017, because of poor market conditions that have led to decreased revenues, a poor market design that fails to properly compensate nuclear generators for the benefits they provide, and increased operational costs. The decision came after management&#8217;s extensive analysis of whether it was advisable economically to refuel the plant as scheduled in the fall of 2016. 

In October 2015, Entergy determined that it will close the Pilgrim plant no later than June 1, 2019 because of poor market conditions that have led to reduced revenues, a poor market design that fails to properly compensate nuclear generators for the benefits they provide, and increased operational costs. The decision came after management&#8217;s extensive analysis of the economics and operating life of the plant following the NRC&#8217;s decision in September 2015 to place the plant in Column 4 of the Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix. 

In December 2015, Entergy Wholesale Commodities closed on the sale of its 583 MW Rhode Island State Energy Center (RISEC), in Johnston, Rhode Island. The base sales price, excluding adjustments, was approximately $490 million. Entergy Wholesale Commodities purchased RISEC for $346 million in December 2011. The sale was consistent with Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; strategy of freeing financial resources and risk reduction of its portfolio.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities also includes the ownership of two non-operating nuclear facilities, Big Rock Point in Michigan and Indian Point 1 in New York that were acquired when Entergy purchased the Palisades and Indian Point 2 nuclear plants, respectively. These facilities are in various stages of the decommissioning process. 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

In April 2007, Entergy submitted to the NRC a joint application to renew the operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 for an additional 20 years. The original expiration dates of the NRC operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 were September 28, 2013 and December 12, 2015, respectively. Authorization to operate Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 rests on Entergy&#8217;s having timely filed a license renewal application that remains pending before the NRC. Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 have now entered their &#8220;period of extended operation&#8221; after expiration of the plants&#8217; initial license term under &#8220;timely renewal,&#8221; which is a federal statutory rule of general applicability providing for extension of a license for which a renewal application has been timely filed with the licensing agency until the license renewal process has been completed. The license renewal application for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 qualifies for timely renewal protection because it met NRC regulatory standards for timely filing. For additional discussion of the license renewal applications, see &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Authorizations to Operate Its Nuclear Plants &#8221; in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis.

(c) 

Indirectly owned through interests in unconsolidated joint ventures. 

Independent System Operators 

The Pilgrim plant falls under the authority of the Independent System Operator (ISO) New England and the FitzPatrick and Indian Point plants fall under the authority of the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). The Palisades plant falls under the authority of the MISO. The primary purpose of ISO New England, NYISO, and MISO is to direct the operations of the major generation and transmission facilities in their respective regions; ensure grid reliability; administer and monitor wholesale electricity markets; and plan for their respective region&#8217;s energy needs. 

Energy and Capacity Sales 

As a wholesale generator, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; core business is selling energy, measured in MWh, to its customers. Entergy Wholesale Commodities enters into forward contracts with its customers and sells energy in the day ahead or spot markets. In addition to selling the energy produced by its plants, Entergy Wholesale Commodities sells unforced capacity, which allows load-serving entities to meet specified reserve and related requirements placed on them by the ISOs in their respective areas. Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; forward fixed price power contracts consist of contracts to sell energy only, contracts to sell capacity only, and bundled contracts in which it sells both capacity and energy. While the terminology and payment mechanics vary in these contracts, each of these types of contracts requires Entergy Wholesale Commodities to deliver MWh of energy, make capacity available, 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

or both. See &#8220; Market and Credit Risk Sensitive Instruments &#8221; in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for additional information regarding these contracts. 

As part of the purchase of the Palisades plant in 2007, Entergy executed a 15-year PPA with the seller, Consumers Energy, for 100% of the plant&#8217;s output, excluding any future uprates. Under the purchased power agreement, Consumers Energy receives the value of any new environmental credits for the first ten years of the agreement. Palisades and Consumers Energy will share on a 50/50 basis the value of any new environmental credits for years 11 through 15 of the agreement. The environmental credits are defined as benefits from a change in law that causes capability of the plant as of the purchase date to become a tradable attribute (e.g., emission credit, renewable energy credit, environmental credit, &#8220;green&#8221; credit, etc.) or otherwise to have a market value. 

Customers 

Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; customers for the sale of both energy and capacity from its nuclear plants include retail power providers, utilities, electric power co-operatives, power trading organizations, and other power generation companies. These customers include Consolidated Edison and Consumers Energy, companies from which Entergy purchased plants, and ISO New England, NYISO, and MISO. Substantially all of the credit exposure associated with the planned energy output under contract for Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants is with counterparties or their guarantors that have public investment grade credit ratings. 

Competition 

The ISO New England and NYISO markets are highly competitive. Entergy Wholesale Commodities has numerous competitors in New England and New York, including generation companies affiliated with regulated utilities, other independent power producers, municipal and co-operative generators, owners of co-generation plants and wholesale power marketers. Entergy Wholesale Commodities is an independent power producer, which means it generates power for sale to third parties at day ahead or spot market prices to the extent that the power is not sold under a fixed price contract. Municipal and co-operative generators also generate power but use most of it to deliver power to their municipal or co-operative power customers. Owners of co-generation plants produce power primarily for their own consumption. Wholesale power marketers do not own generation; rather they buy power from generators or other market participants and resell it to retail providers or other market participants. Competition in the New England and New York power markets is affected by, among other factors, the amount of generation and transmission capacity in these markets. MISO does not have a centralized clearing capacity market, but load serving entities do meet the majority of their capacity needs through bilateral contracts and self-supply with a smaller portion coming through voluntary MISO auctions. The majority of Palisades&#8217; current output is contracted to Consumers Energy through 2022 and, therefore, Entergy Wholesale Commodities does not expect to be materially affected by competition in the MISO market in the near term. 

Seasonality 

Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; revenues and operating income are subject to fluctuations during the year due to seasonal factors, weather conditions, and contract pricing. Refueling outages are generally scheduled for the spring and the fall, and cause volumetric decreases during those seasons. When outdoor and cooling water temperatures are lower, generally during colder months, Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants operate more efficiently, and consequently, generate more electricity. Many of Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; contracts provide for shaped pricing over the course of the year. As a result of these factors, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; revenues are typically higher in the first and third quarters than in the second and fourth quarters.

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

Fuel Supply 

Nuclear Fuel 

See &#8220; Fuel Supply &#32;- Nuclear Fuel &#8221; in the Utility portion of Part I, Item 1 for a discussion of the nuclear fuel cycle and markets. Entergy Nuclear Fuels Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary, is responsible for contracts to acquire nuclear materials, except for fuel fabrication, for Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, while Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. acts as the agent for the purchase of nuclear fuel assembly fabrication services. All contracts for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel are between the DOE and each of the nuclear power plants. 

Other Business Activities 

Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC (ENPM) was formed in 2005 to centralize the power marketing function for Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants. Upon its formation, ENPM entered into long-term power purchase agreements with the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries that own nuclear power plants (generating subsidiaries). As part of a series of agreements, ENPM agreed to assume and/or otherwise service the existing power purchase agreements that were in effect between the generating subsidiaries and their customers. ENPM&#8217;s functions include origination of new energy and capacity transactions and generation scheduling. 

Entergy Nuclear, Inc. pursues service agreements with other nuclear power plant owners who seek the advantages of Entergy&#8217;s scale and expertise but do not necessarily want to sell their assets. Services provided by either Entergy Nuclear, Inc. or other Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries include engineering, operations and maintenance, fuel procurement, management and supervision, technical support and training, administrative support, and other managerial or technical services required to operate, maintain, and decommission nuclear electric power facilities. Entergy Nuclear, Inc. provided decommissioning services for the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant and continues to pursue opportunities for Entergy Wholesale Commodities with other nuclear plant owners through operating agreements. 

TLG Services, a subsidiary of Entergy Nuclear Inc., offers decommissioning, engineering, and related services to nuclear power plant owners. 

In September 2003, Entergy agreed to provide plant operation support services for the 800 MW Cooper Nuclear Station located near Brownville, Nebraska. The original contract was to expire in 2014 corresponding to the original operating license life of the plant. In 2006 an Entergy subsidiary signed an agreement to provide license renewal services for the Cooper Nuclear Station. The Cooper Nuclear Station received its license renewal from the NRC in November 2010. Entergy continues to provide implementation services for the renewed license. In 2010 an Entergy subsidiary signed an agreement to extend the management support services to Cooper Nuclear Station by 15 years, through January 2029.

The Federal Power Act gives the FERC jurisdiction over the rates charged by System Energy for Grand Gulf capacity and energy provided to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans and over some of the rates charged by Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana. The FERC also regulates the provisions of the System Agreement, including the rates, and the provision of transmission service to wholesale market participants. The FERC also regulates the MISO RTO, an independent entity that maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy, capacity, and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies. FERC regulation of the MISO RTO includes regulation of the design and implementation of the wholesale markets administered by the MISO RTO, as well as the rates, terms, and conditions of open access transmission service over the member systems and the allocation of costs associated with transmission upgrades. 

Entergy Arkansas holds a FERC license that expires in 2053 for two hydroelectric projects totaling 70 MW of capacity. 

State Regulation 

Utility 

Entergy Arkansas is subject to regulation by the APSC, which includes the authority to: 

&#8226; 

oversee utility service; 

&#8226; 

set retail rates; 

&#8226; 

determine reasonable and adequate service; 

&#8226; 

control leasing; 

&#8226; 

control the acquisition or sale of any public utility plant or property constituting an operating unit or system; 

&#8226; 

set rates of depreciation; 

&#8226; 

issue certificates of convenience and necessity and certificates of environmental compatibility and public need; and 

&#8226; 

regulate the issuance and sale of certain securities. 

Additionally, Entergy Arkansas serves a limited number of retail customers in Tennessee and as a result, may be required to submit certain matters approved by the APSC for consideration by the Tennessee Regulatory Authority. Additionally, Entergy Arkansas maintains limited facilities in Missouri but does not provide retail electric service to customers in Missouri. Although Entergy Arkansas obtained a certificate with respect to its Missouri facilities, Entergy Arkansas is not subject to the retail rate or regulatory scheme in Missouri. 

Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s electric and gas business is subject to regulation by the LPSC as to: 

&#8226; 

utility service; 

&#8226; 

retail rates and charges; 

&#8226; 

certification of generating facilities; 

&#8226; 

certification of power or capacity purchase contracts; 

&#8226; 

audit of the fuel adjustment charge, environmental adjustment charge, and avoided cost payment to Qualifying Facilities; 

&#8226; 

integrated resource planning; 

&#8226; 

utility mergers and acquisitions and other changes of control; and 

&#8226; 

depreciation and other matters. 

Prior to the transfer of the Algiers assets to Entergy New Orleans on September 1, 2015, Entergy Louisiana was also subject to the jurisdiction of the City Council with respect to such matters within Algiers in Orleans Parish, although the precise scope of that jurisdiction differed from that of the LPSC. 

Part I Item 1

&#8226; 

mergers and changes of control. 

Entergy Mississippi is also subject to regulation by the APSC as to the certificate of environmental compatibility and public need for the Independence Station, which is located in Arkansas. 

Entergy New Orleans is subject to regulation by the City Council as to the following: 

&#8226; 

utility service; 

&#8226; 

retail rates and charges; 

&#8226; 

standards of service; 

&#8226; 

depreciation; 

&#8226; 

issuance and sale of certain securities; and 

&#8226; 

other matters. 

To the extent authorized by governing legislation, Entergy Texas is subject to the original jurisdiction of the municipal authorities of a number of incorporated cities in Texas with appellate jurisdiction over such matters residing in the PUCT. Entergy Texas is also subject to regulation by the PUCT as to: 

&#8226; 

retail rates and service in unincorporated areas of its service territory, and in municipalities that have ceded jurisdiction to the PUCT; 

&#8226; 

customer service standards; 

&#8226; 

certification of certain transmission and generation projects; and 

&#8226; 

extensions of service into new areas. 

Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry 

Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 

Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, the operation of nuclear plants is heavily regulated by the NRC, which has broad power to impose licensing and safety-related requirements. The NRC has broad authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, as owners of all or portions of ANO, River Bend and Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, respectively, and Entergy Operations, as the licensee and operator of these units, are subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC. Entergy subsidiaries in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment are subject to the NRC&#8217;s jurisdiction as the owners and operator of Pilgrim, Indian Point Energy Center, FitzPatrick, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades. Substantial capital expenditures, increased operating expenses, and/or higher decommissioning costs at Entergy&#8217;s nuclear plants because of revised safety requirements of the NRC could be required in the future. 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 &#32; 

Spent Nuclear Fuel 

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE is required, for a specified fee, to construct storage facilities for, and to dispose of, all spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste generated by domestic nuclear power reactors. Entergy&#8217;s nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries have been charged fees for the estimated future disposal costs of spent nuclear fuel in accordance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The affected Entergy companies entered into contracts with the DOE, whereby the DOE is to furnish disposal services at a cost of one mill per net kWh generated and sold after April 7, 1983, plus a one-time fee for generation prior to that date. Entergy Arkansas is the only one of the Utility operating companies that generated electric power with nuclear fuel prior to that date and has a recorded liability as of December 31, 2015 of $181.4 million for the one-time fee. Entergy accepted assignment of the Pilgrim, FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3, Indian Point 1 and 2, Vermont Yankee, Palisades, and Big Rock Point spent fuel disposal contracts with the DOE held by their previous owners. The previous owners have paid or retained liability for the fees for all generation prior to the purchase dates of those plants. The fees payable to the DOE may be adjusted in the future to assure full recovery. Entergy considers all costs incurred for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, except accrued interest, to be proper components of nuclear fuel expense. Provisions to recover such costs have been or will be made in applications to regulatory authorities for the Utility plants. Entergy&#8217;s total spent fuel fees to date, including the one-time fee liability of Entergy Arkansas, have surpassed $1.6 billion (exclusive of amounts relating to Entergy plants that were paid or are owed by prior owners of those plants). 

The permanent spent fuel repository in the U.S. has been legislated to be Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing (the DOE filed the license application in June 2008) and, after the license is granted by the NRC, proceed with the repository construction and commencement of receipt of spent fuel. Because the DOE has not begun accepting spent fuel, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts. The DOE continues to delay meeting its obligation. Moreover, the current Presidential administration has taken specific steps to discontinue the Yucca Mountain project and study a new spent fuel strategy. Such actions included a motion to the NRC to withdraw the license application with prejudice and the establishment of a commission to develop recommendations for alternative spent fuel storage solutions. In August 2013 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ordered the NRC to continue with the Yucca Mountain license review, but only to the extent of funds previously appropriated by Congress for that purpose and not yet used. This amount of money is not expected to be sufficient to complete the review. The government has taken no effective action to date related to the recommendations of the appointed spent fuel study commission. Accordingly, large uncertainty remains regarding the time frame under which the DOE will begin to accept spent fuel from Entergy&#8217;s facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at Entergy&#8217;s nuclear sites. 

Following the current Presidential administration&#8217;s defunding of the Yucca Mountain spent fuel repository program, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and others sued the government seeking cessation of collection of the one mill per net kWh generated and sold after April 7, 1983 fee. In November 2013 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the DOE to submit a proposal to Congress to reset the fee to zero until the DOE complies with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act or Congress enacts an alternative waste disposal plan. In January 2014 the DOE submitted the proposal to Congress under protest, and also filed a petition for rehearing with the D.C. Circuit. The petition for rehearing was denied. The zero spent fuel fee went into effect prospectively in May 2014. Management cannot predict the potential timing or magnitude of future spent fuel fee revisions that may occur. 

As a result of the DOE&#8217;s failure to begin disposal of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and the spent fuel disposal contracts, Entergy&#8217;s nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries have incurred and will continue to incur damages. In November 2003 these subsidiaries, except for the owner of Palisades, began litigation to recover the damages caused by the DOE&#8217;s delay in performance. Through 2015, Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries won and collected on judgments in excess of $220 million. First round or second round damages cases are in progress covering each of the nuclear plants owned by Entergy subsidiaries. In April 2015 the U.S. Court of Federal Claims 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

issued a judgment in favor of Entergy Arkansas and against the DOE in the second round ANO damages case in the amount of $29.4 million. Also in April 2015 the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a judgment in favor of System Energy and against the DOE in the second round Grand Gulf damages case in the amount of $44.4 million. In June 2015, Entergy Arkansas and System Energy appealed portions of those decisions to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appeals remain pending. In May 2015, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued final partial summary judgment on a portion, $20.6 million, of the claims in the Palisades case. The DOE did not appeal that decision. A request for payment from the U.S. Treasury was made in September 2015, and Entergy received the payment in October 2015. In December 2015 a final judgment in Entergy&#8217;s favor was rendered by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in the Indian Point 3/FitzPatrick case in the amount of $80.9 million, but Entergy has moved for reconsideration on a portion of the disallowed costs. Although a trial has been held in the first round River Bend case, no decision has been issued. In January 2016 the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a judgment in favor of Entergy Louisiana and against the DOE in the first round Waterford 3 damages case in the amount of $49.4 million. Management cannot predict the timing or amount of any potential recoveries on other claims filed by Entergy subsidiaries, and cannot predict the timing of any eventual receipt from the DOE of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims damage awards. 

Pending DOE acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, the owners of nuclear plants are providing their own spent fuel storage. Storage capability additions using dry casks began operations at Palisades in 1993, at ANO in 1996, at FitzPatrick in 2002, at River Bend in 2005, at Grand Gulf in 2006, at Indian Point and Vermont Yankee in 2008, at Waterford 3 in 2011, and at Pilgrim in 2015. These facilities will be expanded as needed. 

Nuclear Plant Decommissioning 

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Texas, and System Energy are entitled to recover from customers through electric rates the estimated decommissioning costs for ANO, the portion of River Bend subject to retail rate regulation and Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, respectively. The collections are deposited in trust funds that can only be used for future decommissioning costs. Entergy periodically reviews and updates the estimated decommissioning costs to reflect inflation and changes in regulatory requirements and technology, and then makes applications to the regulatory authorities to reflect, in rates, the changes in projected decommissioning costs. 

In July 2010 the LPSC approved increased decommissioning collections for Waterford 3 and the Louisiana regulated share of River Bend, and in December 2010 the PUCT approved increased decommissioning collections for the Texas share of River Bend to address previously identified funding shortfalls. Entergy currently believes its decommissioning funding will be sufficient for its nuclear plants subject to retail rate regulation, although decommissioning cost inflation and trust fund performance will ultimately determine the adequacy of the funding amounts. 

Following a review in 2009, Entergy concluded that there was a funding shortfall for Vermont Yankee of approximately $40 million, which it satisfied with a $40 million guarantee from Entergy Corporation. Based on a revised financial assurance plan for Vermont Yankee, notice of cancellation of the $40 million guarantee was provided to the NRC in December 2014, and in April 2015 the NRC provided a safety analysis report stating it had no objection to the cancellation, and the guarantee has subsequently been canceled. See Note 1 to the financial statements for further discussion of Vermont Yankee decommissioning costs. 

For the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants purchased in 2000, NYPA retained the decommissioning trusts and the decommissioning liabilities. NYPA and Entergy subsidiaries executed decommissioning agreements, which specify their decommissioning obligations. NYPA has the right to require the Entergy subsidiaries to assume each of the decommissioning liabilities provided that it assigns the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to the Entergy subsidiaries. If the decommissioning liabilities are retained by NYPA, the responsible Entergy subsidiary will perform the decommissioning of the plants at a price equal to the lesser of a pre-specified level or the amount in the decommissioning trusts. 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

In March 2015, filings with the NRC were made for all Entergy subsidiaries&#8217; nuclear plants reporting on decommissioning funding. Those reports showed that decommissioning funding for each of those nuclear plants met the NRC&#8217;s financial assurance requirements. 

Additional information with respect to Entergy&#8217;s decommissioning costs and decommissioning trust funds is found in Note 9 and Note 17 to the financial statements. 

Price-Anderson Act 

The Price-Anderson Act requires that reactor licensees purchase and maintain the maximum amount of nuclear liability insurance available and participate in an industry assessment program called Secondary Financial Protection in order to protect the public in the event of a nuclear power plant accident. The costs of this insurance are borne by the nuclear power industry. Congress amended and renewed the Price-Anderson Act in 2005 for a term through 2025. The Price-Anderson Act limits the contingent liability for a single nuclear incident to a maximum assessment of approximately $127.318 million per reactor (with 103 nuclear industry reactors currently participating). In the case of a nuclear event in which Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, or an Entergy Wholesale Commodities company is liable, protection is afforded through a combination of private insurance and the Secondary Financial Protection program. In addition to this, insurance for property damage, costs of replacement power, and other risks relating to nuclear generating units is also purchased. The Price-Anderson Act and insurance applicable to the nuclear programs of Entergy are discussed in more detail in Note 8 to the financial statements. 

NRC Reactor Oversight Process 

The NRC&#8217;s Reactor Oversight Process is a program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response. The NRC evaluates plant performance by analyzing two distinct inputs: inspection findings resulting from the NRC&#8217;s inspection program and performance indicators reported by the licensee. The evaluations result in the placement of each plant in one of the NRC&#8217;s Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix columns: &#8220;licensee response column,&#8221; or Column 1, &#8220;regulatory response column,&#8221; or Column 2, &#8220;degraded cornerstone column,&#8221; or Column 3, and &#8220;multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column,&#8221; or Column 4. Plants in Column 1 are subject to normal NRC inspection activities. Plants in Column 2, Column 3, or Column 4 are subject to progressively increasing levels of inspection by the NRC with, in general, progressively increasing levels of associated costs. Waterford 3, Grand Gulf, FitzPatrick, Indian Point 2, Indian Point 3, and Palisades are in Column 1. River Bend is in Column 2. Arkansas Nuclear One Units 1 and 2 are in Column 4, and are subject to an extensive set of required NRC inspections. Pilgrim is also in Column 4 and is subject to an extensive, but limited, set of required NRC inspections. See Note 8 to the financial statements for further discussion of the placement of Arkansas Nuclear One and Pilgrim in Column 4 of the NRC&#8217;s matrix. 

Environmental Regulation 

Entergy&#8217;s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy&#8217;s businesses are in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance requirements and costs cannot be precisely estimated. Except to the extent discussed below, at this time compliance with federal, state, and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise protecting the environment, is incorporated into the routine cost structure of Entergy&#8217;s businesses and is not expected to have a material effect on their competitive position, results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

Clean Air Act and Subsequent Amendments 

The Clean Air Act and its amendments establish several programs that currently or in the future may affect Entergy&#8217;s fossil-fueled generation facilities and, to a lesser extent, certain operations at nuclear and other facilities. Individual states also operate similar independent state programs or delegated federal programs that may include requirements more stringent than federal regulatory requirements. These programs include: 

&#8226; 

New source review and preconstruction permits for new sources of criteria air pollutants, greenhouse gases, and significant modifications to existing facilities; 

&#8226; 

Acid rain program for control of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxides (NO x ); 

&#8226; 

Nonattainment area programs for control of criteria air pollutants, which could include fee assessments for air pollutant emission sources under Section 185 of the Clean Air Act if attainment is not reached in a timely manner; 

&#8226; 

Hazardous air pollutant emissions reduction programs; 

&#8226; 

Interstate Air Transport; 

&#8226; 

Operating permits program for administration and enforcement of these and other Clean Air Act programs; 

&#8226; 

Regional Haze and Best Available Retrofit Technology programs; and 

&#8226; 

New and existing source standards for greenhouse gas emissions. 

New Source Review (NSR) 

Preconstruction permits are required for new facilities and for existing facilities that undergo a modification that results in a significant net emissions increase and is not classified as routine repair, maintenance, or replacement. Units that undergo certain non-routine modifications must obtain a permit modification and may be required to install additional air pollution control technologies. Entergy has an established process for identifying modifications requiring additional permitting approval and has followed the regulations and associated guidance provided by the states and the federal government with regard to the determination of routine repair, maintenance, and replacement. In recent years, however, the EPA has begun an enforcement initiative, aimed primarily at coal plants, to identify modifications that it does not consider routine for which the unit did not obtain a modified permit. Various courts and the EPA have been inconsistent in their judgments regarding modifications that are considered routine and on other legal issues that effect this program. 

In February 2011, Entergy received a request from the EPA for several categories of information concerning capital and maintenance projects at the White Bluff and Independence facilities, both located in Arkansas, in order to determine compliance with the Clean Air Act, including New Source Review requirements and air permits issued by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality. In August 2011, Entergy&#8217;s Nelson facility, located in Louisiana, received a similar request for information from the EPA. In September 2015, a subsequent request for similar information was received for the White Bluff facility. Entergy responded or is in the process of responding to all requests. None of these EPA requests for information alleged that the facilities are in violation of law. 

Acid Rain Program 

The Clean Air Act provides SO 2 &#32;allowances to most of the affected Entergy generating units for emissions based upon past emission levels and operating characteristics. Each allowance is an entitlement to emit one ton of SO 2 &#32;per year. Plant owners are required to possess allowances for SO 2 &#32;emissions from affected generating units. Virtually all Entergy fossil-fueled generating units are subject to SO 2 &#32;allowance requirements. Entergy could be required to purchase additional allowances when it generates power using fuel oil. Fuel oil usage is determined by economic dispatch and influenced by the price and availability of natural gas, incremental emission allowance costs, and the availability and cost of purchased power. 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

Ozone Nonattainment 

Entergy Texas operates one fossil-fueled generating unit (Lewis Creek) in a geographic area that is not in attainment of the currently-enforced national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone. The nonattainment area that affects Entergy Texas is the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area. Areas in nonattainment are classified as &#8220;marginal,&#8221; &#8220;moderate,&#8221; &#8220;serious,&#8221; or &#8220;severe.&#8221; When an area fails to meet the ambient air standard, the EPA requires state regulatory authorities to prepare state implementation plans meant to cause progress toward bringing the area into attainment with applicable standards. 

The Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area was originally classified as &#8220;moderate&#8221; nonattainment under the 1997 8-hour ozone standard with an attainment date of June 15, 2010. In June 2007 the Texas governor petitioned the EPA to reclassify Houston-Galveston-Brazoria from &#8220;moderate&#8221; to &#8220;severe&#8221; and the EPA granted the request in October 2008. The area&#8217;s new attainment date for the 8-hour ozone standard is as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than June 15, 2019. In February 2015 the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) submitted a request to EPA for a finding, and in December 2015, the EPA issued the finding that the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area is in attainment with the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. 

In March 2008, the EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone, creating the potential for additional counties and parishes in which Entergy operates to be placed in nonattainment status. In April 2012 the EPA released its final non-attainment designations for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. In Entergy&#8217;s utility service area, the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria, Texas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Memphis, Tennessee/Mississippi/Arkansas areas were designated as in &#8220;marginal&#8221; nonattainment. In August 2015 and January 2016, the EPA proposed determinations that the Baton Rouge and Memphis areas had attained the 2008 standard. These final determinations are pending. 

In October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the primary and secondary NAAQS for ozone to a level of 70 parts per billion. States will have approximately one year to assess their attainment status and recommend designations to the EPA. The EPA will then have approximately a year to review those recommendations and make final designations. States are expected to file compliance plans by the end of 2018. The assessments likely will be based on data from 2014-2016. Entergy will continue to work with state environmental agencies on appropriate methods for assessing attainment and non-attainment with the new standard and, where necessary, in planning for compliance. Following designation approval by the EPA, states will be required to develop plans intended to return non-attainment areas to a condition of attainment. The timing for that action depends largely on the severity of non-attainment in a given area. 

Potential SO 2 &#160; Nonattainment 

The EPA issued a final rule in June 2010 adopting an SO 2 &#32;1-hour national ambient air quality standard of 75 parts per billion. The EPA designations for counties in attainment and nonattainment were originally due in June 2012, but the EPA initially indicated that it would delay designations except for those areas with existing monitoring data from 2009 to 2011 indicating violations of the new standard. In August 2013 the EPA issued final designations for these areas. In Entergy&#8217;s utility service territory, only St. Bernard Parish in Louisiana is designated as non-attainment for the SO 2 &#32;1-hour national ambient air quality standard of 75 parts per billion. Entergy does not have a generation asset in that parish. Pursuant to a court order issued in a proceeding in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the EPA will finalize another round of designations by July 2, 2016, for areas with newly monitored violations of the 2010 standard and those with stationary sources that emit over a threshold amount of SO 2 . Counties and parishes in which Entergy owns and operates fossil generating facilities that are expected to be assessed in this round of designations include Independence County and Jefferson County, Arkansas and Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. In other areas, analysis is required once the EPA issues additional final regulations and guidance. In September 2015 the State of Arkansas recommended designations of &#8220;Unclassifiable/Attainment&#8221; for Independence and Jefferson Counties. In September 2015 the State of Louisiana recommended a designation of &#8220;Attainment&#8221; for Calcasieu Parish. In August 2015 the EPA issued a final data requirement rule for the SO 2 &#32;1-hour standard. This rule will guide the process to be followed by the states and the EPA to determine the appropriate designation for the remaining unclassified 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

areas in the country. Additional capital projects or operational changes may be required to continue operating Entergy facilities in areas eventually designated as in non-attainment of the standard or designated as contributing to non-attainment areas. 

Hazardous Air Pollutants 

The EPA released the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) rule in December 2011, which has a compliance date, with a widely granted one-year extension, of April 2016. In June 2015 the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit decision and remanded to the D.C. Circuit the EPA&#8217;s finding that it was appropriate and necessary to regulate power plants under Clean Air Act section 112, ruling that the EPA must consider costs. This EPA finding underpins the MATS rule. In November 2015 the EPA released a Proposed Supplemental Finding that consideration of costs does not alter its previous conclusion that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutants from power plants. In December 2015 the D.C. Circuit issued a ruling to leave the rule in effect while EPA finalizes the appropriate and necessary finding to consider costs. Compliance with MATS was required by the Clean Air Act within three years, or by 2015, although certain extensions of this deadline were available from state permit authorities and the EPA. Entergy applied for and received a one-year extension for its affected facilities in Arkansas and Louisiana. The required controls have been installed and are being tested prior to full scale operation and to confirm regulatory compliance. Additional expenditures or operational modifications could be required for compliance depending on the final outcome of testing. 

Cross-State Air Pollution 

In March 2005 the EPA finalized the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which was intended to reduce SO 2 &#32;and NO x &#32;emissions from electric generation plants in order to improve air quality in twenty-nine eastern states. The rule required a combination of capital investment to install pollution control equipment and increased operating costs through the purchase of emission allowances. Entergy began implementation in 2007, including installation of controls at several facilities and the development of an emission allowance procurement strategy. 

Based on several court challenges, CAIR was vacated and remanded to the EPA by the D.C. Circuit in 2008. The court allowed CAIR to become effective in January 2009, while the EPA revised the rule. In July 2011 the EPA released its final Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR, which previously was referred to as the Transport Rule). The rule was directed at limiting the interstate transport of emissions of NO x &#32;and SO 2 &#32;as precursors to ozone and fine particulate matter. The final rule provided a significantly lower number of allowances to Entergy&#8217;s Utility states than did the draft rule. Entergy and others challenged these allocations. Litigation concerning several issues not determined by the Supreme Court continued in the D.C. Circuit until July 2015, when that court invalidated the allowance budgets created by the EPA for several states, including Texas, and remanded that portion of the rule to the EPA for further action. The court did not stay or vacate the rule in the interim. CSAPR remains in effect. 

The CSAPR Phase 1 implementation became effective January 1, 2015. Entergy has developed a compliance plan that could, over time, include both installation of controls at certain facilities and an emission allowance procurement strategy. 

In November 2015 the EPA released a proposed CSAPR update rule to address interstate transport for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Starting in 2017, this proposal would reduce summertime nitrogen oxides (NO X ) emissions from power plants in 23 states, with significant reductions in some states such as Arkansas and Mississippi. Entergy will continue to interact with state and federal agencies as the final rule is developed. 

Regional Haze 

&#32;In June 2005 the EPA issued its final Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) regulations that potentially could result in a requirement to install SO 2 &#32;and NO x &#32;pollution control technology as Best Available Retrofit Control Technology (BART) to continue operating certain of Entergy&#8217;s fossil generation units. The rule leaves certain CAVR determinations 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

to the states. The Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) prepared a State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Arkansas facilities to implement its obligations under the CAVR. In April 2012 the EPA finalized a decision addressing the Arkansas Regional Haze SIP, in which it disapproved a large portion of the Arkansas Regional Haze SIP, including the emission limits for NO x &#32;and SO 2 &#32;at White Bluff. This triggered a two-year timeframe for EPA to either approve a revised SIP issued by Arkansas or issue a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP). This two-year time frame expired in April 2014. By Court order, the EPA is to issue a final FIP for Arkansas Regional Haze by no later than August 31, 2016. In April 2015 the EPA published a proposed FIP for Arkansas, taking comment on requiring installation of scrubbers and low NO x &#32;burners to continue operating both units at the White Bluff plant and both units at the Independence plant and NO x &#32;controls to continue operating the Lake Catherine plant. Entergy filed comment by the deadline in August 2015. Among other comments, including opposition to the EPA&#8217;s proposed controls on the Independence units, Entergy proposed to meet more stringent SO 2 and NO x limits at both White Bluff and Independence within three years of the effective date of the final FIP and to cease the use of coal at the White Bluff units in 2027 and 2028. 

Entergy is working with the LDEQ and the EPA to revise the Louisiana SIP for regional haze, which was disapproved in part in 2012. In September 2015 the Sierra Club filed suit against the EPA in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. for failure either to approve a revised SIP issued by Louisiana or issue a FIP within two years of the partial Louisiana SIP disapproval. The suit requests that the U.S. District Court order the EPA Administrator to issue a regional haze and interstate transport FIP for Louisiana by a certain date. This would set the timing for a final approval of a revised SIP issued by Louisiana or a FIP issued by the EPA. At this time, it is premature to predict what controls, if any, might be required for compliance. 

Fine Particle (PM2.5) National Ambient Air Quality Standard 

In December 2012 the EPA released regulations that lowered the NAAQS for fine particle pollution or PM2.5. In January 2015 the EPA finalized area designations for this standard. All areas in Entergy&#8217;s service territory were designated as &#8220;Unclassifiable/Attainment&#8221; for this standard. Entergy will continue to monitor and engage, as necessary, in the state&#8217;s implementation process in Entergy states. 

NNew and Existing Source Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions 

&#160; 

As a part of a climate plan announced in June 2013, President Obama directed the EPA to (i) reissue proposed carbon pollution standards for new power plants by September 20, 2013, with finalization of the rules to occur in a timely manner; (ii) issue proposed carbon pollution standards, regulations, or guidelines, as appropriate, for modified, reconstructed, and existing power plants no later than June 1, 2014; (iii) finalize those rules by no later than June 1, 2015; and (iv) include in the guidelines addressing existing power plants a requirement that states submit to the EPA the implementation plans required under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act and its implementing regulations by no later than June 30, 2016. In January 2014, the EPA issued the proposed New Source Performance Standards rule for new sources. In June 2014 the EPA issued proposed standards for existing power plants. Entergy has been actively engaged in the rulemaking process, having submitted comments to the EPA in December 2014. The EPA issued the final rule for both new and existing sources in August 2015, and it was published in the Federal Register in October 2015. The rule, also called the Clean Power Plan, requires states to develop compliance plans with the EPA&#8217;s emission standards. In February 2016 the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay halting the effectiveness of the rule until the rule is reviewed by the D.C. Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. Entergy continues to review the rule and work with various stakeholders during the planning process; litigation has commenced regarding the rule and is expected to continue. Costs of implementation cannot be determined at this time and will depend largely on the forthcoming state section 111(d) implementation plans.

Potential Legislative, Regulatory, and Judicial Developments 

In addition to the specific instances described above, there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning air emissions, as well as other media, that are under consideration at the federal, state, and local level. Because of the nature of Entergy&#8217;s business, the imposition of any of these initiatives could affect Entergy&#8217;s operations. Entergy continues to monitor these initiatives and activities in order to analyze their potential operational and cost implications. These initiatives include: 

&#8226; 

designation by the EPA and state environmental agencies of areas that are not in attainment with national ambient air quality standards; 

&#8226; 

introduction of bills in Congress and development of regulations by the EPA proposing further limits on NO x , SO 2 , mercury, and carbon dioxide and other air emissions. New legislation or regulations applicable to stationary sources could take the form of market-based cap-and-trade programs, direct requirements for the installation of air emission controls onto air emission sources, or other or combined regulatory programs; 

&#8226; 

efforts in Congress or at the EPA to establish a mandatory federal carbon dioxide emission control structure or unit performance standards; 

&#8226; 

revisions to the estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon used for regulatory impact analysis of Federal laws and regulations; 

&#8226; 

implementation of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative by several states in the northeastern United States and similar actions in other regions of the United States; 

&#8226; 

efforts on the state and federal level to codify renewable portfolio standards, a clean energy standard, or a similar mechanism requiring utilities to produce or purchase a certain percentage of their power from defined renewable energy sources or energy sources with lower emissions; 

&#8226; 

efforts to develop more stringent state water quality standards, effluent limitations for Entergy&#8217;s industry sector, stormwater runoff control regulations, and cooling water intake structure requirements; 

&#8226; 

efforts to restrict the previously-approved continued use of oil-filled equipment containing certain levels of PCBs; and 

&#8226; 

efforts by certain external groups to encourage reporting and disclosure of carbon dioxide emissions and risk. 

Entergy continues to support national legislation that would increase planning certainty for electric utilities while addressing carbon dioxide emissions in a responsible and flexible manner. By virtue of its proportionally large investment in low-emitting gas-fired and nuclear generation technologies, Entergy has a low overall carbon dioxide emission &#8220;intensity,&#8221; or rate of carbon dioxide emitted per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated. In anticipation of the imposition of carbon dioxide emission limits on the electric industry in the future, Entergy initiated actions designed to reduce its exposure to potential new governmental requirements related to carbon dioxide emissions. These voluntary actions included establishment of a formal program to stabilize power plant carbon dioxide emissions at 2000 levels through 2005, and Entergy succeeded in reducing emissions below 2000 levels. Total carbon dioxide emissions representing Entergy&#8217;s ownership share of power plants in the United States were approximately 53.2 million tons in 2000 and 35.6 million tons in 2005. In 2006, Entergy changed its method of calculating emissions to include emissions from controllable power purchases as well as its ownership share of generation. Entergy established a second formal voluntary program to stabilize power plant carbon dioxide emissions and emissions from controllable power purchases at 20% below 2000 levels through 2010. In 2011, Entergy extended this commitment through 2020. Total carbon dioxide emissions representing Entergy&#8217;s ownership share of power plants and controllable power purchases in the United States were approximately 46.1 million tons in 2011, approximately 45.5 million tons in 2012, approximately 46.2 million tons in 2013, approximately 42.4 million tons in 2014, and approximately 39.5 million tons in 2015. The decrease in this number since 2014 is largely attributable to the impact on the calculation methodology of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transition into the MISO system. Participation in this system resulted in fewer power purchases being classified as &#8220;controllable&#8221; and thus included in the calculation of the emissions total. 

&#160; 

Entergy has prepared responses for the Carbon Disclosure Project&#8217;s (CDP) annual questionnaire for the past several years and has given permission for those responses to be posted on the CDP&#8217;s website. This information, based 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

in part on an annual third-party greenhouse gas emissions inventory verification, commissioned by Entergy, provides information on a broader scope of emissions from overall operations. 

Nelson Unit 6 (Entergy Louisiana) 

Entergy Louisiana has self-reported to the LDEQ an annual carbon monoxide (CO) emission limit deviation at the Nelson Unit 6 coal-fired facility for the years 2006-2010 and the failure to report these deviations in semi-annual reporting and in annual Title V compliance certifications. Entergy Louisiana is not required to monitor carbon monoxide emissions from Nelson Unit 6 using a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS). Stack tests performed in 2010 appear to indicate CO emissions in excess of the maximum hourly limit for three - 1 hour test runs; however, comparison of the 2010 stack tests with the most recent previous tests, from 2006, appear to indicate that the permit limits were calculated incorrectly in the Title V Permit application and should have been higher using the 2006 stack test as the basis. The 2010 test emission levels did not cause a violation of NAAQS. Additionally, the 2010 stack testing, which was performed in compliance with an EPA data request connected to the agency&#8217;s development of a new air emissions rule, was not taken during a period of normal and representative operations for Nelson 6. Settlement negotiations continue with the LDEQ. 

Clean Water Act 

The 1972 amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (known as the Clean Water Act) provide the statutory basis for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program and the basic structure for regulating the discharge of pollutants from point sources to waters of the United States. The Clean Water Act requires virtually all discharges of pollutants to waters of the United States to be permitted. Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act regulates cooling water intake structures, section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires a water quality certification from the state in support of certain federal actions and approvals, and section 404 regulates the dredge and fill of waters of the United States, including jurisdictional wetlands. 

NPDES Permits and Section 401 Water Quality Certifications 

NPDES permits are subject to renewal every five years. Consequently, Entergy is currently in various stages of the data evaluation and discharge permitting process for its power plants. Additionally, the State of New York has taken the position that a new state-issued water quality certification is required as part of the NRC license renewal process. Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; Indian Point nuclear facility in New York is seeking a new Section 401 certification prior to license renewal under full reservation of rights. 

Indian Point 

Entergy is involved in an administrative permitting process with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) for renewal of the Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 discharge permit. In November 2003 the NYSDEC issued a draft permit indicating that closed cycle cooling would be considered the &#8220;best technology available&#8221; for minimizing alleged adverse environmental effects attributable to the intake of cooling water at Indian Point, subject to a feasibility determination and alternatives analysis for that technology, if Entergy applied for and received NRC license renewal for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3. Upon becoming effective, the draft permit also would have required payment of approximately $24 million annually, and an annual 42 unit-day outage period, until closed cycle cooling is implemented. Entergy is participating in the administrative process to request that the draft permit be modified prior to final issuance, and opposes any requirement to install cooling towers at Indian Point. 

An August 2008 ruling by the NYSDEC&#8217;s Assistant Commissioner restructured the permitting and administrative process, including the application of a new economic test designed to implement the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals standard in that court&#8217;s review of the EPA&#8217;s cooling water intake structure rules, which is discussed in the 316(b) Cooling Water Intake Structures section below. The NYSDEC directed Entergy to develop detailed feasibility information regarding the construction and operation of cooling towers, and alternatives to closed cycle 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

cooling, prior to the issuance of a new draft permit by the NYSDEC staff and commencement of the adjudicatory proceeding. The reports include a visual impact and aesthetics report filed in June 2009, a plume and emissions report filed in September 2009, a technical feasibility report and alternatives analysis filed in February 2010, and an economic report to establish whether the technology, if feasible, satisfies the economic test that is part of the New York standard. Entergy requested that the NYSDEC Assistant Commissioner reconsider the New York standard in light of the U.S. Supreme Court decision reversing the Second Circuit&#8217;s alternative economic test adopted in the August 2008 ruling. In November 2012 the NYSDEC Assistant Commissioner&#8217;s delegate issued a decision overturning the alternative economic test adopted in the August 2008 ruling and reestablishing the &#8220;wholly disproportionate&#8221; test derived from previous New York precedent. The wholly disproportionate test considers whether the costs of a technology are wholly disproportionate to the environmental benefits gained from the technology. 

In February 2010, Entergy provided to the NYSDEC an updated estimate of the capital cost to retrofit Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 with cooling towers. Construction costs for retrofitting with cooling towers are estimated to be at least $1.19 billion, in addition to lost generation of approximately 14.5 terawatt-hours (TWh) during the forced outage of both units that is estimated to take at least 42 weeks. Entergy also proposed an alternative to the cooling towers, the use of cylindrical wedgewire screens, the construction costs of which are now expected to be approximately $250 million to $300 million. Because a cooling tower retrofitting of this size and complexity has never been undertaken at an operating nuclear facility, significant uncertainties exist in the capital cost estimates and, therefore, the actual capital costs could be materially higher than estimated. Moreover, construction outage-related costs to Entergy have not been calculated because of the significant variability in power pricing at any given time, but they are expected to be significant and may exceed the capital costs. The capital cost estimate for the construction of Entergy&#8217;s alternative technology proposal, wedgewire screens, is also subject to uncertainty. Hearings on certain issues began in 2011 in consolidation with certain issues in the water quality certification matter. 

Additional hearings were held in July 2013 before the NYSDEC ALJs on environmental issues related to Indian Point&#8217;s wedgewire screen proposal as &#8220;best technology available.&#8221; In 2014, hearings were held on NYSDEC&#8217;s proposed best technology available, closed cycle cooling. NYSDEC also has proposed annual fish protection outages of 42, 62, or 92 days at both units or at one unit with closed cycle cooling at the other. The ALJs held a further legislative hearing and issues conference on this NYSDEC staff proposal in July 2014. NYSDEC staff subsequently withdrew the 92-day option. Hearings on the remaining outage proposals, including a 118-day option proposed by Riverkeeper, were held in September 2015, and post-hearing briefing on both the closed cycle cooling proposal and the outages proposal has been scheduled for May and July 2016. The estimated costs for the outage proposals range from $1.8 billion to $2.4 billion, and include direct costs, lost revenues, and operation and maintenance expenses. For additional discussion of this and other proceedings related to Indian Point, see &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Authorizations to Operate Its Nuclear Plants &#8221; in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis. 

316(b) Cooling Water Intake Structures 

The EPA finalized regulations in July 2004 governing the intake of water at large existing power plants employing cooling water intake structures. The rule sought to reduce perceived impacts on aquatic resources by requiring covered facilities to implement technology or other measures to meet EPA-targeted reductions in water use and corresponding perceived aquatic impacts. Entergy, other industry members and industry groups, environmental groups, and a coalition of northeastern and mid-Atlantic states challenged various aspects of the rule. After litigation, in May 2014, the EPA issued a new final 316(b) rule, followed by publication in the Federal Register in August 2014, with the final rule effective in October 2014. Entergy is developing a compliance plan for each affected facility in accordance with the requirements of the final rule. 

Entergy filed as a co-petitioner with the Utility Water Act Group a petition for review of the final rule. The case will be heard in the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Entergy expects briefing on the case to occur in 2016.

Coastal Zone Management Act 

Before a federal licensing agency (such as the NRC) may issue a major license or permit for an activity within the federally designated coastal zone, the agency must be satisfied that the requirements of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), as applicable, have been met. In many cases, CZMA requirements are satisfied by the state&#8217;s written concurrence with a &#8220;consistency determination&#8221; filed by the federal license applicant explaining why the activity proposed to be federally licensed is consistent with the state&#8217;s coastal management program. The CZMA gives the state six months to act once the consistency determination is deemed complete; failure to act is treated as a deemed concurrence. Entergy is pursuing three independent paths to ensure that CZMA requirements for Indian Point license renewal are met. For additional discussion of the CZMA proceedings related to Indian Point license renewal see &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Authorizations to Operate Its Nuclear Plants &#8221; in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis. 

Effluent Limitation Guidelines 

In September 2015 the EPA issued the final rule updating the effluent limitation guidelines (ELG) for steam electric power plants. The final rule establishes Best Available Technology Economically Achievable, New Source Performance Standards, Pretreatment Standards for Existing Sources, and Pretreatment Standards for New Sources that may apply to discharges of six waste streams; flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater, fly ash transport water, bottom ash transport water, flue gas mercury control wastewater, gasification wastewater, and combustion residual leachate. Entergy is currently assessing the impact of the final rule. While the rule overall is quite stringent, initial assessments indicate its impact to Entergy&#8217;s facilities will not be material; however it is expected to impact the design and operation of any newly constructed facilities. 

Federal Jurisdiction of Waters of the United States 

In September 2013 the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced the intention to propose a rule to clarify federal Clean Water Act jurisdiction over waters of the United States. The announcement was made in conjunction with the EPA&#8217;s release of a draft scientific report on the &#8220;connectivity&#8221; of waters that the agency says will inform the rulemaking - this report was finalized in January 2015. The Final Rule was published in the Federal Register in June 2015. The rule could significantly increase the number and types of waters included in the EPA&#8217;s and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers&#8217; jurisdiction, which in turn could pose additional permitting and pollutant management burdens on Entergy&#8217;s operations. Entergy is actively engaged with the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to identify issues that require clarification in expected technical and policy guidance documents. The final rule has been challenged in federal court by several parties, including over twenty-five states. In August 2015 the District Court for North Dakota issued a preliminary injunction staying the new rule in 13 states. In October 2015 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a nationwide stay of the rule. Entergy will continue to monitor this rulemaking and ensure compliance with existing permitting processes. In response to the stay, EPA and the U.S. Army Corps resumed nationwide use of the agencies&#8217; regulations as they existed prior to August 27, 2015. 

Groundwater at Certain Nuclear Sites 

The NRC requires nuclear power plants to monitor and report regularly the presence of radioactive material in the environment. Entergy joined other nuclear utilities and the Nuclear Energy Institute in 2006 to develop a voluntary groundwater monitoring and protection program. This initiative began after detection of very low levels of radioactive material, primarily tritium, in groundwater at several plants in the United States. Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen that occurs naturally and is also a byproduct of nuclear plant operations. In addition to tritium, other radionuclides have been found in site groundwater at nuclear plants. 

As part of the groundwater monitoring and protection program, Entergy has: (1) performed reviews of plant groundwater characteristics (hydrology) and historical records of past events on site that may have potentially impacted groundwater; (2) implemented fleet procedures on how to handle events that could impact groundwater; and (3) installed 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

groundwater monitoring wells and began periodic sampling. The program also includes protocols for notifying local officials if contamination is found. To date, radionuclides such as tritium have been detected at Arkansas Nuclear One, FitzPatrick, Indian Point, Palisades, Pilgrim, Grand Gulf, Vermont Yankee, and River Bend. Each of these sites has installed groundwater monitoring wells and implemented a program for testing groundwater at the sites for the presence of tritium and other radionuclides. Based on current information, the concentrations and locations of radionuclides detected at these plants pose no threat to public health or safety, but each site continues to evaluate the results from its groundwater monitoring program. 

In early February 2016, Entergy disclosed that elevated tritium levels had been detected in samples from several monitoring wells that are part of Indian Point&#8217;s groundwater monitoring program. Investigation of the cause is under way, and groundwater monitoring continues. 

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), authorizes the EPA to mandate clean-up by, or to collect reimbursement of clean-up costs from, owners or operators of sites at which hazardous substances may be or have been released. Certain private parties also may use CERCLA to recover response costs. Parties that transported hazardous substances to these sites or arranged for the disposal of the substances are also deemed liable by CERCLA. CERCLA has been interpreted to impose strict, joint and several liability on responsible parties. Many states have adopted programs similar to CERCLA. Entergy subsidiaries in the Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities businesses have sent waste materials to various disposal sites over the years, and releases have occurred at Entergy facilities. In addition, environmental laws now regulate certain of Entergy&#8217;s operating procedures and maintenance practices that historically were not subject to regulation. Some disposal sites used by Entergy subsidiaries have been the subject of governmental action under CERCLA or similar state programs, resulting in site clean-up activities. Entergy subsidiaries have participated to various degrees in accordance with their respective potential liabilities in such site clean-ups and have developed experience with clean-up costs. The affected Entergy subsidiaries have established provisions for the liabilities for such environmental clean-up and restoration activities. Details of CERCLA and similar state program liabilities that are not de minimis &#32;are discussed in the &#8220;Other Environmental Matters&#8221; section below. 

Coal Combustion Residuals 

In June 2010 the EPA issued a proposed rule on coal combustion residuals (CCRs) that contained two primary regulatory options: (1) regulating CCRs destined for disposal in landfills or received (including stored) in surface impoundments as so-called &#8220;special wastes&#8221; under the hazardous waste program of RCRA Subtitle C; or (2) regulating CCRs destined for disposal in landfills or surface impoundments as non-hazardous wastes under Subtitle D of RCRA. Under both options, CCRs that are beneficially reused in certain processes would remain excluded from hazardous waste regulation. In April 2015 the EPA published the final CCR rule with the material being regulated under the second scenario presented above - as non-hazardous wastes regulated under RCRA Subtitle D. 

The final regulations create new compliance requirements including modified storage, new notification and reporting practices, product disposal considerations, and CCR unit closure criteria. Entergy believes that on-site disposal options will be available at its facilities, to the extent needed for CCR that cannot be transferred for beneficial reuse. As of December 31, 2015, Entergy&#8217;s balance sheet included asset retirement obligations related to CCR management of $7.9 million, including $3.6 million at Entergy Arkansas, $1.7 million at Entergy Louisiana, $1.1 million at Entergy Mississippi, and $1.2 million at Entergy Texas.

Other Environmental Matters 

Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas 

Several class action and other suits have been filed in state and federal courts seeking relief from Entergy Gulf States, Inc. and others for damages caused by the disposal of hazardous waste and for asbestos-related disease allegedly resulting from exposure on Entergy Gulf States, Inc.&#8217;s premises (see &#8220;Litigation&#8221; below). 

Entergy Louisiana, as successor in interest to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, currently is involved in the second phase of the remedial investigation of the Lake Charles Service Center site, located in Lake Charles, Louisiana. A manufactured gas plant (MGP) is believed to have operated at this site from approximately 1916 to 1931. Coal tar, a by-product of the distillation process employed at MGPs, apparently was routed to a portion of the property for disposal. The same area also has been used as a landfill. In 1999, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. signed a second administrative consent order with the EPA to perform a removal action at the site. In 2002 approximately 7,400 tons of contaminated soil and debris were excavated and disposed of from an area within the service center. In 2003 a cap was constructed over the remedial area to prevent the migration of contamination to the surface. In August 2005 an administrative order was issued by the EPA requiring that a 10-year groundwater study be conducted at this site. The groundwater monitoring study commenced in January 2006 and is continuing. The EPA released the second Five Year Review in 2015. The EPA believes that the current remediation technique is insufficient, and Entergy will need to utilize other remediation technologies on the site. In July 2015, Entergy submitted a Focused Feasibility Study to the EPA outlining the potential remedies and the suggested installation of a waterloo barrier. The estimated cost for this remedy is approximately $2 million. Entergy expects direction from the EPA on the remedy selection in early 2016. Entergy is continuing discussions with the EPA regarding the ongoing actions at the site. 

Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans 

Several class action and other suits have been filed in state and federal courts seeking relief from Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans and others for damages caused by the disposal of hazardous waste and for asbestos-related disease allegedly resulting from exposure on Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s and Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s premises (see &#8220; Litigation &#8221; below). 

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas 

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) notified Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas that the TCEQ believes those entities are potentially responsible parties (PRPs) concerning contamination existing at the San Angelo Electric Service Company (SESCO) facility in San Angelo, Texas. The facility operated as a transformer repair and scrapping facility from the 1930s until 2003. Both soil and groundwater contamination exists at the site. Entergy subsidiaries sent transformers to this facility. Entergy Texas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Arkansas responded to an information request from the TCEQ and continue to cooperate in this investigation. Entergy Texas and Entergy Louisiana joined a group of PRPs responding to site conditions in cooperation with the State of Texas, creating cost allocation models based on review of SESCO documents and employee interviews, and investigating contribution actions against other PRPs. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas have agreed to contribute to the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at the site in a measure proportionate to those companies&#8217; involvement at the site, while Entergy Arkansas likely will pay a de minimis amount. Current estimates, although variable depending on ultimate remediation design and performance, indicate that Entergy&#8217;s total share of remediation costs likely will be approximately $1.5 million to $2 million. Remediation activities continue at the site. 

Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas 

The EPA notified Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Texas, and Entergy New Orleans that the EPA believes those entities are PRPs concerning contamination of an area known as &#8220;Devil&#8217;s Swamp Lake&#8221; near the Port of Baton Rouge, 

Part I Item 1 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

Louisiana. The area allegedly was contaminated by the operations of Rollins Environmental (LA), Inc, which operated a disposal facility to which many companies contributed waste. Documents provided by the EPA indicate that Entergy Louisiana may also be a PRP. Entergy continues to monitor this developing situation. 

Entergy Arkansas 

In April 2014 an EF4 tornado impacted two substation transformers in Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s Mayflower EHV substation. The tornado caused a release of approximately 25,000 gallons of non-PCB transformer oils, which subsequently flowed into a creek on Entergy Arkansas property. A report was made to the National Response Center, and several environmental agencies responded. Entergy initiated spill response activities within hours of the release with eventual oversight of the EPA and Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) personnel. At the direction of the agencies, Entergy Arkansas has installed several temporary monitoring and recovery wells throughout the site and has regularly pumped and sampled the wells to determine the site meets regulatory screening limits. Acceptable screening limits have been achieved and Entergy Arkansas has received notification from the ADEQ that the site remediation is sufficient. Entergy Arkansas is awaiting a No Further Action letter; however it is believed that the remaining liability at the site is minimal and should not exceed the existing provision of $.29 million. Remaining costs should be limited to administrative oversight charges from EPA and ADEQ. 

Entergy 

In May 2015 a transformer at the Indian Point facility failed, resulting in a fire and the release of non-PCB oil to the ground surface. The fire was extinguished by the facility&#8217;s fire deluge system. No injuries occurred due to the transformer failure or company response. An estimated 3,000 gallons of oil were released into the facility&#8217;s discharge canal and the environment surrounding the transformer and discharge canal, including the Hudson River, as a result of the failure, fire, and fire suppression. Once the fire was extinguished, Indian Point personnel and contractors began recovering free-product from the damaged transformer, the transformer containment moat, and the area surrounding the transformer. The United States Coast Guard designated Entergy as the responsible party under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and assessed a $1,000 civil penalty for the discharge of oil into navigable waters. As required, Entergy established a claims process including a voluntary hotline. Entergy received no reports to the voluntary hotline or claims under the established claims process. Additional on-site remedial work including subsurface investigation continues, and the State of New York and/or the EPA may assess a penalty due to the release of oil to waters of the state. Discussions with the state continue, and Entergy has recorded a provision for the potential outcome of this matter. 

Litigation 

Entergy uses legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against it, but certain states in which Entergy operates have proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases. The litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk to Entergy.
