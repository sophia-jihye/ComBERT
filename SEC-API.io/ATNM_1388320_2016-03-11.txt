 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

Business Overview 

&#160;

Our most advanced products are Actimab&#8482;-A, an antibody-drug construct containing actinium 225 (Ac-225), currently in human clinical trials for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and Iomab&#8482;-B, an antibody-drug construct containing iodine 131 (I-131), used in myeloconditioning for hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (HSCT) in various indications. We are currently preparing for a Phase 3 trial of Iomab&#8482;-B for bone marrow conditioning for HSCT in relapsed and refractory AML patients age of 55 and older, which upon successful completion of our clinical trials we intend to submit for marketing approval. We are currently also considering filing an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for breakthrough therapy designation for Actimab&#8482;-A and/or Iomab&#8482;-B. We are developing our cancer drugs using our expertise in radioimmunotherapy. In addition, our Ac-225 based drug development relies on the patented Alpha Particle Immunotherapy Technology (APIT) platform technology co-developed with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), whose indirect subsidiary, Actinium Holdings Ltd., is a significant stockholder in our company. The APIT technology couples monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with extremely potent but comparatively safe alpha particle emitting radioactive isotopes, in particular actinium 225 and bismuth 213. The final drug construct is designed to specifically target and kill cancer cells while minimizing side effects. We intend to develop a number of products for different types of cancer and derive revenue from partnering relationships with large pharmaceutical companies and/or direct sales of its products in specialty markets in the United States. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

We intend to potentially develop our most advanced clinical stage product candidates through approval in the case of Iomab&#8482;-B, and up to and including a Phase 2 proof of concept human clinical trial (a trial designed to provide data on the drug&#8217;s efficacy) in the case of Actimab&#8482;-A. If these efforts are successful, we may elect to commercialize Iomab&#8482;-B on our own or with a partner in the United States and/or outside of the United States to out-license the rights to develop and commercialize the product to a strategic partner. In the case of Actimab&#8482;-A, we will most likely seek to enter into strategic partnerships whereby the strategic partner(s) co-fund(s) further human clinical trials of the drug that are needed to obtain regulatory approvals for commercial sale within and outside of the United States. In parallel, we intend to identify and begin initial human trials with additional actinium-225 product candidates in other cancer indications. We intend to retain marketing rights for our products in the United States whenever possible and out-license marketing rights to our partners for the rest of the world. We may also seek to in license other applicable opportunities should such technology become available.

Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

We are competing in the marketplace for cancer treatments estimated to reach over $83-88 billion in 2016 sales, according to &#8220;The Global Use of Medicines: Outlook Through 2016 Report by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, July 2012&#8221;. While surgery, radiation and chemotherapy remain staple treatments for cancer, their use is limited by the fact that they often cause substantial damage to normal cells. On the other hand, targeted monoclonal antibody therapies exert most or all of their effect directly on cancer cells, but often lack sufficient killing power to eradicate all cancer cells with just the antibody. A new approach for treating cancer is to combine the precision of antibody-based targeting agents with the killing power of radiation or chemotherapy by attaching powerful killing agents to precise molecular carriers called monoclonal antibodies (mAb). We use mAbs labeled with radioisotopes to deliver potent doses of radiation directly to cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. The radioisotopes we use are the alpha emitter Ac-225 and the beta emitter I-131. I-131 is among the best known and well characterized radioisotopes. It is used very successfully in treatment of papillary and follicular thyroid cancer as well as other thyroid conditions. It is also attached to a monoclonal antibody in treatment of Non-Hodgkin&#8217;s Lymphoma (NHL). It is also used experimentally with different carriers in other cancers. Ac-225 has many unique properties and we believe we are a leader in developing this alpha emitter for clinical applications using our proprietary Alpha particle Immunotherapy (APIT) technology.

&#160; 

Our most advanced products are Actimab&#8482;-A, Ac-225 labeled mAb for treatment of newly diagnosed AML, a cancer of the blood, in patients ineligible for currently approved therapies; and Iomab&#8482;-B, I-131 labeled mAb for preparation of relapsed and refractory AML patients for HSCT. Iomab&#8482;-B offers a potentially curative treatment for these patients, most of whom do not survive beyond a year after being diagnosed with this condition. Iomab&#8482;-B has also demonstrated efficacy in HSCT preparation for other blood cancer indications, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Hodgkin&#8217;s Lymphoma, and Non-Hodgkin&#8217;s Lymphoma (NHL). These are all follow-on indications for which Iomab&#8482;-B can be developed and it is our intention to explore these opportunities if and when financing becomes available. We believe the aggregate worldwide market potential for the treatment of AML, MDS, ALL, Hodgkin&#8217;s Lymphoma, multiple myeloma and NHL is approximately $4.1 billion. &#160; 

&#160; 

On December 16, 2015, Company announced that the FDA cleared the Company's IND filing for Iomab-B, and that it will proceed with the pivotal, Phase 3 clinical trial. Actinium anticipates the Phase 3, controlled, randomized, pivotal trial will begin enrolling patients in the first half of 2016 and assuming that the trial meets its end points, it will form the basis for a Biologics Licensing Application (BLA). The Company, in its recently approved IND filing, established an agreement with the FDA that the path to a Biologics License Application submission would include a single, pivotal Phase 3 clinical study if it is successful. The population in this two arm, randomized, controlled, multicenter trial will be refractory and relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients over the age of 55. The trial size was set at 150 patients with 75 patients per arm. The primary endpoint in the pivotal Phase 3 trial is durable complete remission, defined as a complete remission lasting at least 6 months and the secondary endpoint will be overall survival at one year. There are currently no effective treatments approved by the FDA for AML in this patient population and there is no defined standard of care. Iomab-B has completed several physicians sponsored clinical trials examining its potential as a conditioning regimen prior to HSCT in various blood cancers, including the Phase 1/2 study in relapsed and/or refractory AML patients. The results of these studies in over 300 patients have demonstrated the potential of Iomab-B to create a new treatment paradigm for bone marrow transplants by: expanding the pool to ineligible patients who do not have any viable treatment options currently; enabling a shorter and safer preparatory interval for HSCT; reducing post-transplant complications; and showing a clear survival benefit including curative potential.

&#160; 

Other potential product opportunities in which a significant amount of preclinical work is being undertaken include metastatic colorectal cancer, metastatic prostate cancer and antiangiogenesis which reduces the blood supply to solid tumors. We believe the worldwide market potential for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer is approximately $4.8 billion, and we believe the worldwide market potential for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer is approximately $6.0 billion. We also believe the worldwide market potential for the treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme, a potential indication based on antiangiogenesis approach, is approximately $1.1 billion. 

&#160; 

We believe that our biggest market opportunity lies in the applicability of our APIT platform technology to a wide variety of cancers. A broad range of solid and blood borne cancers can be potentially targeted by mAbs to enable treatment with the APIT technology. The APIT technology could potentially be applied to mAbs that are already approved by the FDA to create more efficacious and/or safer drugs (&#8220;biobetters&#8221;). 

&#160; 

In November 2014, the FDA granted orphan-drug designation for Actimab&#8482;-A. The FDA, through its Office of Orphan Products Development, grants orphan status to drugs and biologic products that are intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Orphan drug designation provides a drug developer with certain benefits and incentives, including a period of marketing exclusivity if regulatory approval is ultimately received for the designated indication; potential tax credits on United States clinical trials; eligibility for orphan drug grants; and waiver of certain administrative fees. 

&#160; 

Our Corporate History and Background 

&#160; 

We were formed as a Nevada corporation on October 6, 1997, originally under the name Zurich U.S.A., Inc. On July 10, 2006, we changed our name to Cactus Ventures, Inc. and began pursuing our business of marketing sunglasses. The Company encountered numerous problems with various vendors and ceased its operations. The Company shifted its efforts to seeking a business combination opportunity with a business entity, and negotiated a merger of a target company into the Company. Upon ceasing its operations, the Company was considered a &#8220;blank check&#8221; or &#8220;Shell&#8221; company as such term is defined under the Securities Act. Upon completing the Share Exchange (as defined below), the Company ceased being considered a &#8220;blank check&#8221; or &#8220;Shell&#8221; company and is now a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing certain cancer treatments. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; 

On April 11, 2013, the change of domicile from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware and the change of Cactus Ventures, Inc.&#8217;s name from Cactus Ventures, Inc. to Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. became effective in accordance with Articles of Merger filed with the State of Nevada and a Certificate of Merger filed with the State of Delaware. In connection with the name change we also changed (i) the name of our subsidiary Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to Actinium Corporation, (ii) our par value to $0.001 per share, and (iii) the number of authorized shares of preferred stock to 10 million shares. Effective April 18, 2013 our new trading symbol became ATNM. On September 25, 2013, we merged with our subsidiary, Actinium Corporation. In January 2014, we increased our authorized shares of common stock to 200 million shares and our authorized shares of preferred stock to 50 million shares. 

&#160; 

Acquisition of Actinium 

&#160; 

On December 28, 2012, Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;Actinium&#8221;) completed a share exchange with Cactus, whereby Cactus acquired 21% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Actinium Corporation from the shareholders of Actinium Corporation (the &#8220;Actinium Shareholders&#8221;) in exchange for the issuance of 4,333,489 shares of Common Stock of the Company to the Actinium Shareholders (the &#8220;Share Exchange&#8221;). As part of the Share Exchange, Actinium Corporation paid $250,000 to the shareholders of Cactus before the consummation of the Share Exchange. 

&#160; 

The Share Exchange was treated as a recapitalization effected through a share exchange, with Actinium Corporation as the accounting acquirer and the Company the accounting acquiree. Unless the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this Report to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the Share Exchange, we are referring to the business and financial information of Actinium Corporation. 

&#160; 

As a result of the Share Exchange, the Company assumed the business and operations of Actinium Corporation. On April 11, 2013, the change of domicile from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware and the change of Cactus Ventures, Inc.&#8217;s name from Cactus Ventures, Inc. to Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. became effective in accordance with Articles of Merger filed with the State of Nevada and a Certificate of Merger filed with the State of Delaware. 

&#160; 

As we are a &#8220;reporting company&#8221; under the Exchange Act of 1934, it is required to file periodic filings with the SEC. 

&#160; 

On March 11, 2013, Actinium Corporation continued its Share Exchange with the Company, whereby we acquired an additional 36% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Actinium Corporation from the Actinium Corporation Shareholders in exchange for the issuance of 7,756,840 shares of Common Stock of the Company to the Actinium Shareholders. On August 22, 2013, Actinium Corporation continued its Share Exchange with the Company, whereby the Company acquired an additional 38.2% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Actinium Corporation from the Actinium Corporation Shareholders in exchange for the issuance of 6,383,475 shares of Common Stock of the Company to the Actinium Shareholders. On September 25, 2013 in accordance with a Certificate of Ownership Merging Actinium Corporation into the Company, the Company merged into itself Actinium Corporation, and Actinium Corporation ceased to exist. As a result of the merger, Actinium Corporation stock owned by the Company has been cancelled and each share of Actinium Corporation not owned by the Company was exchanged for 0.333 shares of Company common stock. 

&#160; 

Corporate History of Actinium 

&#160; 

Actinium Corporation was incorporated in 2000 in the state of Delaware. Until the Share Exchange, Actinium Corporation was a clinical-stage, privately held biopharmaceutical company with: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Two clinical-stage products, Iomab&#8482;-B and Actimab&#8482;-A, in development for blood borne cancers; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Preclinical data in additional cancer indications; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; A proprietary technology platform for novel radioimmunotherapy cancer treatments; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; A proprietary process for manufacturing of the alpha particle emitting radioactive isotope actinium 225 (Ac-225). &#160; 

Actimab&#8482;-A is currently in a Phase 1/2 trial in newly diagnosed elderly AML patients. In addition, using our patented APIT platform and via our collaboration with MSKCC, the Company has preclinical data on potential drug candidates in several other cancer indications and expects to further develop these into clinical stage drug candidates. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; 

Actinium Corporation has one wholly owned subsidiary, MedActinium, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which is party to certain isotope related licenses and contracts on which we rely on. 

&#160; 

Upon Actinium Corporation&#8217;s formation in 2000, it acquired Pharmactinium, Inc. and MedActinium, Inc., and through Pharmactinium, Inc. acquired certain rights to the APIT platform. Core technology patents were in-licensed from N.V. Organon which also provided seed funding. Pharmactinium, Inc. was party to a research and development agreement with MSKCC beginning in 1996. In 2002, this agreement and relationship was significantly expanded and now includes research and development, preclinical development, clinical trials and commercial technology licenses. In 2007, Pharmactinium, Inc. was merged with and into the Company. In 2007, the Company also acquired its sister company, Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Limited (Bermuda) (the &#8220;Bermuda Company&#8221;), by a merger of the Bermuda Company into the Company and thereby also acquired certain patent licenses relating to APIT previously licensed by the Bermuda Company to the Company. 

&#160; 

In 2000, we also began what has become a long term relationship with General Atlantic Investments Limited (GAIL), an entity which provided most of the Company&#8217;s investment capital from 2000 through 2010, totaling $40.8 million. In 2010, the parent of GAIL contributed and transferred its ownership of GAIL (now renamed Actinium Holdings, Limited), whose only asset at that time was the shares of API, to an indirect subsidiary of MSKCC. In January 2012, the Company closed on approximately $6.7 million in net funding through the sale of our stock and a Senior Convertible Note financing. On December 19, 2012, Actinium completed a private offering of units, consisting of common stock, Series A warrants and Series B warrants. The price per unit was $1.65 for aggregate net proceeds of $4.5 million. The Series A Warrants had a 120 day term from January 28, 2013 and were exercisable for an aggregate of up to 3,118,968 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock at an initial per share exercise price of $1.65, subject to adjustment. The Series A Warrants expired on May 28, 2013. The Series B Warrants have a five year term from January 28, 2013 and are exercisable for an aggregate of up to 1,559,484 shares of our common stock at an initial per share exercise price of $2.48, subject to adjustment. In the second quarter of 2013, we issued shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of A-Warrants originally issued in connection with a private placement that closed in December 2012. The warrants were exercised at $1.65 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $3.5 million to the Company.

Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

Actimab&#8482;-A 

&#160; 

Actimab&#8482;-A is currently in multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial in AML. It consists of the monoclonal antibody Lintuzumab and alpha emitting radioisotope actinium 225 (Ac-225). The indication in the ongoing trial is newly diagnosed AML patients over the age of 60. 

&#160; 

Previous clinical trials leading to this trial included: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8212; Phase 1 clinical trial with Bismab-A, the first generation product consisting of the same monoclonal antibody Lintuzumab and Bi-213 alpha emitter, a daughter of Ac-225; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8212; Phase 1/2 clinical trial with Bismab-A, the first generation product consisting of the same monoclonal antibody Lintuzumab and Bi-213 alpha emitter, a daughter of Ac-225; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8212; Dose escalating pilot Phase 1 clinical trial with Actimab&#8482;-A, the current product consisting of the Lintuzumab monoclonal antibody and Ac-225 alpha emitter. &#160; 

Completed Actimab&#8482;-A related clinical trials outcomes: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8212; The Phase 2 arm of the Bismab-A drug study has shown signs of the drug&#8217;s efficacy and safety, including reduction in peripheral blast counts and complete responses in some patients. Bi-213 is a daughter, i.e., product of the degradation of Ac-225, with cancer cell killing properties similar to Ac-225 but is less potent. The Phase 1 Actimab&#8482;-A trial at MSKCC with a single-dose administration of Actimab&#8482;-A showed elimination of leukemia cells from blood in 67% of all evaluable patients who received a full dose and in 83% of those treated at dose levels above 0.5 microcuries per kilogram (&#181;Ci/kg), and eradication of leukemia cells in both blood and bone marrow in 20% of all evaluable patients and 25% of those treated at dose levels above 0.5 &#181;Ci/kg. Maximum tolerated single dose in this trial was established at 3 &#181;Ci/kg. &#160; 

High potency means that a relatively low amount of drug is needed to produce a given effect. In preclinical and Phase 1 clinical studies, Actimab-A ( 225 Ac-lintuzumab) has demonstrated at least 500-1000 times higher potency than the first-generation predecessor ( 213 Bi-lintuzumab) upon which it is based. This difference is due to intrinsic physicochemical properties of Actimab-A that were first established in vitro , in which Actimab-A killed multiple cell lines at doses at least 1000 times lower (based on LD50 values) than Bismab-A analogs. Key factors in Actimab-A&#8217;s higher potency are the yield of 4 alpha-emitting isotopes per 225 Ac (compared to 1 alpha decay for bismuth 213) and much longer half-life (10 day for 225 Ac vs 46 minutes for 213 Bi). 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160; 

In preclinical animal models, doses in the nanocurie range prolonged survival. In humans, Actimab-A was previously studied in a Phase I monotherapy trial of relapsed or refractory AML patients at MSKCC. Dose levels in that study re-confirmed the substantially higher potency of Actimab-A, as compared to equivalent dosing of the first-generation Bismab-A ( 213 Bi-lintuzumab) construct, which had nevertheless established safety and efficacy in a Phase 1/2 trial in high-risk AML with cytoreduction.

&#160; 

Ongoing Actimab&#8482;-A trial: 

&#160; 

We have commenced our first company sponsored Phase 1/2 multi-center trial with fractionated (two) doses of Actimab&#8482;-A, our lead product candidate for treatment of elderly AML that consists of an AML specific monoclonal antibody (HuM195, also known as Lintuzumab&#8482;) and the actinium 225 radioactive isotope attached to it. We are conducting this trial at world-class cancer institutions such as MSKCC, Johns Hopkins Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Health System, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and MD Anderson Cancer Center. 

&#160; 

Bismabt-A trials and the Phase 1 Actimab&#8482;-A trial were focused on relapsed, refractory and other difficult to treat acute myeloid leukemia patients. The current multicenter Phase 1/2 trial is focused on newly diagnosed AML patients who have historically had better outcomes. In addition, the new trial includes low doses of chemotherapy with the goal of further improving patient outcomes. 

&#160; 

Iomab&#8482;-B 

&#160; 

Iomab&#8482;-B is our product currently in preparation for a pivotal Phase 3 multicenter clinical trial. It consists of the monoclonal antibody BC8 and beta emitting radioisotope iodine 131 (I-131). The indication for that trial is bone marrow conditioning for HSCT in relapsed and refractory AML patients over the age of 55. 

&#160; 

Previous Iomab&#8482;-B clinical trials leading to the planned Phase 3 trial currently in preparation included:

Phase 3 Iomab&#8482;-B clinical trial in preparation: 

&#160; 

While we do not have a Special Protocol Assessment from the FDA with respect to our planned Phase 3 trial of Iomab&#8482;-B, we have obtained FDA&#8217;s comment and guidance on the Phase 3 clinical trial design, and the FDA has identified the following design features as generally acceptable, dependent on the results of the trial: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8212; Single pivotal study, pending trial results; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8212; Patient population: refractory AML patients age of 55 and older, where refractory is defined as either primary failure to achieve a complete remission after 2 cycles of induction therapy; relapsed after 6 months in complete remission; second or higher relapse; or relapsed disease not responding to intensive salvage therapy; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8212; Trial arms: study arm and control arm with physician&#8217;s choice of conventional care with curative intent; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8212; Trial size: 150 patients total (75 patients per arm). &#160; 

Operations 

&#160; 

Our current operations are primarily focused on furthering the development of our lead clinical drug candidates Actimab&#8482;-A and Iomab&#8482;-B. In the case of Actimab&#8482;-A, key ongoing activities include progressing a multi-center Phase 1/2 trial, support for an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial at MSKCC, managing isotope and other materials supply chain, and managing the manufacturing of the finished drug candidate product. We have secured access to much of the currently available world reserves of Ac-225 and Bi-213 through a renewable contractual arrangement with the United States Department of Energy (DOE). We project that these quantities are sufficient to support early stages of commercialization of alpha isotopes based products. The Company has also developed its own proprietary process for industrial scale Ac-225 production in a cyclotron in quantities adequate to support full product commercialization. 

&#160; 

Operations related to Iomab&#8482;-B include planning for a Phase 3 pivotal trial (a trial that leads to registration trial marketing approved by the FDA) which will include development of commercial scale manufacturing to be suitable for an approval trial and preparation of appropriate regulatory submissions. 

&#160; 

For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred approximately $13.3 million, $12.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively, on research and development activities. These expenditures consisted of materials maintenance and purchases, supply chain development and implementation, drug candidate manufacturing expenditures, clinical trials costs and intellectual property portfolio related expenses. Since we have no customers, none of the costs of such research and development activities were borne by our customers. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our net loss was approximately $21.0 million, $24.7 million and $10.8 million, respectively. 

&#160;

There are no patents covering Iomab&#8482;-B; however, we have developed a proprietary strategy based on trade secret protection and the potential for orphan drug and data exclusivities. The BC8 antibody, cell line and related know-how has been exclusively licensed by us from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) in exchange for milestones, royalties and research support.

&#160;

Patents related to the antibody component of Actimab-A have been exclusively licensed by us from AbbVie Biotherapeutics Corp. (formerly Abbott Biotherapeutics Corp.) for use with alpha-emitting radioisotopes in exchange for future development and commercialization milestones, a royalty on net sales for a period of 12.5 years from first commercial sale, a negotiation right to be our clinical and/or commercial antibody supplier, a negotiation right to co-promote Actimab&#8482;-A in the United States on terms to be negotiated, and the grant-back of IP rights covering improvements to the antibody for use other than with an alpha-emitting isotope. Patents covering actinium-225 conjugated to antibodies have been exclusively licensed by us from MSKCC in exchange for license fees, research support payments, development milestones, 2% royalties on net sales for the term of the licensed patents or, if later, 10 years from first commercial sale, and 15% of any sublicense income we may receive. We source actinium-225 under an agreement with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) that expires at the end of 2016. We believe, but cannot guarantee, that we will be able to renew this contract for additional annual periods.

&#160; 

Key Strengths 

&#160; 

We believe that the key elements for our market success include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Clinical results to date imply lower development risk for its lead drug candidates: Our lead drug candidates have been tested in over 300 patients and demonstrated favorable safety and efficacy profiles. Iomab&#8482;-B has been administered to more than 250 patients in a number of Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials and has shown a clear survival benefit in the indication for which it is being developed. Bismab&#174;-A and Actimab&#8482;-A, drugs based on the APIT platform have to date been tested in over 60 patients in 3 clinical trials. In each trial they exhibited few side effects and have shown indications of efficacy. The current proof-of-concept Actimab&#8482;-A Phase 1/2 clinical trial is directed at a patient population that is generally easier to treat (newly diagnosed vs. relapsed/refractory in previous trials), and employs a more potent treatment regimen (low dose chemotherapy plus two doses of Actimab&#8482;-A plus low dose chemotherapy vs. a single dose of Actimab&#8482;-A in the physician sponsored trial). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Additional product opportunities from the APIT platform: Our APIT technology has the potential for broad applicability for the treatment of many cancer types, which allows us to add new product candidates to its pipeline based on well-defined patent protected methods. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Collaboration with MSKCC: Our collaboration with MSKCC includes licensing, research and clinical trial arrangements involving MSKCC labs and clinicians and included financial support with respect to certain pre-2012 R&#38;D-related expenses. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Scientific backing of leading experts: Our clinical advisory board and collaborators include some of the most recognized clinicians and scientists working at some of the highest regarded medical institutions in the United States and the world, including MSKCC, Johns Hopkins University, University of Pennsylvania, FHCC and MD Anderson Cancer Center. This is expected to be beneficial to us both in clinical development and market acceptance assuming its drug candidates are approved. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Isotope supply secured for clinical trials: We have a contractual relationship with ORNL of the DOE that provides us access to the largest known supply reserves of actinium 225. Iodine 131 is readily available from a number of qualified pharmaceutical supply vendors. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Proprietary alpha emitting isotope manufacturing technology fully developed: We have developed our own proprietary technology for commercial scale manufacturing of actinium 225. This is expected to ensure commercial supply of Ac-225 for Actimab&#8482;-A, Actimab&#8482;-B and other actinium-linked products should they be approved. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; cGMP Actimab&#8482;-A manufacturing developed: We have developed at a contractor&#8217;s site full cGMP (current good manufacturing practices) manufacturing processes for our drug candidate Actimab&#8482;-A. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Substantial IP portfolio: We have an intellectual property portfolio in excess of 60 patents and patent applications, both in the United States and other countries, which cover clinical applications of the APIT technology and methods of manufacturing actinium 225 thus giving us control over both the applications of our technology and a supply chain of our key ingredients, actinium 225 and bismuth 213 alpha emitting isotopes. &#160; 

Competition Overview 

&#160; 

To our knowledge, there are no other commercial entities that have significant programs in place for developing Ac-225- or Bi-213-based drugs. In the wider field of medical oncology, we face competition from: developers of other alpha emitter based drug candidates, other radioimmunotherapy based technologies, technologies for labeling antibodies with toxic drugs (antibody-drug conjugates), and for each disease indication from all drugs available and/or in development. 

&#160; 

For our lead indication, acute myeloid leukemia, there are a number of companies developing drugs for AML. These drugs are most often small molecules and as such have different safety profiles and mechanisms of action compared to our drug candidates. Acute myeloid leukemia in older patients remains an area of high medical need that could accommodate many new products with favorable safety and efficiency profiles. 

&#160; 

In the field of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, pharmaceuticals currently used for bone marrow ablation/conditioning are generic drugs and to our knowledge there are no significant industry efforts to enter this area, especially in older patients. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Governmental authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing of radioimmunotherapy pharmaceutical products such as those being developed by us. In the United States, the FDA regulates such products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and implements regulations. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements, both before and after approval, may subject us to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160; 

U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation 

&#160; 

Our research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and other countries. Most notably, all of our products sold in the United States are subject to the FDA as implemented and enforced by the FDA. Certain of our product candidates in the United States require FDA pre-marketing approval of a BLA pursuant to 21 C.F.R. &#167; 314. Foreign countries may require similar or more onerous approvals to manufacture or market these products. 

&#160; 

Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or other regulatory authorities, which may result in sanctions, including but not limited to, untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products; operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing or delaying our requests for BLA premarket approval of new products or modified products; withdrawing BLA approvals that have already been granted; and refusal to grant export. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 10, 2016, we have 18 full-time employees. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. We also engage consultants on an as-needed basis to supplement existing staff. &#160;
