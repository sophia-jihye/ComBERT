 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

The Company 

Overview . Jack in the Box Inc., based in San Diego, California, operates and franchises 2,954 &#32;Jack in the Box &#174; &#32;quick-service restaurants (&#8220;QSRs&#8221;) and Qdoba Mexican Eats &#174; ("Qdoba") fast-casual restaurants. References to the Company throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K are made using the first person notations of &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our.&#8221; 

Jack in the Box . Jack in the Box opened its first restaurant in 1951, and has since become one of the nation&#8217;s largest hamburger chains. Based on number of restaurants, our top 10 major markets comprise approximately 70% &#32;of the total system, and Jack in the Box is the second largest QSR hamburger chain in eight of those major markets. As of the end of our fiscal year on October 2, 2016 , the Jack in the Box system included 2,255 &#32;restaurants in 21 &#32;states and Guam, of which 417 &#32;were company-operated and 1,838 &#32;were franchise-operated. 

Qdoba. To supplement our core growth and balance the risk associated with growing solely in the highly competitive hamburger segment of the QSR industry, in 2003 we acquired Qdoba Restaurant Corporation, operator and franchisor of Qdoba Mexican Eats. Qdoba is the second &#32;largest fast-casual Mexican food brand in the United States. As of October 2, 2016 , the Qdoba system included 699 &#32;restaurants in 47 &#32;states, the District of Columbia and Canada, of which 367 &#32;were company-operated and 332 &#32;were franchise-operated. 

Strategic Plan. Our long-term strategic plan focuses on continued growth, increasing average unit volumes (&#8220;AUVs&#8221;), improving restaurant profitability and returns on invested capital, and returning cash to shareholders. 

Through the execution of our refranchising strategy over the last five years, we have increased franchise ownership of the Jack in the Box system from 72% &#32;at the end of fiscal 2011 to 82% &#32;at the end of fiscal 2016 . We plan to increase franchise ownership of the Jack in the Box system to over 90%. In fiscal 2016 , our Jack in the Box franchisees independently developed 12 &#32;new franchise restaurants, and we expect the majority of Jack in the Box new unit growth will be through franchise restaurants. 

Through new unit growth, acquisitions of franchised Qdoba restaurants in select markets, and the refranchising of Jack in the Box restaurants, Qdoba has become a more prominent part of our company restaurant operations. As of the end of fiscal 2016 , Qdoba comprised approximately 47% &#32;of our total company-operated units as compared with approximately 28% at the end of fiscal 2011. We plan to continue to build out the number of Qdoba company locations at an accelerated pace over the next several years. Accelerating the growth of our Qdoba brand by increasing market penetration is anticipated to generate heightened brand awareness. 

Restaurant Concepts 

Jack in the Box . Jack in the Box restaurants offer a broad selection of distinctive products including classic burgers like our Jumbo Jack &#174; burgers, and innovative new product lines such as Buttery Jack &#8482; &#32;burgers and our Brunchfast &#8482; &#32;menu. We also offer tacos, regular and curly fries, specialty sandwiches, salads and real ice cream shakes, among other items. We allow our guests to customize their meals to their tastes and order any product when they want it, including breakfast items any time of day (or night). 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;The Jack in the Box restaurant chain was the first major hamburger chain to develop and expand the concept of drive-thru restaurants. In addition to drive-thru windows, most of our restaurants have seating capacities ranging from 20 to 100 people and are open 18-24 hours a day. Drive-thru sales currently account for approximately 75% &#32;of sales at company-operated restaurants. The average check in fiscal year 2016 &#32;was $7.38 &#32;for company-operated restaurants. 

With a presence in only 21 &#32;states, we believe Jack in the Box is a brand with significant growth opportunities. In fiscal 2016 , we continued to expand in existing markets. We opened four &#32;company-operated restaurants and franchisees opened 12 &#32;Jack in the Box restaurants during the year. In fiscal 2017 , we expect to open approximately 20-25 &#32;new Jack in the Box restaurants system-wide.

Qdoba . Qdoba&#8217;s menu features Mexican-themed food items including burritos, tacos, salads, and quesadillas. Guests can customize their meals by adding 3-cheese queso, guacamole, and a variety of sauces and salsas without paying an extra charge. Our new logo that debuted in fiscal 2016 modifies the full name of our brand from Qdoba Mexican Grill &#174; &#32;to Qdoba Mexican Eats to better reflect the flavors and variety our menu offers. &#32; 

Our restaurants also offer a variety of catering options that can be tailored to feed groups of ten to several hundred. While some of our restaurants serve breakfast, the majority generally operate from 10:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Qdoba restaurants have a seating capacity that ranges from 60 to 80 people, and many locations include outdoor patio seating. In fiscal 2016 , the average check for company-operated restaurants was $11.75 , which excludes catering sales. 

We currently estimate the long-term growth potential for Qdoba to be approximately 2,000 units across the United States. Our company-operated restaurants are generally located in larger market areas. Franchise development is more weighted towards traditional sites, but are also developed in non-traditional sites (airports, campuses, etc.) or areas where local franchisees can operate more efficiently. During fiscal 2016 , we opened 35 &#32;company-operated restaurants and franchisees opened 18 &#32;Qdoba restaurants, including six &#32;non-traditional sites. In fiscal 2017 , we expect to open 60-70 &#32;new Qdoba restaurants system-wide, of which we expect approximately 40 to be company-operated locations. 

The following table summarizes the changes in the number of company-operated and franchise Qdoba restaurants over the past five years:

Site Selection and Design 

Site selections for all new company-operated Jack in the Box and Qdoba restaurants are made after an economic analysis and a review of demographic data and other information relating to population density, traffic, competition, restaurant visibility and access, available parking, surrounding businesses and opportunities for market penetration. Restaurants developed by franchisees are built to brand specifications on sites we have reviewed. 

Each of our brands have multiple restaurant models with different seating capacities to improve our flexibility in selecting locations for our restaurants. Management believes that this flexibility enables the Company to match the restaurant configuration with the specific economic, demographic, geographic or physical characteristics of a particular site. 

Typical costs to develop a traditional Jack in the Box restaurant, excluding the land value, range from $1.2 million &#32;to $2.0 million . The majority of our Jack in the Box restaurants are constructed on leased land or on land that we purchase and subsequently sell, along with the improvements, in sale and leaseback transactions. Upon completion of a sale and leaseback transaction, the Company&#8217;s initial cash investment is reduced to the cost of equipment, which ranges from approximately $0.3 million &#32;to $0.5 million . 

The majority of Qdoba restaurants are located in leased spaces ranging from conventional large-scale retail projects to smaller neighborhood retail strip centers as well as non-traditional locations such as airports, college campuses and food courts. Qdoba restaurant development costs generally range from $0.8 million &#32;to $1.5 million &#32;depending on the type, square footage, geographic region, and if the location includes an expanded alcohol offering. In fiscal 2015, we began testing new restaurant design elements as part of our brand evolution, and in fiscal 2016, we finalized our new restaurant design and approved remodel designs for existing restaurants. 

Franchising Program 

Jack in the Box . The Jack in the Box franchise agreement generally provides for an initial franchise fee of $50,000 &#32;per restaurant for a 20-year term, royalty payments, and marketing fees at 5% &#32;of gross sales. Royalty rates, typically 5% &#32;of gross sales, can range from 1% &#32;to as high as 15% &#32;of gross sales, and some existing agreements provide for variable rates and/or royalty holidays. We may offer development agreements to franchisees for construction of one or more new restaurants over a defined period of time and in a defined geographic area. Developers may be required to pay fees for certain company-sourced new sites. Developers may lose their rights to future development if they do not maintain the required opening schedule. To stimulate growth we have offered lower royalty rates to franchisees who opened restaurants within specified time frames. 

In connection with the sale of a company-operated restaurant to a franchisee, we sell to the franchisee the restaurant equipment and the right to do business at that location for a specified term. The aggregate price is negotiated based upon the value of the restaurant as a going concern, which depends on various factors, including the sales and cash flows of the restaurant, as well as its location and history. In addition, the land and building are generally leased or subleased to the franchisee at a negotiated rent, typically equal to the greater of a minimum base rent or a percentage of gross sales. The franchisee is usually required to pay property taxes, insurance and ancillary costs, and is responsible for maintaining the restaurant. 

Qdoba. Qdoba franchisees are generally charged an initial franchise fee of $30,000 &#32;per restaurant for a 10-year franchise term with a 10-year &#32;option to extend at a fee of $5,000 , royalty payments, and marketing fees of 1.25% &#32;of gross sales. We also require franchisees to spend a minimum of 2% &#32;of gross sales on local marketing for their restaurants. Royalty rates are typically 5% &#32;of gross sales. We offer development agreements to franchisees for the construction of one or more new restaurants over a defined period of time and in a defined geographic area for a development fee, a portion of which may be credited against franchise fees due for restaurants when they are opened. If the developer does not maintain the required schedule of openings, they may forfeit such fees and lose their rights to future development. We continue to pursue non-traditional locations both through multi-location commitments and single unit franchise agreements. Currently, the non-traditional franchise agreements we offer provide for a $15,000 initial franchise fee, and a 6% royalty rate. To enhance our multi unit non-traditional growth, we may offer agreements that provide for lower fees. 

Restaurant Management and Operations 

Jack in the Box and Qdoba restaurants are operated by a company manager or franchise operator who is directly responsible for the operations of the restaurant, including product quality, service, food safety, cleanliness, inventory, cash control and the conduct and appearance of employees. We focus on attracting, selecting, engaging and retaining employees and franchisees who share our passion for creating long-lasting, successful restaurants. 

At both brands, company-operated restaurant managers are supervised by district managers, who are overseen by directors of operations, who report to vice presidents of operations. Under our performance system, vice presidents and directors are eligible for an annual incentive based on achievement of goals related to region level sales, profit, and company-wide performance. District managers and restaurant managers are eligible for quarterly incentives based on growth in restaurant sales and profit and/or certain other operational performance standards. 

Jack in the Box. Company restaurant managers are required to attend extensive management training classes involving a combination of classroom instruction and on-the-job training in specially designated training restaurants. Restaurant managers and supervisory personnel train other restaurant employees in accordance with detailed procedures and guidelines using training aids available at each location. 

Qdoba. The Qdoba Training System is used to provide employees with detailed training by position, from entry level to restaurant manager. Restaurant management are certified to train and develop team members through a series of on the job and workshop training that focus on knowledge, skills and behaviors. The Qdoba Training System certifies achievement for our cooks and line servers who showcase excellence in their positions. Team members must have, or acquire, specific technical and behavioral skills to become certified in all positions. 

Customer Satisfaction 

Company-operated and franchise-operated restaurants devote significant resources toward offering quality food and excellent service at all of our restaurants. One tool we use to help us maintain a high level of customer satisfaction is our Voice of Guest program, which provides restaurant managers, district managers, and franchise operators with ongoing feedback from guests who complete a short guest satisfaction survey via an invitation typically provided on the register receipt. In these surveys, guests rate their satisfaction with key elements of their restaurant experience, including friendliness, food quality, cleanliness, speed of service and order accuracy. In 2016 , the Jack in the Box and Qdoba systems received approximately 2.1 million &#32;and 0.2 million &#32;guest survey responses, respectively. Our Guest Relations Department receives feedback that guests provide via our website, and communicates that feedback to restaurant managers and franchise operators. We also collect guest feedback through social media and other resources. 

Food Safety and Quality 

Our &#8220;farm-to-fork&#8221; food safety and quality assurance programs are designed to maintain high standards for the food products and food preparation procedures used by our vendors and in our restaurants. We maintain product specifications for our ingredients and our Food Safety and Regulatory Compliance Department must approve all suppliers of food products to our restaurants. We use third-party and internal audits to review the food safety management programs of our vendors. We manage food safety in our restaurants through a comprehensive food safety management program that is based on the Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) Food Code requirements. The food safety management program includes employee training, ingredient testing, documented restaurant practices and attention to product safety at each stage of the food preparation cycle. In addition, our food safety management program uses American National Standards Institute certified food safety training programs to train our company and franchise restaurant management employees on food safety practices for our restaurants. 

Supply Chain 

Historically, we provided purchasing and distribution services for our company-operated restaurants and most of our franchise-operated restaurants. Our remaining franchisees purchased product from approved suppliers and distributors. In fiscal 2012, all of our company-operated Qdoba restaurants and approximately 90% of our Qdoba franchisees began utilizing the distribution services of a third-party distributor under a long-term contract, ending February 2017. Since December 2014, the remaining 10% of our Qdoba franchisees have utilized the same third-party distributor under the same long-term contract. We expect to enter into a new long-term agreement with a third-party distributor for all company and franchise Qdoba restaurants in the United States upon expiration of our current contract. 

In July 2012, all of our Jack in the Box company-operated restaurants and approximately 90% &#32;of our Jack in the Box franchisees entered into a long-term contract with another third-party distributor to provide distribution services to our Jack in the Box restaurants through August 2022. Beginning in June 2015, the remaining 10% of our Jack in the Box franchisees decided to use the services of the same third-party distributor under the same long-term contract. 

The primary commodities purchased by our restaurants are beef, poultry, pork, cheese and produce. We monitor the primary commodities we purchase in order to minimize the impact of fluctuations in price and availability, and we may enter into purchasing contracts and pricing arrangements when we consider them advantageous. However, certain commodities remain subject to price fluctuations. We believe all essential food and beverage products are available, or can be made available, upon short notice from alternative qualified suppliers. 

Information Systems 

At our shared services corporate support center, we have centralized financial accounting systems, human resources and payroll systems, and a communications and network infrastructure that supports both Jack in the Box and Qdoba corporate functions. Our restaurant software allows for daily polling of sales, inventory and other data from the restaurants directly. Our company restaurants and traditional site franchise restaurants use standardized Windows-based touch screen point-of-sale (&#8220;POS&#8221;) platforms. These platforms allow the restaurants to accept cash, credit cards and our re-loadable gift cards. Our Qdoba POS system is also enhanced with an integrated guest loyalty program as well as a takeout and delivery interface. The takeout and delivery interface is used to manage online and catering orders which are distributed to sites via a hosted online ordering website. 

We have business intelligence systems that provide visibility to the key metrics in the operation of company and franchise restaurants. These systems play an integral role in accumulating and analyzing market information. Our company restaurants use labor scheduling systems to assist managers in managing labor hours based on forecasted sales volumes. We also have inventory management systems which enable timely and accurate deliveries of food and packaging to our restaurants. To support order accuracy and speed of service, our drive-thru Jack in the Box restaurants use color order confirmation screens. We have plans to consolidate our restaurant level technologies at Jack in the Box and Qdoba restaurants. 

Advertising and Promotion 

Jack in the Box. &#32;At Jack in the Box, we build brand awareness through our marketing and advertising programs and activities. These activities are supported primarily by financial contributions to a marketing fund from all company and franchise restaurants based on a percentage of gross sales. Activities to advertise restaurant products, promote brand awareness and attract customers include, but are not limited to, system and regional campaigns on television, radio and print media, as well as digital and social media. 

Qdoba. &#32;&#32;At Qdoba, our marketing and advertising programs are designed to build brand awareness, lift restaurant traffic, and increase brand advocacy. All company and franchise restaurants financially contribute a percentage of gross sales to fund the production and development of national and regional radio, print, and digital and social media. Advertising is created at the brand level and the system operators can utilize these assets, or tap into our in-house creative services group to create custom advertising that meets their particular communication objectives while adhering to brand standards. Additionally, the brand is piloting an affinity and mobile platform designed to inspire, motivate and reward increased frequency among Qdoba guests. 

Employees 

At October 2, 2016 , we had approximately 22,200 &#32;employees, of whom 21,500 &#32;were restaurant employees, 500 &#32;were corporate personnel, and 200 &#32;were field management or administrative personnel. Employees are paid on an hourly basis, except certain restaurant management, operations and corporate management, and administrative personnel. We employ both full- and part-time restaurant employees in order to provide the flexibility necessary during peak periods of restaurant operations. We have not experienced any significant work stoppages, and we support our employees, including part-time workers, by offering industry competitive wages and benefits.

Trademarks and Service Marks 

The Jack in the Box, Qdoba Mexican Eats, Qdoba Mexican Grill and Qdoba names are of material importance to us, and each is a registered trademark and service mark in the United States and elsewhere. In addition, we have registered or applied to register numerous service marks and trade names for use in our businesses, including the Jack in the Box logo, Qdoba logos, Qdoba Mexican Grill mark and various product names and designs. 

Seasonality 

Restaurant sales and profitability are subject to seasonal fluctuations because of factors such as vacation and holiday travel and events, seasonal weather conditions, and crises, all of which affect the public&#8217;s dining habits. 

Competition and Markets 

The restaurant business is highly competitive and is affected by local and national economic conditions, including unemployment levels, population and socioeconomic trends, traffic patterns, local and national competitive changes, changes in consumer dining habits and preferences, and new information regarding diet, nutrition and health, all of which may affect consumer spending habits. Key elements of competition in the industry are the quality and innovation in the food products offered, price and perceived value, quality of service experience (including technological and other innovations), speed of service, personnel, advertising and other marketing efforts, name identification, restaurant location, and image and attractiveness of the facilities. 

Each Jack in the Box and Qdoba restaurant competes directly and indirectly with a large number of national and regional restaurant chains, some of which have significantly greater financial resources, as well as with locally-owned and/or independent restaurants in the quick-service and the fast-casual segments, and other consumer options including grocery and specialty stores, catering and delivery services. In selling franchises, we compete with many other restaurant franchisors, some of whom have substantially greater financial resources.

Regulation 

Each restaurant is subject to regulation by federal agencies, as well as licensing and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, safety, fire, zoning, building, taxing and other agencies and departments. Restaurants are also subject to rules and regulations imposed by owners and/or operators of shopping centers, college campuses, airports, military bases or other locations where a restaurant is located. Difficulties or failures in obtaining and maintaining any required permits, licenses or approvals, or difficulties in complying with applicable rules and regulations, could result in restricted operations, closures of existing restaurants, delays or cancellations in the opening of new restaurants, increased cost of operations or the imposition of fines and other penalties. 

We are also subject to federal, state and international laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises, as well as judicial and administrative interpretations of such laws. Such laws impose registration and disclosure requirements on franchisors in the offer and sale of franchises, and may also apply substantive standards to the relationship between franchisor and franchisee, including limitations on the ability of franchisors to terminate franchises and alter franchise arrangements. 

We are subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and various state laws governing such matters as minimum wages, exempt status classification, overtime, breaks and other working conditions for company employees. Our franchisees are subject to these same laws. Many of our food service personnel are paid at rates set in relation to the federal and state minimum wage laws and, accordingly, changes in the minimum wage requirements may increase labor costs for us and our franchisees. Federal and state laws may also require us to provide paid and unpaid leave to our employees, or healthcare or other employee benefits, which could result in significant additional expense to us and our franchisees. We are also subject to federal immigration laws requiring compliance with work authorization documentation and verification procedures. 

We are subject to certain guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and various state codes and regulations, which require restaurants to provide full and equal access to persons with physical disabilities. 

We are also subject to various federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. The cost of complying with these laws increases the cost of operating existing restaurants and developing new restaurants. Additional costs relate primarily to the necessity of obtaining more land, landscaping, storm drainage control and the cost of more expensive equipment necessary to decrease the amount of effluent emitted into the air, ground and surface waters. 

Some of our Qdoba restaurants sell alcoholic beverages, which require licensing. The regulations governing licensing may impose requirements on licensees including minimum age of employees, hours of operation, and advertising and handling of alcoholic beverages. The failure of a Qdoba restaurant to obtain or retain a license could adversely affect the store&#8217;s results of operations. 

We have processes in place to monitor compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing our company operations.
