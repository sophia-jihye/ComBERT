(a) Business Development 

&#160; 

George Risk Industries, Inc. (GRI or the company) was incorporated in 1967 in Colorado. The company is presently engaged in the design, manufacture, and sale of computer keyboards, push button switches, burglar alarm components and systems, pool alarms, thermostats, EZ Duct wire covers and water sensors. 

&#160; 

Products, Market, and Distribution 

&#160;

The company designs, manufactures, and sells computer keyboards, push-button switches, burglar alarm components and systems, pool alarms, and water sensors. Our security burglar alarm products comprise approximately 95 percent of net revenues and are sold through distributors and alarm dealers/installers.

&#160;

The security segment has approximately 1,000 current customers. One of the distributors, ADI (which is a division of Honeywell International), accounts for approximately 41.3 percent of the company&#8217;s sales of these products. Tri-Ed Distribution accounts for another 11.8 percent of company sales. Loss of these distributors would be significant to the company. However, both companies have purchased from the company for many years and are expected to continue. Also, the company has obtained a written agreement with ADI. This agreement was signed in February 2011 and initiated by the customer. The contents of the agreement include product terms, purchasing, payment terms, term and termination, product marketing, representations and warranties, product support, mutual confidentiality, indemnification and insurance, and general provisions.

&#160;

The keyboard segment has approximately 800 customers. Keyboard products are sold to original equipment manufacturers to their specifications and to distributors of off-the-shelf keyboards of proprietary design.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

The company has intense competition in the keyboard and burglar alarm lines. 

&#160; 

The burglar alarm segment has approximately eight major competitors. The company competes well based on price, product design, quality, customization and prompt delivery. 

&#160; 

The competitors in the keyboard segment are larger companies with automated production facilities. GRI has emphasized small custom order sales that many of its competitors decline or discourage. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

The company performs research and development for its customers when needed and requested. Costs in connection with such product development have been borne by the customers. Costs associated with the development of new products are expensed as incurred. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

GRI has approximately 145 employees.
