 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

Our Company 

Mercury Systems, Inc. is a leading commercial provider of secure processing subsystems designed and made in the U.S.A. Optimized for customer and mission success, our solutions power a wide variety of critical defense and intelligence programs. Headquartered in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, we are pioneering a next-generation defense electronics business model specifically designed to meet the industry's current and emerging technology and business needs. We deliver affordable innovative solutions, rapid time-to-value and service and support to our defense prime contractor customers. Our products and solutions have been deployed in more than 300 programs with over 25 different defense prime contractors. Key programs include Aegis, Patriot, Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (&#8220;SEWIP&#8221;), Gorgon Stare, Predator, F-35 and Reaper. Our organizational structure allows us to deliver capabilities that combine technology building blocks and deep domain expertise in the defense sector. 

Our technologies and capabilities include embedded processing modules and subsystems, radio frequency (&#8220;RF&#8221;) and microwave multi-function assemblies as well as subsystems, and RF and microwave components. We utilize leading edge, high performance computing technologies architected by leveraging open standards and open architectures to address highly data-intensive applications that include data signal, sensor and image processing; all of this while addressing the packaging challenges, often referred to as &#8220;SWaP&#8221; (size, weight, and power) that are common in military applications. In addition, we design and build RF and microwave components and subsystems to meet the needs of the electronic warfare (&#8220;EW&#8221;), signals intelligence (&#8220;SIGINT&#8221;) and other high bandwidth communications requirements and applications. 

We also provide significant capabilities relating to pre-integrated, open, affordable EW, electronic attack (&#8220;EA&#8221;) and electronic counter measure (&#8220;ECM&#8221;) subsystems, SIGINT and electro-optical/infrared (&#8220;EO/IR&#8221;) processing technologies, and radar environment test and simulation systems. We deploy these solutions on behalf of defense prime contractors and the Department of Defense (&#8220;DoD&#8221;), leveraging commercially available technologies and solutions (or &#8220;building blocks&#8221;) from our business and other commercial suppliers. We leverage this technology to design and build integrated sensor processing subsystems, often including classified application-specific software and intellectual property (&#8220;IP&#8221;) for the C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), EW, and ECM markets. We bring significant domain expertise to customers, drawing on over 25 years of experience in EW, SIGINT, and radar environment test and simulation. 

We deliver capabilities that combine technology building blocks, deep domain expertise in the defense sector and critical solution areas, and specialized skills in serving the DoD and the intelligence community. 

Our revenues, income from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2016 &#32;were $270.2 million , $19.7 million &#32;and $57.3 million , respectively. Our revenues, income from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2015 &#32;were $234.8 million , $14.4 million &#32;and $44.4 million , respectively. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this annual report for a reconciliation of our adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) from continuing operations. 

Recent Developments 

On May 2, 2016, we acquired the custom microelectronics, RF and microwave solutions, and embedded security operations from Microsemi Corporation (the &#8220;Carve-Out Business&#8221;), resulting in the entities comprising the Carve-Out Business becoming 100% owned direct or indirect subsidiaries of Mercury (the &#8220;Acquisition&#8221;). Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we paid $300.0 million in cash on a cash-free, debt-free basis, subject to working capital and other post-closing adjustments. 

Net sales for the Carve-Out Business were $99.4 million and $87.2 million for its fiscal years ended September 27, 2015 and September 28, 2014, respectively, net income (loss) were $6.4 million and ($3.1) million for its fiscal years ended September 27, 2015 and September 28, 2014, respectively. 

The Carve-Out Business is a leader in the design, development, and production of sophisticated electronic subsystems and components for use in high-technology products for defense and aerospace markets. The Carve-Out Business&#8217; defense electronics solutions include high-density memory modules, secure solid-state drives, secure GPS receiver modules, high-power RF amplifiers, 

millimeter-wave modules and subsystems, and specialized software and firmware for anti-tamper applications. The Carve-Out Business&#8217; customers, which include many significant defense prime contractors, outsource many of their electronic design and manufacturing requirements to the Carve-Out Business as a result of its specialized capabilities in packaging electronics for SWaP-constrained environments, its focus on security and the unique requirements of defense applications, and its expertise in RF and microwave technologies. The Carve-Out Business&#8217; products and technologies are used in a variety of defense applications, including missiles and precision munitions, fighter and surveillance aircraft, airport security portals, and advanced electronic systems for radar and EW. 

Strategic Rationale for the Acquisition 

We believe that the Acquisition will provide several significant strategic and operational benefits to us, including: 

&#8226; 

creating the defense industry&#8217;s largest commercial embedded secure processing company; 

&#8226; 

adding secure solid-state drive (&#8220;SSDs&#8221;) capabilities to our industry leading pre-integrated sensor processing subsystems; 

&#8226; 

increasing our existing RF and microwave business by approximately 66% and adding new capabilities, scale and synergies; 

&#8226; 

adding new capabilities in embedded security and custom microelectronics; and 

&#8226; 

providing access to new high-growth markets, customers and programs, such as precision-guided munitions and missiles. 

Key elements of our strategy to accomplish our continued growth objectives following the Acquisition include: 

&#8226; 

Achieve Design Wins on High-growth, High-priority Defense Programs. We believe our advanced embedded sensor processing solutions position us well going forward to capture design wins on key high-growth, high-priority defense programs within our targeted segments of the C4ISR market. We have won designs in persistent ISR related signals intelligence-payloads on unmanned aerial vehicles (&#8220;UAVs&#8221;) and other aerial platforms. As a result of these successes, we now have significant content on major UAV platforms, including Global Hawk, Predator, Triton, Reaper and Gorgon Stare. Our ballistic missile defense wins include additional designs on the Aegis program, as well as wins on the Patriot missile program. In EW, we have won key designs related to the U.S. Navy&#8217;s SEWIP program and the Ships Signal Exploitation Equipment (&#8220;SSEE&#8221;) programs. Additional wins in the critical EW space include the Navy&#8217;s Filthy Badger and Filthy Buzzard programs, focusing on vulnerability assessment and training for manned aircraft. Together, these wins represent substantial opportunity for us in the years ahead. 

&#8226; 

Continue to Provide Excellent Performance on Our Existing Programs. The foundation for our growth remains our continued involvement with existing programs that are in late-stage development or currently in production. Such programs include Aegis, SEWIP, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Patriot missile, the F-16 and F-15 aircrafts, the Global Hawk, Predator and Reaper UAVs, the P-8 Multimission Maritime Aircraft as well as the Suite of Integrated Radio Frequency Countermeasures (&#8220;SIRFC&#8221;) program. As part of a long-term reprioritization, the DoD is shifting its emphasis from major new weapons systems development to upgrades of existing programs and platforms. We believe the upgrades on these programs focus on four key areas: improved sensors; more advanced on-board embedded computing; enhanced ISR algorithms; and better communications on and off the platform. A key element of our strategy is to continue to provide high-performance, cost-effective solutions on these programs and for these customers. 

&#8226; 

Pursue Additional Strategic, Capability-Enhancing Acquisitions. We will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions to augment our businesses using the following strategies: adding technologies or products that expand our core business by competing more effectively in the C4I, Radar, EW, and missile-defense markets; adding content and services to the defense programs and platforms in which we currently participate or could participate in the future; and enhancing key customer relationships and forming relationships with potential new customers. Our acquisition strategy also focuses on scaling our operations and broadening our program and customer base. 

&#8226; 

Capitalize on Outsourcing and Other Dynamics in the Defense Industry. We are well-positioned to take advantage of several changing dynamics in the defense industry. Defense prime contractors are increasingly being awarded firm fixed-price contracts. These contracts shift risk to the defense prime contractors, and as a result they are beginning to outsource increasing levels of subsystem development and production and other higher value program content. In addition, the U.S. government is shifting toward shorter program timelines, which require increased flexibility and responsiveness from defense prime contractors. Finally, more programs are moving to open systems architectures that enable best-of-breed capabilities. We believe that these dynamics will result in defense prime contractors outsourcing increasing levels of program content to us as a provider of an increasingly wide array of differentiated products, subsystems engineering services and system integration. 

&#8226; 

Leverage Our Research and Development Efforts to Anticipate Market Needs and Maintain our Technology Leadership. We devote significant resources in order to anticipate the future requirements in our target defense markets, 

including monitoring and pioneering advances in advanced embedded computing hardware, security, and software, anticipating changes in U.S. government spending and procurement practices and leveraging insight from direct interaction with our customers. Our high-performance, quick reaction subsystems and capabilities require increasingly sophisticated hardware, software and middleware technology. In addition, as the defense industry shifts to products with open systems architectures, we believe that our software expertise will become increasingly important and differentiates us from many of our competitors as we have the ability to rapidly map complex algorithms onto SWaP-constrained on-board embedded sensor-processing solutions. We have invested in faster product development velocity, aligning with the U.S. government&#8217;s demands on the defense prime contractors for quick reaction capabilities. By shortening our product development times, we are able to quickly launch the products we need to win new designs from the defense prime contractor community. We intend to continue utilizing company and customer-funded research and development, as well as our acquisition strategy, to develop technologies, products and solutions that have significant potential for near-term and long-term value creation in the defense industry. 

We expect to realize aggregate annualized cost synergies from the Acquisition of approximately $10.0 million per year by fiscal 2020. We expect to achieve approximately $2.0 million of those annualized cost savings by the end of fiscal 2017 and an aggregate of approximately $6.0 million of annualized savings by the end of fiscal 2018. Synergies are expected to be derived from sources such as manufacturing efficiencies, alignment of sales models and channel, and increased purchasing power. 

During fiscal 2016, we completed a series of important internal organizational changes in order to integrate, align and scale ourselves into one business. In addition, over the past several years, we have completed several acquisitions, culminating with the Acquisition on May 2, 2016 to support our strategy of creating a better alternative for affordable, secure processing subsystems designed and made in the U.S.A. These strategic acquisitions and the associated operational and managerial changes finalized the transformation of the way the Company's executive management team, including the CEO as the chief operating decision maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;), manage, evaluate and review the business, including how the CODM allocates resources and assesses performance. Therefore, during the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2016, we eliminated the use of Mercury Commercial Electronics ("MCE") and Mercury Defense Systems (&#8220;MDS&#8221;) as reportable segments because the analogous operating segments ceased to exist. We are now comprised of one operating and reportable segment. We utilized the management approach for determining our operating segment in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Boards (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 280, Segment Reporting (&#8220;FASB ASC 280&#8221;). 

On December 16, 2015, we acquired Lewis Innovative Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;LIT&#8221;) for $10.0 million in cash on a cash-free, debt-free basis, subject to working capital and other post-closing adjustments. Embedded systems security has become a requirement for new and emerging military programs, and LIT&#8217;s security solutions significantly extend our capabilities and leadership in secure embedded computing, a critical differentiator from our traditional competition. LIT&#8217;s solutions, combined with our next-generation secure Intel server-class product line, together with increasingly frequent mandates from the government to secure electronic systems for domestic and foreign military sales, position us well to capitalize on DoD program protection security requirements. 

Our Market Opportunity 

Our market opportunity is defined by the growing demand for domestically designed and manufactured secure sensor and mission processing capabilities for critical defense and intelligence applications. Historically, our primary market has been centered on bringing commercially available technologies to the defense sector, specifically C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), EW, and ballistic missile defense; and commercial markets, which include commercial communications and other commercial computing applications. We believe we are well-positioned in growing, sustainable market segments of the defense sector that rely on advanced technologies to improve warfighter capability and provide enhanced force protection capabilities. The Acquisition will further improve our ability to successfully compete in these market segments by allowing us to offer an even more comprehensive set of closely related capabilities. 

We believe there are a number of evolving trends that are reshaping our target markets and accordingly provide us with attractive growth opportunities. These trends include: 

&#8226; 

The defense electronics market is expected to grow in government fiscal 2017 and beyond as requested in President Obama&#8217;s recent budget submission. &#160; According to The Teal Group, world defense electronics funding available to the U.S. was approximately $34.9 billion in fiscal 2016, or approximately 6.7% of the government fiscal 2016 appropriated U.S. DoD base budget. The defense electronics market is projected to increase to $36.6 billion in government fiscal 2017. Within the context of the overall defense budget and spending for defense electronics specifically we believe ISR, EW and ballistic missile defense have a high priority for future DoD spending. We continue to build on our strengths in the design and development of performance optimized electronic subsystems for the ISR and EW markets. As a leader in these markets, we often team with multiple defense prime contractors as they bid for projects, thereby increasing our chance of a successful outcome. 

&#8226; 

The rapidly expanding demand for tactical ISR is leading to significant growth in sensor data being generated, leading to even greater demand for the capability of our products to securely store and process data onboard platforms. &#160; An 

increase in the prevalence and resolution of ISR sensors is generating significant growth in the associated data that needs to be stored and turned into information for the warfighter in a timely manner. In addition, several factors are driving the defense and intelligence industries to demand greater capability to collect, store, and process data onboard the aircraft, UAVs, ships and other vehicles, which we refer to collectively as platforms. These factors include the limited communications bandwidth of existing platforms, the need for platforms that can operate more autonomously and possibly in denied communications environments, the need for platforms with increased persistency to enable them to remain in or fly above the battlefield for extended periods, and the need for greater onboard processing capabilities. 

&#8226; 

Rogue nations&#8217; missile programs and threats from peer nations are causing greater investment in advanced new radar, EW and ballistic missile defense capabilities. There are a number of new and emerging threats, such as peer nations developing stealth technologies, including stealth aircraft, new anti-ship ballistic missiles that potentially threaten the U.S. naval fleet, and a variety of other advanced missile capabilities. Additionally, U.S. armed forces require enhanced signals intelligence and jamming capabilities. In response to these emerging threats, we have participated in key DoD programs, including Aegis, Patriot, SEWIP, LRDR, F-22 Raptor, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and upgrade programs for the F-15 and F-16. 

&#8226; 

The long-term DoD budget pressure is pushing more dollars toward upgrades of the electronic subsystems on existing platforms, which may increase demand for our products. The DoD is moving from major new weapons systems developments to upgrades of the electronic subsystems on existing platforms. These upgrades are expected to include more sensors, signal processing, ISR algorithms, multi-intelligence fusion and exploitation, computing and communications. We believe that upgrades to provide new urgent war fighting capability, driven by combatant commanders, are occurring more rapidly than traditional defense prime contractors can easily react to. We believe these trends will cause defense prime contractors to increasingly seek out our high-performance, cost-effective open architecture products. 

&#8226; 

Defense procurement reform is causing the defense prime contractors to outsource more work to commercial companies . According to the VDC Webcast: Budgetary &#38; Strategic Shifts-Creating Opportunities for Merchant Embedded COTS Systems in Mil/Aero, the portion of the defense electronics market that is captive to the defense primes is estimated to be $35.1 billion and the portion in the merchant market is estimated to be $1.9 billion. The U.S. government is intensely focused on making systems more affordable and shortening their development time. As a company that provides commercial items to the defense industry, we believe our products and subsystem solutions are often more affordable than solutions with the same functionality developed by a defense prime contractor. Several DoD and prime contractor factors are providing incentives for defense prime contractors to outsource more work to subcontractors with significant expertise and cost-effective technology capabilities, and we have transformed our business model over the last several years to address these long-term outsourcing trends and other needs. 

&#8226; 

DoD security and program protection requirements are creating new opportunities for our advanced secure processing capabilities. &#160; The government is focused on ensuring that the U.S. military protects its defense electronic systems and the information held within from nefarious activities such as tampering, reverse engineering, and other forms of advanced attacks. The requirement to add security comes at a time when the commercial technology world continues to offshore more of the design, development, manufacturing, and support of such capabilities, making it more difficult to protect against tampering, reverse engineering and other undesired activities. The DoD has a mandate to ensure both the provenance and integrity of the technology and its associated supply chain. These factors have created a unique opportunity for us to expand beyond sensor processing into the provision of advanced secure processing subsystems and capabilities for other on-board critical compute applications-all designed, developed, manufactured, and supported in the U.S.A. In addition, advanced systems sold to foreign military buyers also require protection so that the technologies, techniques and data associated with them do not become more widely available, which further enhances our market opportunity. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe the following competitive strengths will allow us to take advantage of the evolving trends in our industry and successfully pursue our business strategy: 

&#8226; 

Subsystem Solutions Provider for the C4ISR and EW Markets. Through our commercially developed, specialized processing subsystem solutions, we address the challenges associated with the collection and processing of massive, continuous streams of data and dramatically shorten the time that it takes to give information to U.S. armed forces at the tactical edge. Our solutions are specifically designed for flexibility and interoperability, allowing our products to be easily integrated into larger system-level solutions. Our ability to integrate subsystem-level capabilities allows us to provide solutions that most effectively address the mission-critical challenges within the C4ISR market, including multi-intelligence data fusion and intelligence processing onboard the platform. We leverage our deep expertise in embedded multi-computing, embedded sensor processing, with the addition of our RF and microwave subsystems and components, along with strategic investments in research and development to provide solutions across the sensor processing chain. 

Our deep domain knowledge within the Company rounds out our capabilities and services to our prime contractor and DoD customers. The Acquisition adds both depth and breadth to our capabilities and offerings, and also opens new market opportunities such as missiles, precision guided munitions and homeland security. 

&#8226; 

Diverse Mix of Stable, Growth Programs Aligned with DoD Funding Priorities. Our products and solutions have been deployed on more than 300 different programs and over 25 different defense prime contractors. We serve high priority markets for the DoD and foreign militaries, such as UAVs, ballistic missile defense, airborne reconnaissance, EW, ECM, and have secured positions on mission-critical programs including Aegis, Predator and Reaper UAVs, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Patriot missile, and SEWIP. In addition, we consistently leverage our technology and capabilities across 15 to 20 programs on an annual basis, providing significant operating leverage and cost savings. The Acquisition allows us to participate in a broader array of programs, many with customers that are already key strategic customers of ours. 

&#8226; 

We are a leading commercial provider of secure processing subsystems designed and made in the U.S.A. We have a portfolio of open system architecture (&#8220;OSA&#8221;) technology building blocks across the entire sensor processing chain. We offer embedded secure processing capabilities with advanced packaging and cooling technologies that ruggedize commercial technologies while allowing them to stay cool for reliable operation. These capabilities allow us to help our customers meet the demanding SWaP requirements of today&#8217;s defense platforms. Our pre-integrated subsystems improve affordability by substantially reducing customer system integration costs and time-to-market for our solutions. System integration costs are one of the more substantial costs our customers bear in developing and deploying technologies in defense programs and platforms. Our pre-integrated solutions approach allows for more rapid and affordable modernization of existing platforms and faster deployment of new platforms. 

Our strengths in this area include our position as an early and leading advocate for OSA in defense, offering Intel server class processing form factors across 3/6U OpenVPX, ATCA and rack-mount architectures, and high density, secure solutions across multiple hardware architectures to seamlessly scale to meet our customer&#8217;s SWaP requirements. In addition, we have a 30-year legacy of system management and system integration expertise that allows us to reduce technical risk, while improving affordability and interoperability. Our system integration expertise is a cornerstone in helping us support our customers in deploying pre-integrated, OSA subsystems. 

&#8226; 

We provide advanced, integrated security features for our products and subsystems, addressing an increasingly prevalent requirement for DoD program security. We offer secure processing expertise that is built-in to our pre-integrated subsystems, not bolted on. By doing this we are able to provide secure building blocks that allow our customers to incorporate their own security capabilities. This assists our customers in ensuring program protection as they deploy critical platforms and programs, all in support of DoD missions. The Acquisition will bring us new security technologies and also allow us to provide enhanced security capabilities in areas such as memory and storage devices. The Acquisition also provides us with a DMEA-(&#8220;Defense Micro-Electronics Association&#8221;) certified trusted manufacturing facility for microelectronics in the Carve-Out Business&#8217; Phoenix, Arizona facility. 

&#8226; 

We are pioneering a next generation business model. The defense industrial base is currently undergoing a major transformation. Domestic political and budget uncertainty, geopolitical instability and evolving global threats have become constants. The defense budget, while stabilized in the short term, remains under pressure and R&#38;D and technology spending are often in budgetary competition with the increasing costs of military personnel requirements, health care costs, and other important elements within the DoD and the federal budget generally. Finally, defense acquisition reform, under the banner of Better Buying Power 3.0 calls for the continued drive for innovation and competition within the defense industrial base, while also driving down acquisition cost. Our approach is built around a few key pillars: 

&#8226; 

We continue to leverage our expertise in building pre-integrated subsystems in support of critical defense programs, driving out procurement costs by lowering integration expenses of our customers. 

&#8226; 

We have been a pioneer in driving open systems architectures. 

&#8226; 

The DoD has asked defense industry participants to invest their own resources into R&#38;D. This approach is a pillar of our business model. 

&#8226; 

Security and program protection are now critical considerations for both program modernizations as well as for new program deployment. We are now in our third generation of building secure embedded processing solutions. 

We have a next generation business model built to meet the emerging needs of the DoD. 

&#8226; 

Value-Added Subsystem Solution Provider for Defense Prime Contractors. Because of the DoD&#8217;s shift towards a firm fixed price contract procurement model, an increasingly uncertain budgetary and procurement environment, and increased budget pressures from both the U.S. and allied governments, defense prime contractors are accelerating their move toward outsourcing opportunities to help mitigate the increased program and financial risk. Our differentiated advanced sensor processing solutions offer meaningful capabilities upgrades for our customers and enable the rapid, cost-effective 

deployment of systems to the end customer. We believe our open architecture subsystems offer differentiated sensor processing and data analytics capabilities that cannot be easily replicated. Our solutions minimize program risk, maximize application portability, and accelerate customers&#8217; time to market, all within a fixed-pricing contracting environment. 

&#8226; 

Delivery of Platform-Ready Solutions for Classified Programs. We believe our integration work through our Cypress, California facility provides us with critical insights as we implement and incorporate key classified government intellectual property, including critical intelligence and signal processing algorithms, into advanced systems. This integration work provides us the opportunity to directly combine and integrate our technology building blocks along with our intellectual property into our existing embedded processing products and solutions, enabling us to deliver more affordable, platform-ready integrated ISR subsystems that leverage our OSA and address key government technology and procurement concerns. Our operations in this environment also help us identify emerging needs and opportunities to influence our future product development, so that critical future needs can be met in a timely manner with commercially-developed products and solutions. 

&#8226; 

Advanced Microelectronics Centers. Our Advanced Microelectronics Centers (&#8220;AMCs&#8221;) in Hudson, New Hampshire and West Caldwell, New Jersey, design, build and test both RF and microwave components and subsystems in support of a variety of key customer programs. With our fiscal 2014 move into our new AMC in Hudson, New Hampshire, including the installation of integrated business systems into both our AMCs, we have a platform for scalable, continued growth in our RF and microwave product lines. Our scalable microelectronics manufacturing operations at our AMCs enable rapid, cost-effective deployment of RF and microwave solutions to our customers. The Acquisition will give us a west coast location providing similar advanced capabilities and better proximity to certain key customer locations. 

&#8226; 

Long-Standing Industry Relationships . We have established long-standing relationships with defense prime contractors, the U.S. government and other key organizations in the defense industry over our 30 years in the defense electronics industry. Our customers include BAE Systems, the Boeing Company, Harris, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and Raytheon Company. Over this period, we have become recognized for our ability to develop new technologies and meet stringent program requirements. We believe we are well-positioned to maintain these high-level customer engagements and enhance them through the additional relationships that the Carve-Out Business has with many of the same customers. 

&#8226; 

Proven Management Team. Over the past several years, our senior management team has refocused the Company on its economic core, developed a long-term compelling strategy for the defense markets and restored profitability to the business. Having completed these critical steps to rebuild the Company and with a senior management team with significant experience in growing and scaling businesses, both through operating execution and acquisitions, we believe that we have demonstrated our operational capabilities and we are well-positioned for the next phase to transform, grow and scale our business. 

Our Business Strategy 

Our strategy is built around our key strengths as a leading commercial provider of secure and processing subsystems designed and made in the U.S.A. Optimized for customer and mission success, our solutions power a wide variety of critical defense and intelligence programs. We are pioneering a next-generation defense electronics business model specifically designed to meet the industry&#8217;s current and emerging technology needs. By driving this strategy consistently, we are able to help our customers, mostly defense prime contractors, reduce program cost, minimize technical risk, and stay on schedule and on budget. Tactically, we have a reputation of relentless execution on behalf of our customers that supports the successful evolution of our strategy. 

We intend to accelerate our strategic direction through continued investment in advanced new products and solutions development in the fields of radio frequency, analog-to-digital and digital to analog conversion, advanced multi- and many-core sensor processing systems including GPUs, embedded security, digital storage, and digital radio frequency memory (&#8220;DRFM&#8221;) solutions, software defined communications capabilities, and advanced security technologies and capabilities. We leverage our engineering development services including systems integration to accelerate our move to become a commercial outsourcing partner to the large defense prime contractors as they seek the more rapid design, development and delivery of affordable, commercially-developed, open sensor processing solutions within the markets we serve. Our services-led engagements can help lead to long-term production subsystem revenues that will continue long after the initial services are delivered. This business model positions us to be paid for non-recurring engineering work we would have previously expensed through our own income statement, to team concurrently with multiple defense prime contractors as they pursue new business with the unique solutions they develop and market to the government, and to engage with our customers much earlier in the design cycle and ahead of our competition. In fiscal 2016, we have substantially added to our technology portfolio by adding capabilities in secure embedded computing, with the acquisition of LIT and a variety of defense applications with the acquisition of the Carve-Out Businesses, including missiles and precision munitions, fighter and surveillance aircraft, airport security portals, and advanced electronic systems for radar and EW. 

Our Solutions and Products 

Services 

As part of our strategy, we are focusing on being a commercial outsourcing partner to the large defense prime contractors as they seek the more rapid design, development and delivery of affordable, commercially developed, specialized processing solutions within the markets we serve. We deliver subsystem level engineering expertise as well as ongoing systems integration services addressing our strategy to capitalize on the multi-billion dollar subsystem market within the defense embedded electronics market segment. 

As the U.S. government mandates more outsourcing and open standards, a major shift is occurring within the defense prime contractor community towards procurement of integrated subsystems that enable quick application level porting through standards-based methodologies. We believe that our core expertise in this area is well aligned to capitalize on this trend. By leveraging our open architecture and high performance modular product set, we provide defense prime contractors with rapid deployment and quick reaction capabilities through our professional services and systems integration offerings. This results in less risk for the defense prime contractors, shortened development cycles, quicker solution deployment and reduced lifecycle costs. 

We define service revenues as revenue from activities that are not associated with the design, development, production, or delivery of tangible assets, software or specific capabilities sold by us. Examples of our service revenues include: analyst services and systems engineering support, consulting, maintenance and other support, testing and installation. We combine our product and service revenues into a single class as services revenues do not exceed 10 percent of total revenues. 

Software Products 

We actively design, market and sell complete software and middleware environments to accelerate development and execution of complex signal and image processing applications on a broad range of heterogeneous, multi-computing platforms. Our software suite is based on open standards and includes heterogeneous processor support with extensive high performance math libraries, multi-computing fabric support, net-centric and system management enabling services, extended operating system services, board support packages and development tools. 

Our software is developed using some of the most advanced integrated development environments ("IDE&#8217;s"), such as Eclipse, and our work is done on multiple platforms including open source platforms such as Linux. Our software development teams are schooled in the most up-to-date software development methodologies. 

Our software and middleware provides customer application-level algorithm portability across rapidly evolving hardware processor types with math and input/output, or I/O, interfaces running at industry leading performance rates. In order to develop, test and integrate software ahead of hardware availability, we have invested in the notion of a Virtual Multi-Computer. The Virtual Multi-Computer model allows for concurrent engineering internally and with customers to accelerate time to deployment, improve quality and reduce development costs. In most cases, these software products are bundled together with broader solutions including hardware and/or services, while in other cases they are licensed separately. 

Our multi-computer software packages are marketed and licensed under the MultiCore Plus &#174; &#32;registered trademark. These software products are a key differentiator for our systems business and represent only a modest amount of stand-alone revenue. We generally charge a user-based development license fee and bundle software run-time licenses with our hardware. We offer a standards-based software value proposition to our customers and provide this offer through several integrated software packages and service offerings. 

Hardware Products 

We offer a broad family of products designed to meet the full range of requirements in compute-intensive, signal processing and image processing applications, multi-computer interconnect fabrics, sensor interfaces and command and control functions. To maintain a competitive advantage, we seek to leverage technology investments across multiple product lines. We are also influential in the industry-standard organizations associated with our market segments. For example, we started the OpenVPX TM &#32;initiative with the goal of providing customers with multi-vendor interoperable hardware built to well-defined system standards. We continue to leverage our embedded high performance processing technologies with our Intel server-class processing products as well as graphics based processor ("GPGPU") products. While this multi-computing and embedded processing technology is a core skill of Mercury Systems, the size, weight, and power ("SWaP") constraints that occur concurrent with the high performance embedded processing create unique challenges. For example, with the heat build-up involved in small subsystems, we introduced a key innovation in fiscal 2013 designed to address this challenge. The technology is called Air-Flow-By TM &#32;&#32;and it allows previously unattainable levels of processing power within a small footprint by effectively removing heat so the server-class processors can perform at maximum designed power limits. In rugged environments where air is limited, such as high altitude operations, a technology developed in fiscal 2014 called Liquid-Flow-By TM has been successfully customer tested allowing maximum server-class processor performance in high altitude missions. These innovative cooling techniques for the first time allow full performance 

server-class processing in rugged environments enabling new and advanced modes of operation that enhance the multi-intelligence, situational awareness and EW capabilities in military platforms. 

Our hardware products are typically compute-intensive and require extremely high inter-processor bandwidth and high I/O capacity. These systems often must also meet significant size, weight and power constraints for use in aircraft, UAVs, ships and other vehicles, and be ruggedized for use in highly demanding use environments. They are used in both commercial industrial applications, such as ground radar air traffic control, and advanced defense and intelligence applications, including space-time adaptive processing, synthetic aperture radar, airborne early warning, command, control, communication and information systems, mission planning, image intelligence and signal intelligence systems. Our products transform the massive streams of digital data created in these applications into usable information in real time. The systems can scale from a few processors to thousands of processors. 

We group our hardware products into the following categories: 

&#8226; 

signal and image processing, multi-computer and sensor interfaces, including embedded processing boards, switch fabric boards, high speed input/output boards, digital receiver boards, high-density memory modules, secure solid-state drives, secure GPS receiver modules, and chassis-based systems using air, conduction, and proprietary cooling technologies; 

&#8226; 

RF and microwave assemblies, including tuners, converters, transceivers, and switch filters; and 

&#8226; 

RF and microwave components, including power amplifiers and limiters, switches, oscillators, and equalizers. 

To address the current challenges facing the war fighter, our government and defense prime contractors, we have developed a new product architecture that supports a more dynamic, iterative, spiral development process by leveraging open architecture standards and leading-edge commercial technologies and products. Configured and productized as integrated subsystems, customers can rapidly and cost-effectively port and adapt their applications to changing threats. 

Our open architecture is carried throughout our entire Ensemble &#174; &#32;product line from the very small form-factor subsystems to the high-end, where ultimate processing power and reliability is of paramount importance to the mission. Our commercially-developed hardware and software product capabilities cover the entire ISR spectrum from acquisition and digitization of the signal, to processing of the signal, through the exploitation and dissemination of the information. We work continuously to improve our hardware technology with an eye toward optimization of SWaP demands, as outlined above. 

Embedded systems security has become a requirement for new and emerging military programs, and our security solutions are a critical differentiator from our traditional competition. Our security solutions, combined with our next-generation secure Intel server-class product line, together with increasingly frequent mandates from the government to secure electronic systems for domestic and foreign military sales, position us well to capitalize on DoD program protection security requirements. In the defense market, examples of our hardware intellectual property include scalable anti-tamper and information assurance products such as EnforcIT, WhiteboxCRYPTO, and CodeSEAL. In the commercial market, examples of our hardware intellectual property products include our CANGuard product, which provides advanced security for the electronic communications and control architectures on a wide variety of automotive vehicles. 

Research and Product Development 

Our research and development efforts are focused on developing new products and systems as well as enhancing existing hardware and software products in mission, signal and image processing. Our research and development goal is to fully exploit and maintain our technological lead in the high-performance, real-time sensor processing industry. Expenditures for research and development amounted to $33.5 million , $32.6 million , and $35.7 million &#32;in fiscal 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. As of June 30, 2016 , we had 313 employees, including hardware and software architects and design engineers, primarily engaged in engineering and research and product development activities. These individuals, in conjunction with our sales team, also devote a portion of their time to assisting customers in utilizing our products, developing new uses for these products and anticipating customer requirements for new products. 

Manufacturing 

The majority of our sales are produced in International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, 9001:2000 quality system certified facilities. The current scope of delivered hardware products includes commercial and industrial class printed circuit board assemblies (modules), complex chassis systems, and RF &#38; microwave components and subsystems. 

Our Phoenix, Arizona facility manufactures our custom microelectronics products in ISO, 9001:2008 and AS9100 quality system certified facilities. This is a DMEA certified trusted manufacturing facility and is primarily focused on advanced secure system-on-chip design, assembly, packaging, and test. Our Camarillo, California facility manufactures our radio frequency and microwave products in ISO 9001:2008 and AS9100 quality system certified facilities. This facility is primarily focused on millimeter wave RF products up to 100GHz, gallium nitride-based power amplifiers and subsystems, analog and digital mixed signal system-on-chip capabilities, and custom modules for active electronically scanned arrays. 

We rely on both subcontracting to contract manufacturers and vertical integration to meet our manufacturing needs. Our printed circuit board assemblies and chassis systems' manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials planning and procurement, final assembly and test and logistics (inventory and traffic management). We subcontract the assembly and testing of most embedded multi-computing products to contract manufacturers in the U.S. to build to our specifications. We currently rely primarily on one contract manufacturer. Our vertically integrated products rely on strong relationships with strategic suppliers to ensure on-time delivery and high quality products. We manage supplier performance and capability through quality audits and stringent source, incoming and/or first article inspection processes. We have a comprehensive quality and process control plan for each of our products, which include an effective supply chain management program and the use of automated inspection and test equipment to assure the quality and reliability of our products. We perform most post sales service obligations (both warranty and other lifecycle support) in-house through a dedicated service and repair operation. We periodically review our contract manufacturing capabilities to ensure we are optimized for the right mix of quality, affordability, performance and on-time delivery. 

We built out a new microelectronics facility in Hudson, New Hampshire that opened during fiscal 2014. This facility consolidated the former microelectronics operations in Salem, New Hampshire and Hudson, New Hampshire as well as the former facilities in Ewing, New Jersey and Monroe, Connecticut. This facility is specifically aimed at providing scalable manufacturing within our critical RF and microwave businesses. We leverage best practices in design, development, manufacturing and materials handling at this facility. The facility is part of our Advanced Microelectronics Centers, which includes our RF/microwave subsystems group in West Caldwell, New Jersey. The Advanced Microelectronics Centers design, build and test both RF and microwave components and subsystems in support of a variety of key customer programs. 

Although we generally use standard parts and components for our products, certain components, including custom designed ASICs, static random access memory, FPGAs, microprocessors and other third-party chassis peripherals (single board computers, power supplies, blowers, etc.), are currently available only from a single source or from limited sources. With the exception of certain components that have gone &#8220;end of life&#8221;, we strive to maintain minimal supply commitments from our vendors and generally purchase components on a purchase order basis as opposed to entering into long-term procurement agreements with vendors. We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of components in a timely manner from current vendors or, when necessary to meet production needs, from alternate vendors. We believe that, in most cases, alternate vendors can be identified if current vendors are unable to fulfill needs. 

We also design, develop, and manufacture DRFM units for a variety of modern EW applications, as well as radar environment simulation and test systems for defense and intelligence applications. We develop high performance SIGINT payloads and electro-optical/infrared ("EO/IR") technologies for small UAV platforms as well as powerful onboard UAV processor systems for real-time Wide Area Motion Imagery ("WAMI"). 

Competition 

We operate in a highly competitive marketplace characterized by rapidly changing technology, frequent product performance improvements, increasing speed of deployment to align with warfighters&#8217; needs, and evolving industry standards and requirements coming from our customers or the DoD. Competition typically occurs at the design stage of a prospective customer&#8217;s product, where the customer evaluates alternative technologies and design approaches. We work with defense prime contractors as well as directly with the DoD. We help drive subsystem development and deployment in both classified and unclassified environments. 

The principal competitive factors in our market are price/performance value proposition, available new products at the time of design win engagement, services and systems integration capability, effective marketing and sales efforts, and reputation in the market. Our competitive strengths include innovative engineering in both hardware and software products, subsystem design expertise, advanced packaging capability to deliver the most optimized SWaP solution possible, our ability to rapidly respond to varied customer requirements, and a track record of successfully supporting many high profile programs in the defense market. There are a limited number of competitors across the market segments and application types in which we compete. Some of these competitors are larger and have greater resources than us. Some of these competitors compete against us at purely a board-level, others at a subsystem level. We also compete with in-house design teams at our customers. The DoD as well as the defense prime contractors are pushing for more outsourcing of subsystem designs to mitigate risk and to enable concurrent design of the platform which ultimately leads to faster time to deployment. We have aligned our strategy to capitalize on that trend and are leveraging our long standing subsystem expertise to provide this value to our customers. 

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 

As of June 30, 2016 , we held 67 patents of varying duration issued in the United States. We file U.S. patent applications and, where appropriate, foreign patent applications. We also file continuations to cover both new and improved designs and products. At present, we have several U.S. and foreign patent applications in process. 

We also rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, as well as contractual agreements, to safeguard our proprietary rights in technology and products. In seeking to limit access to sensitive information to the greatest practical extent, 

we routinely enter into confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements with each of our employees and consultants and nondisclosure agreements with our key customers and vendors. 

Backlog 

As of June 30, 2016 , we had a backlog of orders aggregating approximately $287.7 million, of which $239.2 million is expected to be delivered within the next twelve months. The backlog as of June 30, 2016 included $62.9 million from the Carve-Out Business. As of June 30, 2015 , backlog was approximately $208.0 million. We include in our backlog customer orders for products and services for which we have accepted signed purchase orders, as long as that order is scheduled to ship or invoice in whole, or in part, within the next 24 months. Orders included in backlog may be canceled or rescheduled by customers, although the customer may incur cancellation penalties depending on the timing of the cancellation. A variety of conditions, both specific to the individual customer and generally affecting the customer&#8217;s industry, may cause customers to cancel, reduce or delay orders that were previously made or anticipated. We cannot assure the timely replacement of canceled, delayed or reduced orders. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions or delays in orders by a customer or group of customers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or our ability to predict future revenues. Backlog should not be relied upon as indicative of our revenues for any future period. 

Employees 

At June 30, 2016 , we employed a total of 965 &#32;people excluding contractors, including 313 in research and development, 77 in sales and marketing, 438 in manufacturing and customer support and 137 in general and administrative functions. We have five employees located in Europe, one located in Japan, and 959 located in the United States. We do not have any employees represented by a labor organization, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good. 

Customers 

Our revenues are concentrated in three defense prime contractors including Lockheed Martin Corporation, Raytheon Company and Northrop Grumman Corporation for the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 . These three defense prime contractors comprised an aggregate of 51% , 61% &#32;and 43% &#32;of our revenues in each of the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. While sales to these customers typically compose 10% or more of our revenue, the sales to each of these customers are spread across multiple programs and platforms.
