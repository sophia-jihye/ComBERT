 ITEM 1.BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Our Company 

&#160; 

We are a world-renowned innovator, designer, manufacturer, and marketer of premium performance sport boats, with a leading market position in the U.S., a strong international presence, and dealers in 40 countries around the world. Our boats are used for water skiing, wakeboarding, and wake surfing, as well as general recreational boating. We believe that MasterCraft is the most recognized brand name in the performance sport boat category. Founded in 1968, we have cultivated our iconic brand image through a rich history of industry-leading innovation, which has led to numerous industry achievements, awards, and accolades. Our robust product portfolio of performance sport boats is manufactured to the highest specifications in quality, performance, and styling. 

&#160; 

We are committed to delivering an extraordinary boating experience to our customers. From pioneering innovations that improve enjoyment on the water to offering products that promote rapid development of skills, our mission is to help our customers generate memories that will last a lifetime. We utilize a comprehensive product development process in order to build the most relevant and exciting products for our customers, year after year. We believe that our commitment to quality is unsurpassed in the performance sport boat category, and we engage in operational excellence to deploy flexible and effective production systems that ensure we design and build the highest quality boats in the market. 

&#160; 

All of our boats, from hull to upholstery, are hand-crafted by our skilled workforce at our corporate headquarters near Knoxville, Tennessee. We use only the highest quality materials from industry-preferred suppliers and all of our boats are extensively tested on the water at our state-of-the-art facility prior to sale. In recent years, we have made significant investments in improving design, engineering, manufacturing, and operational processes as we strive to be the most efficient performance sport boat manufacturer in the industry. We are the only boat manufacturer to achieve compliance with all three of the International Standard for Organization (&#8220;ISO&#8221;) 9001 (Quality Management Systems), 14001 (Environmental Management Systems), and 18001 (International Occupational Health and Safety Management System) standards. Our industry-leading operations result in world-class quality, which enables us to offer a best-in-class five-year factory warranty and results in MasterCraft boats typically maintaining higher aftermarket resale value than our competitors&#8217; boats. 

&#160; 

We sell our boats through an extensive network of independent dealers in North America and internationally. Our boats are the exclusive performance sport boats offered by the majority of our dealers. We devote significant time and resources to find, develop, and improve the performance of our dealers. We continuously cultivate and strengthen our dealer relationships with marketing, training, and service programs designed to increase our dealers&#8217; sales and profitability. We believe the strength of our dealer network and our proactive efforts to help our dealers improve their businesses give us a distinct competitive advantage in our industry. 

&#160; 

Our History 

&#160; 

MasterCraft was founded in 1968 when we built our first custom hull ski boat in a two-stall horse barn on a farm in Maryville, Tennessee. Dissatisfied with the large wakes and pull of other ski boats, we designed a hull that had the smallest wake in the industry: smooth and low at slalom and jump speeds yet well-defined at trick speeds. Our roots in performance water ski boats were reinforced as we evolved over the next 40 years to produce leading performance-oriented boats in the wakeboarding and wake surfing categories. Today, we continue to produce the industry&#8217;s premier competitive water ski, wakeboarding, and wake surfing performance boats that also address our customers&#8217; needs for versatility, flexibility, fun, and functionality. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

During 2015, retail sales of new powerboats in the U.S. totaled $7.8 billion. Of the categories defined and tracked by the National Marine Manufacturers Association (&#8220;NMMA&#8221;) our core market corresponds most directly to the inboard ski/wakeboard category, which we refer to as the performance sport boat category. We believe our addressable market also includes similar and adjacent powerboat categories identified by the NMMA, including sterndrive boats, outboard boats, and jet boats. For 2015, retail sales of new performance sport boats, sterndrive boats, outboard boats, and jet boats in the U.S. were $686 million, $924 million, $3,828 million, and $208 million, respectively. As a result, we believe the total annual addressable market for our products in the U.S. alone is greater than $5.6 billion. 

&#160; 

We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from several trends underway in our addressable market, including: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

performance sport boats are taking greater share of the overall fiberglass powerboat category; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

dealer inventory positions have improved across the industry; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

recreational boating participation in the U.S. reached 87.3 million adults in 2014, a 32.5% increase since 2009; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

inventory of two to five year old pre-owned boats has become limited, driving consumers to purchase new boats; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

ease-of-use and performance innovations have accelerated product cycles driving consumer demand for new products; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

higher consumer confidence influenced by improving macroeconomic conditions, including increased home values and greater workforce participation, has helped to drive increased consumer demand for powerboats. 

&#160; 

As the recovery in the general economy and overall boating industry from the economic downturn that commenced in 2008 has continued, the performance sport boat category has experienced a robust recovery. According to Statistical Surveys, Inc. (&#8220;SSI&#8221;), new unit sales of performance sport boats in the U.S. increased at a compound annual growth rate (&#8220;CAGR&#8221;) of 12.6% from 2012 to 2015 while new unit sales of all fiberglass power boats increased at a CAGR of 2.4% in the U.S. over the same period. We believe the performance sport boat category has grown at a faster rate due to increased innovation in the features, designs, and layouts of performance sport boats. These innovations have improved the performance, functionality, and versatility of these boats as compared with other recreational powerboats, particularly boats in the sterndrive category, which have not experienced the same degree of innovation. We believe inboard boats are superior to sterndrive boats for tow sports such as water skiing, wakeboarding, and wake surfing for several reasons, including (i) the larger and more propulsive wakes that only inboard engine configurations can enable, (ii) enhanced rider safety as a result of the location of the inboard propeller underneath the boat instead of protruding from the stern, as is generally the case with boats in the sterndrive category, and (iii) relatively more passenger and storage space due to the location of the inboard engine housing. 

&#160; 

Performance sport boats have also continued to take share from other powerboat categories, in particular the sterndrive category, with new performance sport boat unit sales volume steadily increasing from 2002 through 2015 as a percentage of the total combined new unit sales volume of performance sport and sterndrive boats. We believe our strong market share position and broad offering of boat models and features will continue to attract customers from other powerboat categories to our performance sport boats. While the performance sport boat category has grown in recent years, new unit sales remained significantly below historical peaks. According to NMMA, the 7,800 new performance sport boat units sold in 2015 were 40.2% below the observed peak in 2006. 

&#160; 

The expanding popularity of boating has also contributed to the strong recovery in volumes. According to NMMA, 87.3 million adults participated in recreational boating in 2014, a 32.5% increase since 2009. We believe we are well- 

&#160;

positioned to benefit from the increased popularity of recreational boating and the resulting larger prospective customer base. 

&#160; 

Our Strengths 

&#160; 

Iconic Brand Synonymous with Quality, Innovation, and Performance. We believe the MasterCraft brand is well-known among boating enthusiasts for high performance, premier quality, and relentless innovation. We believe that the market recognizes MasterCraft as a premier and aspirational brand in the performance sport boat category due to the overall superior value proposition that our boats deliver to our customers. 

&#160; 

The MasterCraft brand is built on a carefully crafted set of defining principles: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Legacy: Our heritage of successful product innovations has contributed to our status as one of the most widely recognized and aspirational brands in the boating industry. We work tirelessly every day to maintain our iconic brand reputation relative to our competition. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Power: MasterCraft boats are renowned for their superior performance. For example, our flagship water ski boat, the ProStar, which was introduced in 2013, is widely recognized as the premier three-event ski boat in the industry and has been responsible for driving a number of world record ski and ski jumping performances since its launch, including the Men&#8217;s World Jump Record of 312 feet and new records in over 50 events at the 2014 World 35+ Water Ski Championships, as well as numerous personal records for amateur skiers around the world. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Precision: The rigorous attention to detail with which we design and manufacture our products results in high quality boats that command significant resale premiums to comparable competitor boats. The high quality and durability of our products allow us to offer a &#8220;stem-to-stern&#8221; five-year warranty that comprehensively covers more parts of our boats than warranties offered by any of our competitors. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Progression: Our brand is known to represent innovation and achievement. For example, only MasterCraft boats offer a longer, more powerful &#8220;Zone 4&#8221; surfing wake, which was introduced on the MasterCraft X23, the winner of the 2015 NMMA Innovation Award. &#8220;Zone 4&#8221; wakes are measured as 15 to 20 feet from the swim platform of the boat and provide more traversable wave surface area and the ability to surf bigger boards. We have pioneered multiple technological innovations in the industry, many of which have advanced the performance standards of our industry and have garnered innovation awards from organizations such as the NMMA and Boating Writers International. 

&#160; 

Leading Market Share Position in Performance Sport Boat Category. Over the last decade, we have consistently held a leading market share position in the U.S. among manufacturers of premium performance sport boats based on unit volume. According to SSI our U.S. market share in 2015 was 21.7%. We believe our sales have grown as dealers and customers continue to recognize the superior quality, performance, styling, and value of our recently released boats and that we are just starting to realize the market share benefits of the many recent new product offerings and product enhancement initiatives that our management team has implemented during the past several years. For example, our MasterCraft NXT line of entry-level boats will further increase our market share as it represents our first offering in this market segment, which accounts for approximately one-third of the performance sport boat category. 

&#160; 

Industry-Leading Product Design and Innovation. We believe that our innovation in the design of new boat models and new features has been a key to our success, helping us maintain our market share, command higher price points, and generally broaden the appeal of our products among recreational boaters. As a result of the features we have introduced, we believe that our boats are used for an increasingly wide range of activities. Our commitment to consistently developing 

&#160;

new boat models and introducing new features is reflected in several notable recent achievements, including NMMA Innovation Awards for our ProStar water skiing boat, Gen 2 integrated surf system and X23 performance tow boat. These MasterCraft products won three of the combined six Innovation Awards for the performance sport boat category presented by the NMMA at the 2014 and 2015 Miami Boat Shows. Recently we launched the new Dockstar Handling System which is an innovative flanking rudder system that allows drivers to easily maneuver tight spaces and crowded marinas in reverse. Our entire product portfolio has been renewed in the past five years, giving us the newest overall product offering in the performance sport boat category, which we believe positions us for strong growth in the coming periods. 

&#160; 

Highly Efficient Product Development and Manufacturing. A key to our success has been our renewed focus on operational improvements and world-class business processes. We believe our new product development capabilities are industry-leading and enable us to consistently create unique high performance hull shapes and product features in shorter design iterations and at lower development costs than our competitors. These capabilities enable us to precisely design custom hulls and performance features that enhance each boat&#8217;s unique performance characteristics and increase our speed to market with exciting new products. 

&#160; 

We have also made recent significant investments in infrastructure, value-added processes, and engineering. These investments have resulted in lower material waste, reduced labor hours per boat, reduced re-work, and increased production efficiencies. We were named a 2015 IndustryWeek Best Plant in North America Recipient&#8212;the only boat manufacturer to receive that honor. In addition, our manufacturing quality performance has allowed us to reduce our warranty costs even while offering an industry-leading five-year &#8220;stem-to-stern&#8221; warranty. We believe that our scalability and operational efficiency has allowed us to limit our annual Company-wide weighted average boat price increase to less than 3% annually from model year 2013 to model year 2016, enabling us to narrow the pricing gap between us and our competitors. We are able to narrow this pricing gap while increasing margins by controlling costs through our highly disciplined engineering and manufacturing processes. 

&#160; 

Strong Dealer Network. We have worked extensively with our dealers to develop what we believe is the strongest dealer network in the performance sport boat category. Our extensive dealer network allows us to distribute our products more effectively than our competitors. We target our distribution on the category&#8217;s highest performing dealers, with more of our dealers placing in Boating Industry magazine&#8217;s Top 20 Dealers than any of our competitors in the performance sport boat category. We have established operating processes focused on optimizing dealers&#8217; financial performance and service, and with a track record of balancing wholesale inventory and retail sales we are better able to manage dealer inventory, allowing for more transparent sales estimates and strong dealer relationships. In addition, we have established a &#8220;stem-to-stern&#8221; five-year warranty for all of our product lines. We believe our warranty is simpler and more transparent than those of our competitors, and provide consumers with more peace of mind. This industry-leading warranty encourages customers to continue to visit our dealers for servicing, creating additional opportunities for boat trade-ins and purchases of accessories, thereby improving our dealers&#8217; sales rates and financial health. These actions have strengthened our existing dealer network and are driving increased interest from new potential dealers who want to join the MasterCraft platform. 

&#160; 

Differentiated Sales and Marketing Capabilities. We believe our marketing efforts support the MasterCraft brand promise by focusing on the superior MasterCraft value proposition and differentiating the performance and features of our boats. To highlight our performance credibility and generate additional brand excitement, we sponsor the #1, #2, #3, and #5 ranked professional wakeboarding athletes, the #2 ranked water ski jumper, and the #3 ranked male and #3 ranked female water skiers, who all trust the performance of our boats to enhance their careers. In addition, we partner with Surfing Magazine and musician and avid surfer Donavon Frankenreiter to promote our boats&#8217; wake surfing capabilities and our brand lifestyle. We also partner with other innovative athletes and brands, such as Travis Pastrana, GoPro, Nixon, Hobie, ESPN, and Sanuk, all offering compelling co-marketing opportunities to expand our brand&#8217;s lifestyle positioning. We believe our superior sales and marketing capabilities effectively communicate our performance, styling, quality, authenticity, and lifestyle, resulting in increased overall customer engagement. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Highly Experienced Management Team. We have a highly seasoned and effective management team. With an average of more than 25 years of boating industry experience per member, our management team has proven its ability to develop and integrate new product lines, enhance operations, strengthen our distribution network, and recruit industry talent. Senior management additions over the past few years have driven improvements to our manufacturing, quality, and product development systems and processes, which have collectively accelerated performance improvements as unit volumes have increased. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Terry McNew, has 29 years of boating industry experience. He joined MasterCraft in August 2012 after serving as Executive Vice President of Brunswick Corp&#8217;s recreational boat group, where he was in charge of manufacturing, product development, and engineering and quality systems. His leadership has helped us implement dramatic process improvements contributing to superior results. Tim Oxley, our Chief Financial Officer, has spent 26 years in the boating industry, including ten years with MasterCraft, following 16 years with Brunswick Corp. where he served as Chief Financial Officer of several operating divisions. Our management team has produced superior results compared to our competitors, including sales growth, award-winning product innovation, and significant margin expansion. 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

We intend to capitalize on the ongoing recovery in the broader boating industry and performance sport boat category through the following strategies: 

&#160; 

Continue to Develop New and Innovative Products in Our Core Market. As a leading innovator, designer, manufacturer, and marketer of premium performance sport boats, we strive to design new and inventive products that appeal to a broad customer base. Since the completion of our management changes in fiscal 2013, we have successfully launched a number of new products and features with best-in-class quality leading to increased sales and significant margin expansion. Furthermore, our unique new product development process enables us to renew our product portfolio with innovative offerings at a rate that we believe will be difficult for our competitors to match without significant additional capital investments. Our process involves each department in collaborative full &#8220;team&#8221; product launches that enable us to release three new models per year while maintaining superior quality and controlling costs. Our entire product portfolio has been renewed in the past five years. We intend to continue releasing new products and features multiple times during the year, which we believe enhances our reputation as a cutting-edge boat manufacturer and will drive consumer interest in our products. 

&#160; 

Penetrate the Entry-Level and Mid-Line Segments of the Performance Sport Boat Category. Our near-term product development strategy is to expand our product line to reach underserved segments of the performance sport boat category that are distinct from our traditional customer base. We believe the launch of our MasterCraft NXT product line in fiscal 2014 has made the MasterCraft brand more accessible to a much broader demographic of the recreational boating industry and will continue to do so in the future. The MasterCraft NXT product line allows us to penetrate the entry-level segment of our market, which has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 26.6% over the last four years, with 2,872 total boats sold across the segment in 2015. With the NXT product line, we are targeting a new market segment for MasterCraft with a product that offers the highest levels of quality, style, reliability, functionality, and performance expected from our MasterCraft brand. This strategy contrasts with that of a number of our competitors, which have targeted this market segment with alternative value brands. The unique design of the MasterCraft NXT, along with our existing supplier relationships, material agreements, and manufacturing processes, allows us to offer this product at an attractive price point for the consumer while sustaining our gross margins and the product attributes critical to the MasterCraft brand. Further broadening our consumer base, we recently launched the new XT23, MasterCraft&#8217;s latest multi-sport model. Designed to be a do-it-all crossover, the new XT23 will anchor our new XT line of boats targeting the sweet spot between our entry-level NXT line and the award-winning, premium X series. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Capture Additional Share from Adjacent Boating Categories. Our culture of innovation enhances our ability to introduce new products with increased versatility, functionality, and performance to a more expansive customer base that values boats for both water sports and general recreational boating purposes. We have experienced success with several recent marketing campaigns that focus on new product launches and help to educate the market on our value proposition to customers. Ultimately, the versatile boating experience delivered by our performance sport boats allows us to attract customers from other boating categories, most notably from the sterndrive category. For example, the MasterCraft X26, one of our 26 foot boat models, has the capacity to seat 18 people and offers the quality, performance, and styling associated with our iconic brand in a package that can compete with large day cruisers in the sterndrive category. 

&#160; 

We intend to further enhance the performance, comfort, and versatility of our products in order to target additional crossover customers seeking high performance powerboats for general recreational activity. We believe that several of our recently launched and planned new products will appeal to a broader range of recreational boaters by offering the performance benefits of our products, including superior drivability and water sports versatility, while also providing greater seating capacity and comfort, a roomy, plush interior and extensive storage space to allow an increased number of family and friends to spend time together on the water. 

&#160; 

Continuous Operational Improvement to Drive Margin Expansion. We continue to implement a number of initiatives to reduce our cost base and to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing process. We revamped our manufacturing and product development processes, which led to operational efficiencies that have driven significant margin expansion despite lower average boat sale price increases than our competitors. These process improvements have lowered re-work, warranty claims, material waste, and inventory levels, significantly reducing our costs, and have driven improved on-time delivery rates. Additionally, we have fostered a culture of operational improvement within our highly engaged workforce. We have also implemented a faster and more disciplined product development process, which will allow us to completely renew our product portfolio every four years. These processes are now ingrained in the culture at MasterCraft, leading to a Company-wide focus on driving further margin expansion through continuous improvement. We believe these important process improvements and culture of operational excellence provide us with a strong operational foundation for future growth. 

&#160; 

Effectively Manage Dealer Inventory and Further Strengthen Our Dealer Network. Our goal is to achieve and maintain a leading market share in each of the markets in which we operate. We view our dealers as our partners and product champions. Therefore, we devote significant time and resources to finding high quality dealers, and developing and improving their performance over time. We actively manage dealer inventory levels, as demonstrated by healthy and consistent inventory retail turns and balanced wholesale and retail unit sales, which leads to better margins and improved financial health for our dealers. Additionally, our unique &#8220;stem-to-stern&#8221; warranty and predictable new product development cycle ensure that our dealers have high quality, compelling, and relevant products to sell to their customers. We believe the quality and trust in our dealer relationships are more beneficial to our long-term success than the quantity of dealers. We continue to leverage that dealer base while proactively developing strategies that will strengthen our overall network. For example, we intend to strengthen our current footprint by selectively recruiting market-leading dealers. We believe our targeted initiatives to enhance and grow our dealer network will increase unit sales in the future. 

&#160; 

Increase Our Sales in International Markets. We currently have an extensive international distribution network with 43 international dealers in 56 locations around the world. We believe we have the most well-known brand in the performance sport boat category globally. Based on our brand recognition, innovative product offerings, and distribution strengths, we believe we are well positioned to leverage our reputation and capture additional international sales. We believe that we will increase our international sales by promoting our new products in developed markets where we have a well-established dealer base and in international markets where rising consumer incomes are expected to increase demand for recreational products, such as Australia, Europe, Israel, Dubai, and Brazil. We are also developing new product offerings that will 

&#160;

specifically target certain product demand from our international consumers and that we believe will drive further sales growth in international markets. Net sales outside of North America represented 8.6% of net sales volume in fiscal 2016. 

&#160; 

Our Products 

&#160; 

We design, manufacture, and sell premium recreational performance sport boats that we believe deliver superior performance for water skiing, wakeboarding, and wake surfing, as well as general recreational boating. In addition, we offer various accessories, including trailers and aftermarket parts. 

&#160; 

Our MasterCraft-branded portfolio of Star Series, XSeries, XTSeries and NXT boats are designed for the highest levels of performance, styling, and enjoyment for both recreational and competitive use. The Star Series and XSeries are geared towards the consumer seeking the most premium and highest performance boating experience that we offer, and generally command a price premium over our competitors&#8217; boats at retail prices ranging from approximately $60,000 to $150,000. The MasterCraft XT line was introduced in July 2016 as a multi-sport, category-defying crossover, with retail prices ranging from approximately $100,000 to $125,000. Unveiled in January 2014, the MasterCraft NXT line introduced the quality, performance, styling, and innovation of the MasterCraft brand to the entry-level consumer, with retail prices ranging from approximately $50,000 to $75,000. We have strategically designed and priced the MasterCraft NXT line to target the fast-growing entry-level customer group that is distinct from our traditional customer base, while maintaining our core MasterCraft brand attributes at profit margins comparable to our other offerings. 

&#160; 

Over the past 40 years, we have been a leading and consistent innovator in the boating industry, beginning in 1968 with our first custom hull ski boat. We have been the first to market with numerous innovations, including the first swim platform in 1976, the patented wearguard ski pylon in 1989, a V-drive drivetrain and a dedicated wakeboard-specific boat in 1996, a now popular pickle-fork style bow in 2003, a twin V-drive engine in 2004, wake and surf shaping devices in 2009, our patented Gen 2 fully integrated surf system in 2013, and the recently launched Dockstar Handling System. Each of these pioneering introductions has allowed our customers to more fully enjoy the ultimate water skiing, wakeboarding, wake surfing, and on-the-water recreational experience that our boats provide. Throughout our history, our boats have received numerous industry awards for product innovations, including recent NMMA Innovation Awards for our ProStar water skiing boat, Gen 2 integrated surf system and X23 performance tow boat. These MasterCraft products won three of the combined six Innovation Awards for the performance sport boat category presented by the NMMA at the 2014 and 2015 Miami Boat Shows. &#160; Recently we launched the new Dockstar Handling System which is an innovative flanking rudder system that allows drivers to easily maneuver tight spaces and crowded marinas in reverse. The revolutionary new technology essentially removes the last entry barrier into the inboard market for owners who previously preferred the handling of an outboard or stern drive configuration when driving in reverse. We believe our innovative features are important factors in our end consumer&#8217;s purchasing decision and the availability and desirability of these features increase our sales and market share. 

&#160; 

Our Dealer Network 

&#160; 

We rely on an extensive network of independent dealers to sell our products in North America and internationally. We target our distribution on the market segment&#8217;s highest performing dealers, with more of our dealers placing in Boating Industry magazine&#8217;s Top 20 Dealers than any of our competitors in the performance sport boat category. The majority of our dealers are exclusive to our MasterCraft product lines within the performance sport boat category, highlighting the commitment of our key dealers to MasterCraft boats. We establish performance criteria that our dealers must meet as part of their dealer agreements to ensure the continued quality of our dealer network. As members of our network, dealers in North America may qualify for floor plan financing programs, rebates, seasonal discounts, promotional co-op payments, and other allowances. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We consistently review our distribution network to identify opportunities to expand our geographic footprint and improve our coverage of the market. We constantly monitor the health and strength of our dealers by analyzing each dealer&#8217;s retail sales and inventory frequently, and have established processes to identify underperforming dealers in order to assist them in improving their performance or to allow us to switch to a more effective dealer. These processes also allow us to better manage dealer inventory levels and product turns and contribute to a healthier dealer network that is better able to stock and sell our products. We believe our outstanding dealer network and our proactive approach to dealer management allow us to distribute our products more efficiently than our competitors and will help us capitalize on growth opportunities as our industry volumes continue to increase. 

&#160; 

North America. In North America, we had a total of 90 dealers across 141 locations as of June 30, 2016. There were no locations where MasterCraft was replaced by competitive products during fiscal 2016. We do not have a significant concentration of sales among our dealers. For fiscal 2016, our top ten dealers accounted for approximately 40% of our gross sales and none of our dealers accounted for more than 6.5% of our total sales volume. 

&#160; 

Outside of North America. As of June 30, 2016, we had a total of 43 international dealers in 56 locations. We are present in Europe, Australia, Asia, including Hong Kong and the Middle East. Last year we added independent dealers in Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Qatar. We generated 8.6%, 9.9% and 14.7% of our unit sales outside of North America in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

Dealer Management 

&#160; 

We have developed a system of financial incentives for our dealers based on achievement of key benchmarks. In addition, we provide our dealers with comprehensive sales training and a complete set of technology-based tools designed to help dealers maximize performance. Our dealer incentive program has been refined through over 45 years of experience with some of the key elements including performance incentives, discounts paid for achieving volume and purchase scheduling targets, and cash discounts during the first six months of the model year to encourage balanced demand throughout the year. In addition, we pay incentives for attending our annual dealer meeting, a three-day event featuring a robust program of dealer training seminars that focus on areas such as sales growth, inventory management, and retail strategy, in addition to product-oriented information. This incentive payment is based on participation by all salespeople from a dealership, not solely the principals. 

&#160; 

Beyond our incentive programs, we have developed a proprietary web- based management tool that is used by our dealers on a day-to-day basis to improve their own businesses as well as enhance communication with our factory and sales management teams. Our proprietary DealerLink online business-to-business application efficiently executes many critical functions, including warranty registrations, warranty claims, boat ordering and tracking, parts ordering, technical support, and inventory reporting. This system facilitates communication between our sales team and the dealer network and allows our manufacturing department to review customer demand in real time. 

&#160; 

Our relationship with our dealers is governed by dealer agreements. Each dealer agreement typically has a finite term lasting between one and three years. Our dealer agreements are typically terminable without cause by the dealer at any time and by us with 90 days&#8217; prior notice. We may also generally terminate these agreements immediately for cause upon certain events. Pursuant to our dealer agreements, the dealers typically agree to, among other things (i) represent our products at specified boat shows; (ii) market our products only to retail end users in a specific geographic territory; (iii) promote and demonstrate our products to consumers; (iv) place a specified minimum number of orders of our products during the term of the agreement in exchange for rebate eligibility that varies according to the level of volume they commit to purchase; (v) provide us with regular updates regarding the number and type of our products in their inventory; (vi) maintain a service department to service our products and perform all appropriate warranty service and repairs; and (vii) indemnify us for certain claims. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our dealer network, including all additions, renewals, non-renewals, or terminations, is managed by our sales personnel. Our sales team operates using a semi-annual dealer review process involving our senior management team. Each individual dealer is reviewed semi-annually with a broad assessment across multiple key elements, including the dealer&#8217;s geographic region, market share, and customer service ratings, to identify underperforming dealers for remediation and to manage the transition process when non-renewal or termination is a necessary step. 

&#160; 

Sales Cycles and Floor Plan Financing 

&#160; 

We manage our annual sales plan through distinct buying periods. Our rebates are tiered so that dealers have a financial incentive to take the stocking risk for boats purchased prior to the traditional retail selling season (April - June). These incentives, accompanied by floor plan subsidies for up to nine months from the date of invoice, drive &#8220;level loading&#8221; of production. During this first part of the model year, many of the dealers&#8217; orders are standard configurations for their showrooms. In the second part of the model year, more boats are customized by retail customers. Many of these custom orders are placed during boat shows, which occur from January through early April across North America. 

&#160; 

We offer our dealers the opportunity to purchase boats with cash or through floor plan financing programs with third-party floor plan financing providers. We encourage our dealers to purchase in cash by offering them a cash discount. The floor plan financing programs allow dealers to establish lines of credit with third-party lenders to purchase inventory. Upon purchase of a boat, dealers draw on the floor plan facility and the lenders pay the invoice price of the boat directly to us within 10 business days. Collection is guaranteed through an assigned approval number or cash receipt prior to shipment of the boat. Consistent with industry practice, we offer various manufacturer-sponsored floor plan interest programs under which we agree to reimburse our dealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred for up to nine months from the date of invoice. Cash discounts are offered as an alternative to floor plan subsidies during the &#8220;off-season&#8221; for retail sales (July - March). These programs encourage dealers to rapidly replenish inventories during the spring and summer retail season, maintain sufficient inventories during the non-peak season, and balance wholesale purchases throughout the year. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the terms of the floor plan financing, if a dealer defaults on the terms of its credit line, we agree to repurchase new inventory repossessed from dealerships for a period of up to 30 months from the date of the original sale of the products. Under most circumstances, the repurchase obligation is for any amount outstanding up to 100% of the invoice amount for the first 12 months after sale, 90% of the invoice amount for the next 12 months after sale, and 80% of the invoice amount for the final six months of our repurchase commitment period. Our obligation to repurchase such repossessed products for the unpaid balance of our original invoice price for the boat is subject to reduction or limitation based on the age and condition of the boat at the time of repurchase, and in certain cases, by an aggregate cap on repurchase obligations associated with a particular floor plan financing program. 

&#160; 

We have only incurred a single loss on a finance company mandated repurchase agreement since fiscal 2010 totaling approximately $75,000. The repurchased inventory has historically been resold to other dealers at approximately 80% to 90% of original wholesale prices, thereby avoiding significant losses. During fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, we repurchased 9 units under the repurchase obligation agreement with GE Australia and all of the boats repurchased were re-sold. There were no boats repurchased during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Sales 

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

Our 45-year history of manufacturing and design leadership has made MasterCraft one of the most well-known and iconic brands in the boating industry. We believe the MasterCraft brand is widely recognized even among non- enthusiasts. We 

&#160;

are focused on enhancing the power of our brand through a multifaceted marketing strategy. Our addressable market is targeted through a variety of specialized means, ranging from grass-roots event sponsorships to far-reaching strategic alliances. 

&#160; 

We have created a unified print and digital advertising strategy that is refreshed each year, featuring the unique attributes of each of our products while maintaining focus on the MasterCraft brand. We maintain a meaningful presence for our Star Series and XSeries product lines in several endemic water sports publications, including Wakeboarding, WaterSki, SBC Wakeboard, Alliance Wakeboard Magazine, and USA WaterSkier. Given the prevalence of our products in the markets these publications target, we also benefit from significant unpaid impressions in these industry publications, as our boats frequently appear in feature stories and advertisements for other products. In addition to these traditional marketing channels, in the last several years we have created an active and highly successful digital advertising and social media platform, including the use of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Vimeo to deliver content to our target audience, increase awareness of our brand, foster loyalty, and build a community of MasterCraft enthusiasts. In addition, we benefit from numerous user-generated videos and photos that are uploaded to these websites. The execution of our digital strategy has been highly successful, driving double the engagement on Facebook, the highest number of Instagram followers and engagement, and the highest ranked YouTube channel compared to any of our competitors. An important component of this strategy has been our investment in our own mastercraft.com website. The site is designed to allow significant interaction between us and our customer base through marketing content delivery, message boards, news and event postings, and product updates and specifications. In addition, mastercraft.com&#8217;s popular &#8220;Design-a-Boat&#8221; functionality allows consumers to design a boat and request a dealer quote. The custom-designed product can be transmitted directly to our closest independent dealer as well as our in-house concierge who follows up directly with our dealer leads on behalf of MasterCraft. 

&#160; 

We are focused on generating relevant and compelling content for our network of customers and enthusiasts in order to drive industry-leading engagement with our target consumer, and our capabilities in this regard have been well recognized both inside and outside our industry. We also selectively partner with leading franchises from other industries that have similar brand attributes and demographic characteristics. The goal of this non-endemic strategy is to create a wider, actionable audience by teaming up with other appropriate brands to get access to their existing market. Our non-endemic partnerships with highly recognizable brands such as GoPro, Nixon, Hobie, ESPN, and Sanuk have allowed us to increase our audience during product launches and events, ultimately generating actionable sale leads for our dealers. In addition, we partnered with musician and pro surfer Donavon Frankenreiter along with Sanuk and Grind-Media for the launch of the all-new X23, in order to communicate that boat&#8217;s superior wake surfing performance and to reinforce the lifestyle attributes of our MasterCraft brand. These initiatives not only connect our brand with these valuable and highly recognizable partners, but more importantly they lead to engagement with our end consumers and ultimately to sales leads for our dealers. We believe that our associations with leading franchises and brands such as these reinforce the aspirational, high-performance attributes of our brand, allow us to reach a very large population of affluent, action-oriented consumers as well as new customers for our new products, and allow us to reinforce and expand our MasterCraft brand&#8217;s lifestyle positioning. 

&#160; 

Our leading position in the performance sport boat category is further supported by our sponsorship of some of the most recognizable and successful athletes in water sports, as well as a number of highly visible competitions and events around the world. Our activities in this area serve to deepen the penetration of our brand within the professional and enthusiast community, while also supporting the growth of the sports. The events which we sponsor and in which we and our dealers participate feature the most popular figures in wakeboarding and water skiing, drawing large audiences of enthusiasts to a variety of sites around the country. Furthermore, we sponsor the top ranked professional wakeboarding athletes, water ski jumpers, and water skiers. In addition to the advertising generated by the athletes&#8217; success in their sports, we also leverage our sponsorship of these athletes by having them attend boat shows and dealer events and appear in creative media events, 

&#160;

in which they garner public relations interest, build our MasterCraft brand, and in many cases help sell our products directly to consumers. 

&#160; 

We believe that our differentiated marketing capabilities and our multi-channel, content-driven marketing strategies align with our strategic focus on product innovation, performance, and quality to attract aspiring and enthusiast consumers to our brands and products. These sales and marketing efforts allow us to more effectively launch and support our products, help drive actionable sales leads for our dealers, and reinforce our MasterCraft brand and lifestyle attributes. 

&#160; 

Sales 

&#160; 

Our sales effort is led by Mr. Jay Povlin, our Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing, who joined us in 2013. The North American sales organization includes a national sales manager, four business development managers, and two inside sales managers. Most of our domestic sales team has been with us for at least ten years. Our sales team is further supported by an international sales manager and three independent sales representatives. 

&#160; 

Our sales organization&#8217;s primary role is to manage our network of existing dealers and work with them to increase sales of our products, as well as identifying and recruiting new and replacement dealers that we believe will provide enhanced sales and customer service for our end consumers. We employ proactive processes to monitor the health and performance of our dealers, and to help them improve their businesses and their sales of MasterCraft products. Our strategy is to improve the individual market shares of each of our dealers in their respective markets, and to add new dealers in new markets or replace dealers in existing markets where we believe we can achieve improved market share and customer service. We utilize regular performance reviews to drive improvement in underperforming dealers and to determine how to transition to new dealers when necessary. In addition, we employ a number of tools to assist our dealers in improving their performance, including product, sales, and service training, marketing materials and content, and direct interaction with prospective customers such as our factory concierge service. We encourage and expect our sales representatives to serve as advisors to our dealers, and believe this proactive sales approach leads to better dealer relationships and higher sales of our products. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

All of our boats are designed, manufactured, and lake-tested in our Vonore, Tennessee facility. We are the only boat manufacturer to achieve compliance with all three of the ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems), 14001 (Environmental Management Systems), and 18001 (International Occupational Health and Safety Management System) standards. The rigorous attention to detail with which we design and manufacture our products results in boats of high quality, which allows us to offer a &#8220;stem-to-stern&#8221; five-year warranty that comprehensively covers more parts of our boats than warranties offered by any of our competitors. In recognition of our operational excellence, we were named a 2015 IndustryWeek Best Plant in North America Recipient&#8212;the only boat manufacturer to receive that honor. 

&#160; 

Our boats are built through a continuous flow manufacturing process that encompasses fabrication, assembly, quality management, and testing. Each boat is produced over a six and a half day cycle that includes the fabrication of the hull and deck through gelcoat application and fiberglass lamination, grinding and hole cutting, installation of components, rigging, finishing, detailing, and on-the-water testing. We manufacture certain components and subassemblies for our boats, such as upholstery, and procure other components from third-party vendors and install them on the boat. We have several exclusive supplier partnerships for critical purchased components, such as aluminum billet, towers, and engine packages. We also build custom trailers that match the exact size and color of our boats. 

&#160; 

Our manufacturing efforts are led by Larry Janosek, our Vice President of Operations, who joined us in March 2012 and has more than 18 years of cross-functional business experience in the automotive industry. Our culture of continuous 

&#160;

improvement is aptly captured in one of our core operating principles: &#8220;Seek Perfection.&#8221; Our operations team maintains tight control over all aspects of the process, starting with cross-functional sales planning processes to maximize model mix, daily layered boat audits while products are moving down the line, and real time supervisor-level variance reporting and quality checks that stop the line if defects are identified. 

&#160; 

In addition, we sponsor a number of best practices programs, including: 

&#160; 

Ideas Implemented. Using tools to identify and reduce waste, employees standardize improvement in their work procedures and implement countermeasures to problems identified daily. This program led to tens of thousands of employee improvement suggestions being implemented. 

&#160; 

Kaizen. We chartered and began several different continuous workplace improvement, or Kaizen, projects during the year that use cross-functional teams to improve value and reduce waste in a defined narrow scope of work flow or process. These projects, which take on average one month to complete, have generated improvements including cost savings, improved quality, increased output, and additional capacity. 

&#160; 

Lean Academy. We have institutionalized learning in our organization by teaching employees to utilize efficient tools and processes, which we refer to as &#8220;lean.&#8221; The program has various degrees of development and bronze, silver, and gold certification levels. Participants from all areas of our Company, including manufacturing, product development, and all administrative departments, learn lean manufacturing to enable them to reduce waste and become lean leaders. 

&#160; 

Our active management process has led to the institution of a number of manufacturing and quality control initiatives on the factory floor, such as the implementation of parts bar coding for improved inventory control, the deployment of automated resin counters for greater materials control, a reduction in the number of mold sets used in the manufacturing process to increase run-rates, and an automated quality control system that creates a &#8220;birth certificate&#8221; for every boat throughout our 2,500-check manufacturing process. We have recorded over one million consecutive man-hours without a lost-time accident as of June 30, 2016, an accomplishment that we believe has reduced workers&#8217; compensation claims and warranty costs as our most-experienced employees continue to remain on the job. 

&#160; 

Product Development and Engineering 

&#160; 

We are strategically and financially committed to innovation, as reflected in our dedicated product development and engineering group and evidenced by our track record of new product introduction. Our product development and engineering group comprises 19 professionals. These individuals bring to our product development efforts significant expertise across core disciplines, including boat design, computer-aided design, naval engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. They are responsible for execution of all facets of our new product strategy, starting with design and development of new boat models and innovative features, engineering these designs for manufacturing, and integrating new boats and innovations into production without disruption, at high quality, on time and on budget. Our product development and engineering functions are led by our Vice President of Operations, with significant engagement from our Chief Executive Officer as well as a Strategic Portfolio Management Team which includes senior leadership from Sales, Marketing and Finance, all working together to develop our long-term product and innovation strategies. 

&#160; 

We take a disciplined approach to the management of our product development strategy. We have structured processes to obtain voices of the customer, dealer, and management to guide our long-term product lifecycle and portfolio planning. In addition, extensive testing and coordination with our manufacturing group are important elements of our product development process, which we believe enable us to leverage the lessons from past launches and minimize the risk associated with the release of new products. We have developed a strategy to launch at least three new models each year, which will allow us to renew our product portfolio with innovative offerings at a rate that we believe will be difficult for 

&#160;

our competitors to match without significant additional capital investments. In addition to our new product strategy, we manage a separate innovation development process which allows us to design innovative new features for our boats in a disciplined manner and to launch these innovations in a more rapid time frame and with higher quality. These newly implemented processes have reduced the time to market for our new product pipeline 

&#160; 

Our research and development center is equipped with computer assisted design (&#8220;CAD&#8221;) workstations for design development and computer numerically controlled tool paths for molds and parts. The CAD system allows for integration of vendor design resources to improve accuracy and reduce development time. The CAD system also provides flexibility to change fundamental design characteristics through the elimination of iterative prototyping processes and lowers new product development costs through acceleration of the development cycle. Furthermore, the CAD system also allows much greater precision in use of materials and assembly, reducing warranty and manufacturing start-up costs. Models are tested under extreme conditions to validate performance, safety, failure limits, and design intention. After a boat successfully completes validation, it is ready for final pricing, marketing, scheduling, and production. Our product development expense for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $3.5 million, $3.0 million, and $2.7 million, respectively. 

&#160; 

Suppliers 

&#160; 

We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from our supplier base, including resins, fiberglass, hydrocarbon feedstocks, and steel, as well as product parts and components such as engines and electronic controls, through a sales order process. We maintain long-term contracts with preferred suppliers and informal arrangements with other suppliers. We have not experienced any material shortages in any of our raw materials, product parts, or components. Temporary shortages, when they do occur, usually involve manufacturers of these products adjusting model mix, introducing new product lines, or limiting production in response to an industry-wide reduction in boat demand. 

&#160; 

We are focused on developing our supply chain to enable cost improvement, world-class quality, and continuous product innovation. We have engaged our top suppliers in collaborative preferred supplier relationships and have developed processes including annual cost reduction targets, regular reliability projects, and extensive product testing requirements to ensure that our suppliers produce at low cost and to the highest levels of quality expected of the MasterCraft brand. These collaborative efforts begin at the design stage, with our key suppliers integrated into design and development planning well in advance of launch, which allows us to control costs and to leverage the expertise of our suppliers in developing product innovations. We believe these collaborative relationships with our most important suppliers have contributed to our significant improvements in product quality, innovation, and profitability since 2012. 

&#160; 

The most significant components used in manufacturing our boats, based on cost, are engine packages. We maintain a strong and long-standing relationship with our primary supplier of engine packages, Ilmor, whose affiliates produce engines used in a number of leading racing boats and race cars. Ilmor maintains a full-time customer service and warranty staff located at our office, resulting in extremely efficient management of all engine-related matters, mitigating potential warranty risk. As of June 30, 2016, Ilmor is our largest supplier. We work closely with Ilmor to remain at the forefront of engine design, performance, and manufacturing. Engine packages are the most expensive single item input in the boat-building process and we believe our long-term relationship with Ilmor is a key competitive advantage. 

&#160; 

Transportation 

&#160; 

We utilize third party logistics and transportation services to deliver our boats to our dealer network. We secure trailer loads of one to four boats at our manufacturing facility. Our third party logistics partners transport them to our domestic dealers or to port for international shipments, generally within one week. A select few dealers near our manufacturing facility have elected to manage transportation and arrange for boats to be picked up directly from our manufacturing 

&#160;

facility. Following delivery to port, international shipments are transferred to a third party logistics provider who schedules them for shipment via ocean freight to their destination country. 

&#160; 

Information Technology 

&#160; 

Over the last several years, we have made a significant investment in information technology. Our information technology strategy is to fully integrate IT into our business processes and planning initiatives, including not only our internal information management and communications processes but also our marketing and dealer management efforts. Our IT team has been integral to our marketing efforts through functionality such as the &#8220;Build-a-Boat&#8221; and &#8220;Factory Tour&#8221; features of our website, helping us to develop stronger engagement between us and our end consumers. In addition, our IT infrastructure is an essential component of our dealer management initiatives, allowing for efficient and timely communications with our dealers and a transparent and effective system for dealer orders and production planning. We will continue to invest in our IT infrastructure in order to continue to leverage technology in support of our product development, manufacturing, and marketing strategies. 

&#160; 

Insurance and Product Warranties 

&#160; 

We purchase insurance to cover standard risks in our industry, including policies that cover general product liability, workers&#8217; compensation, auto liability, and other casualty and property risks. Our insurance rates are based on our safety record as well as trends in the insurance industry. We also maintain workers&#8217; compensation insurance and auto insurance policies that are retrospective in that the cost per year will vary depending on the frequency and severity of claims in the policy year. 

&#160; 

We face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that, among other things, the use of our products results in injury. With respect to product liability coverage, we carry customary insurance coverage. Our coverage involves self-insured retentions with primary and excess liability coverage above the retention amount. We have the ability to refer claims to our suppliers and their insurers to pay the costs associated with any claims arising from such suppliers&#8217; products. Our insurance covers such claims that are not adequately covered by a supplier&#8217;s insurance and provides for excess secondary coverage above the limits provided by our suppliers. 

&#160; 

We provide the same product warranties for all of our models. The high quality and durability of our products allow us to offer a &#8220;stem-to-stern&#8221; five-year warranty that comprehensively covers more parts of our boats than warranties offered by any of our competitors. During the warranty period, we reimburse dealers and MasterCraft authorized service facilities for all or a portion of the cost of repair or replacement performed on the products (mainly composed of parts or accessories provided by us and labor costs incurred by dealers or MasterCraft authorized service facilities). Some materials, components or parts of the boat that are not covered by our product warranties are separately warranted by their manufacturers or suppliers. These other warranties include warranties covering engines, among other components. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, and copyright protection, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our rights in our brand, products, and proprietary technology. We also protect our vessel designs through design registrations. This is an important part of our business and we intend to continue protecting our intellectual property. We currently hold 13 U.S. patents and one foreign patent, including a utility patent for an integrated light and tow-line attachment, a design patent for our transom surf seating, and four utility patents for the Gen 2 surf system technology, which is the only surf system that is custom designed for each hull and allows users to customize a four-zone, 20-foot long wake to rider preferences using a sophisticated-yet-easy-to-use interface. Provided that we comply with all statutory maintenance requirements, our patents are expected to expire between 2021 and 2034. We also hold 13 pending 

&#160;

U.S. patent applications (including two provisional applications) and one pending foreign patent application. We also own in excess of 70 registered trademarks in various countries around the world, most notably the MasterCraft name and logo and the Star Series, XSeries, XTSeries, and NXT product family names, and we own several applications for additional registrations. Such trademarks may endure in perpetuity on a country-by-country basis provided that we comply with all statutory maintenance requirements, including continued use of each trademark in each such country. In addition, we own 38 registered U.S. copyrights. Finally, we have registered over 20 vessel hull designs with the U.S. Copyright Office, which will remain in force through at least 2021. 

&#160; 

From time to time, we are involved in intellectual property litigation, either accusing third parties of infringing our intellectual property rights, or defending against third-party claims that we are infringing the intellectual property of others. We are not currently involved in any outstanding intellectual property litigation that we believe, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. However, we cannot predict the outcome of any pending or future litigation, and an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The powerboat industry, including the performance sport boat category, is highly fragmented, resulting in intense competition for customers and dealers. Competition affects our ability to succeed in both the market segments we currently serve and new market segments that we may enter in the future. We compete with several large manufacturers that may have greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do. We also compete with a wide variety of small privately held independent manufacturers. Competition in our industry is based primarily on brand name, price, innovative features, design, and product performance. Please see Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; &#8212; Risks Related to Our Business &#8212; Our industry is characterized by intense competition, which affects our sales and profits. 

&#160; 

Seasonality &#160; 

&#160; 

Our operating results are subject to annual and seasonal fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors, including: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

seasonal variations in retail demand for boats, with a significant majority of sales occurring during peak boating season, which we attempt to manage by providing incentive programs and floor plan subsidies to encourage dealer purchases throughout the year; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

product mix, which is driven by boat model mix and higher option order rates; while sales of all of our boats generate comparable margins, sales of larger boats and boats with optional content produce higher absolute profits; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

inclement weather, which can affect production at our manufacturing facility as well as consumer demand; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

competition from other performance sports boat manufacturers; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

general economic conditions. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Research and development expenditures for fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $3.5 million, $3.0 million and $2.7 million, respectively. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Environmental, Safety, and Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those concerning product safety, environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. We believe that our operations and products are in compliance with these regulatory requirements. We have received certificates from third-party accreditors of compliance with the ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems), 14001 (Environmental Management Systems), and 18001 (International Occupational Health and Safety Management System) standards. Historically, the cost of achieving and maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations has not been material. However, we cannot assure you that future costs and expenses required for us to comply with such laws and regulations, including any new or modified regulatory requirements, or to address newly discovered environmental conditions, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flow. 

&#160; 

We have not been notified of and are otherwise currently not aware of any contamination at our current or former facilities for which we could be liable under environmental laws or regulations and we currently are not undertaking any remediation or investigation activities in connection with any contamination. However, future spills or accidents or the discovery of currently unknown conditions or non-compliances may give rise to investigation and remediation obligations or related liabilities and damage claims, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flow. 

&#160; 

The regulatory programs that impact our business include the following: 

&#160; 

Hazardous Substance and Waste Regulations 

&#160; 

Certain materials used in our manufacturing, including the resins used in production of our boats, are toxic, flammable, corrosive, or reactive and are classified by the federal and state governments as &#8220;hazardous materials.&#8221; Control of these substances is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state pollution control agencies under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and related state programs. Storage of these materials must be maintained in appropriately labelled and monitored containers, and disposal of wastes requires completion of detailed waste manifests and recordkeeping requirements. Any failure by us to properly store or dispose of our hazardous materials could result in liability, including fines, penalties, or obligations to investigate and remediate any contamination originating from our operations. 

&#160; 

OSHA 

&#160; 

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Act imposes standards of conduct for and regulates workplace safety, including limits on the amount of emissions to which an employee may be exposed without the need for respiratory protection or upgraded plant ventilation. Our facilities are regularly inspected by OSHA and by state and local inspection agencies and departments. We believe that our facilities comply in all material aspects with these regulations. We have made a considerable investment in safety awareness programs and provide ongoing safety training for all of our employees. We have implemented a program that requires frequent safety inspections of our facilities by managers and an internal safety committee. The safety committee, which is led by a dedicated Health and Safety professional, prepares a monthly action plan based on its findings. 

&#160; 

Clean Air Act 

&#160; 

The Clean Air Act (the &#8220;CAA&#8221;) and corresponding state rules regulate emissions of air pollutants. Because our manufacturing operations involve molding and coating of fiberglass materials, which involves the emission of certain 

&#160;

volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants, and particulate matter, we are required to maintain and comply with a CAA operating permit (or &#8220;Title V&#8221; permit). Our Title V Permit requires us to monitor our emissions and periodically certify that our emissions are within specified limits. To date, we have not had material difficulty complying with those limits. 

&#160; 

In addition to the regulation of our manufacturing operations, the EPA has adopted regulations stipulating that many marine propulsion engines meet an air emission standard that requires fitting a catalytic converter to the engine. The engines used in our products, all of which are manufactured by third parties, are warrantied by the manufacturers to be in compliance with the EPA&#8217;s emission standards. The additional cost of complying with these regulations has increased our cost to purchase the engines and, accordingly, has increased the cost to manufacture our products. 

&#160; 

If we are not able to pass these additional costs along to our customers, it may have a negative impact on our business and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Boat Safety Standards 

&#160; 

Powerboats sold in the U.S. must be manufactured to meet the standards of certification required by the U.S. Coast Guard. In addition, boats manufactured for sale in the European Community must be certified to meet the European Community&#8217;s imported manufactured products standards. These certifications specify standards for the design and construction of powerboats. We believe that all of our boats meet these standards. In addition, safety of recreational boats is subject to federal regulation under the Boat Safety Act of 1971, which requires boat manufacturers to recall products for replacement of parts or components that have demonstrated defects affecting safety. In the past, we have instituted recalls for defective component parts produced by us or certain of our third-party suppliers. None of these recalls has had a material adverse effect on our Company. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We believe we maintain excellent relations with our employees, treating them as business partners and focusing on building their careers. We have approximately 510 employees as of June 30, 2016. Our employees are fully integrated into our continuous improvement culture and are empowered to seek out waste reduction and cost improvement opportunities throughout our manufacturing process. This engagement resulted in tens of thousands of employee suggestions being implemented for operating improvements. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and since our founding in 1968, we have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage. 

&#160;
