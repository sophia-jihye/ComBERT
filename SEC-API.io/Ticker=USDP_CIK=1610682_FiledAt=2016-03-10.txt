 Item 1. Business 

OVERVIEW 

We are a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed in 2014 by US Development Group LLC, or USD, through its wholly-owned subsidiary USD Group LLC, or USDG, to acquire, develop and operate energy-related logistics assets, including rail terminals and other high-quality and complementary midstream infrastructure. Our principal assets consist of: (i) a crude oil origination terminal in Hardisty, Alberta, Canada, with capacity to load up to two 120-railcar unit trains per day, (ii) a crude oil terminal in Casper, Wyoming, with unit train-capable railcar loading capacity in excess of 100,000 barrels per day, or Bpd, and six customer-dedicated storage tanks with 900,000 barrels, or Bbls, of total capacity and (iii) two unit train-capable ethanol destination terminals in San Antonio, Texas, and West Colton, California. Our terminals provide critical infrastructure allowing our customers to transport energy-related products from multiple supply regions to numerous demand markets that are dependent on these products. In addition, we provide our customers with railcars and fleet services related to the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels by rail under multi-year, take-or-pay contracts. As of December 31, 2015 , our railcar fleet consisted of 3,306 &#32;railcars which we leased from various railcar manufacturers and financial entities, including 2,108 &#32;coiled and insulated, or C&#38;I, railcars. 

We generate substantially all of our operating cash flow from multi-year, take-or-pay contracts for crude oil terminalling services, such as railcar loading for transportation to end markets, storage and blending in on-site tanks, as well as related logistics services. We do not take ownership of the products that we handle nor do we receive any payments from our customers based on the value of such products. We believe rail will continue as an important transportation option for energy producers, refiners and marketers due to its unique advantages relative to other transportation means. Specifically, rail transportation of energy-related products provides flexible access to key demand centers on a relatively low fixed-cost basis with faster physical delivery, while preserving the specific quality of customer products over long distances.

Based on two 120-railcar unit trains comprised of 31,800 gallon (approximately 757 bbls) railcars being loaded at 95% of volumetric capacity per day. Actual amount of crude oil loading capacity may vary based on factors including the size of the unit trains, the size, type and volumetric capacity of the railcars utilized and the type and specifications of crude oil loaded, among other factors. 

(2) 

Based on one 120-railcar unit train comprised of 31,800 gallon (approximately 757 bbls) railcars being loaded at 95% of volumetric capacity per day and up to 56 manifest railcars per day. Actual amount of crude oil loading capacity may vary based on factors including the size of the unit train, the size, type and volumetric capacity of the railcars utilized and the type and specifications of crude oil loaded, among other factors. 

Our multi-year, take-or-pay terminal services agreements are primarily with high-quality, investment grade customers, including major integrated oil companies, refiners and marketers. The terminal services agreements with customers of our Hardisty terminal have an initial term of five years and extend through mid-2019. The terminal services agreements with the three customers of our Casper terminal have initial terms ranging from three to five years and extend through August 2017, October 2018 and September 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the volume-weighted average remaining contract life of our take-or-pay terminal service agreements was approximately 3.4 years. 

In addition to terminalling services, we provide customers with railcars and fleet services under master fleet services agreements on a multi-year, take-or-pay basis for periods ranging from five to nine years. In the aggregate, our master fleet services agreements have a weighted-average remaining contract life of 4.5 &#32;years as of December 31, 2015. 

One of our key strengths is our relationship with our sponsor, USDG. USDG is the sole direct subsidiary of USD. USD and its affiliates are engaged in designing, developing, owning and managing large-scale multi-modal logistics centers and energy-related infrastructure assets across North America. USD was among the first companies to successfully develop the hydrocarbon-by-rail concept and has built or operated unit train-capable terminals with an aggregate capacity of over 850,000 Bpd. Ten of these terminals were subsequently sold in multiple transactions for an aggregate sales price in excess of $740 million. From January 2006 through December 2015 , USD has loaded or handled through its terminal network a total of over 170 million &#32;barrels, or MMbbls, of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels. USD also has a nationally recognized safety record with no reportable spills at any of its terminals since its inception, as defined by the U.S. Department of Transportation, or DOT, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA. USD is currently owned by Energy Capital Partners, Goldman Sachs and certain of USD&#8217;s management team members. 

On September 19, 2014, Energy Capital Partners made a significant investment in USD and indicated an intention to invest an additional $1.0 billion of equity capital in USD, subject to market and other conditions, to support future growth and expansion plans. Energy Capital Partners, together with its affiliates and affiliated funds, is a private equity firm with over $13.0 billion in capital commitments that primarily invests in North America&#8217;s energy infrastructure. Energy Capital Partners has significant energy infrastructure, midstream, master limited partnership and financial expertise to complement its investment in USD. To date, Energy Capital Partners and its affiliated funds have 24 investment platforms with investments in the power generation, electric transmission, midstream and renewable sectors of the energy industry. 

USD, through its direct ownership of USDG, has stated that it intends for us to be its primary growth vehicle in North America. We intend to strategically expand our business by acquiring energy-related logistics assets related to the storage and transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels from both USDG and third parties. We also intend to grow organically by opportunistically pursuing growth projects and enhancing the profitability of our existing assets. We believe that our relationship with USD and its successful project development and operating history, safety track record and industry relationships provide us with many avenues to execute our growth strategy. 

The following chart depicts a simplified organization and ownership structure as of December 31, 2015 . The ownership percentages referred to below illustrate the relationships among us, our general partner, USDG, USD, Energy Capital Partners and Goldman Sachs, and excludes 397,553 &#32;phantom units outstanding under our Long Term Incentive Plan at December 31, 2015 .

BUSINESS STRATEGY 

Our primary business objective is to continue increasing the quarterly cash distributions we make to our unitholders over time. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following business strategies: 

&#8226; 

Generate stable and predictable fee-based cash flows. Substantially all of the operating cash flow we expect to generate is attributable to multi-year, take-or-pay agreements. We intend to continue to seek stable and predictable cash flows by executing additional long-term, take-or-pay agreements with existing and new customers. 

&#8226; 

Pursue accretive acquisitions . We intend to pursue strategic and accretive acquisitions of energy-related logistics assets related to the storage and transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels from both USD and third parties. We consistently evaluate and monitor the marketplace to identify acquisitions within our existing geographies and in new regions that may be pursued independently or jointly with USD. 

&#8226; 

Pursue organic growth initiatives . We intend to pursue organic growth projects and seek operational efficiencies that complement, optimize or improve the profitability of our assets. For example, our Casper terminal includes the foundation for two additional storage tanks, which if constructed, may result in additional long-term volume commitments and cash flows. 

&#8226; 

Maintain a conservative capital structure . We intend to maintain a conservative capital structure which, when combined with our focus on stable, fee-based cash flows, should afford us access to capital at a competitive cost. Consistent with our disciplined financial approach, we intend to fund the capital required for expansion and acquisition projects through a balanced combination of equity and debt financing. We believe this approach provides us the flexibility to effectively pursue accretive acquisitions and organic growth projects as they become available. 

&#8226; 

Maintain safe, reliable and efficient operations . We are committed to safe, efficient and reliable operations that comply with environmental and safety regulations. We strive to continually improve operating performance through our commitment to technologically-advanced logistics and operations systems, employee training programs and other safety initiatives and programs with railroads, railcar producers and first responders. All of our facilities currently meet or exceed applicable government safety regulations and are in compliance with recently enacted orders regarding the movement of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels by rail. We believe these objectives are integral to the success of our business as well as to our access to growth opportunities. 

BUSINESS SEGMENTS 

We conduct our business through two distinct reporting segments: Terminalling services and Fleet services. 

These segments have unique business activities that require different operating strategies. For information relating to revenues from external customers, operating income and total assets for each segment, as well as by geographic area, refer to Note 15. Segment Reporting &#32;of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. For information relating to revenues from material customers, refer to Note 17. Major Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk &#32;of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this Annual Report. 

Terminalling services 

We generate substantially all of our operating cash flow by charging fixed fees for handling energy-related products and providing related services on a multi-year, take-or-pay basis. We do not take ownership of the underlying products that we handle nor do we receive any payments from our customers based on the value of such products. Thus, we have no direct exposure to risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices, although these risks could indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long term. 

Our Terminalling services business consists of the following operations: 

Hardisty Terminal 

Our Hardisty terminal, which commenced operations on June 30, 2014, is an origination terminal where we load various grades of Canadian crude oil received from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin onto railcars for transportation to end markets. Hardisty is one of the major crude oil hubs in North America and is an origination point for export pipelines to the United States. The Hardisty terminal can load up to two 120-railcar unit trains per day and consists of a fixed loading rack with 30 railcar loading positions, a unit train staging area and loop tracks capable of holding five unit trains simultaneously. The terminal is also equipped with an on-site vapor management system that allows our customers to minimize hydrocarbon loss while improving safety during the loading process. Our Hardisty terminal receives inbound deliveries of crude oil through a direct pipeline connection from Gibson Energy Inc.'s, or Gibson's, Hardisty storage terminal. Gibson, one of the largest independent midstream companies in Canada, has 6.0 MMbbls of storage and access to most of the major pipeline systems in the Hardisty hub. Additionally, Gibson has announced that it is constructing an additional 2.9 MMbbls of storage capacity at its Hardisty terminal. The terminal's strategic location and direct pipeline connection to substantial storage capacity provides efficient access to the major producers in the region. Our Hardisty terminal is also connected to Canadian Pacific Railroad&#8217;s North Main Line, a high capacity line with the ability to service key refining markets across North America. 

We have a facilities connection agreement with Gibson under which Gibson operates and maintains a 24-inch diameter pipeline and related facilities connecting Gibson&#8217;s storage terminal with our Hardisty terminal, which we operate and maintain. Gibson is responsible for transporting product through the pipeline to our Hardisty terminal. This pipeline from Gibson's storage terminal is the exclusive means by which our Hardisty terminal receives crude oil. Subject to certain limited exceptions regarding manifest train facilities, our Hardisty terminal is also the exclusive means by which crude oil from Gibson&#8217;s Hardisty storage terminal may be transported by rail. We remit pipeline fees to Gibson for the transportation of crude oil to the Hardisty terminal based on a predetermined formula. The facilities connection agreement also gives Gibson a right of first refusal in the event of a sale of our Hardisty terminal to a third party. The agreement has a 20-year term and will expire in 2034 unless renewed. Our and Gibson&#8217;s obligations under this facilities connection agreement may be suspended in the case of a force majeure event. Additionally, the agreement may be terminated by the non-defaulting party in case of specified events of default. 

Substantially all of the capacity at our Hardisty terminal is contracted under multi-year, take-or-pay terminal services agreements with seven customers. Approximately 83% of our Hardisty terminal&#8217;s utilization is contracted with subsidiaries of five investment grade companies that include major integrated oil companies, refiners and marketers. Each of the terminal services agreements has an initial contract term of five years that extends through mid-2019. Six of the seven Hardisty terminal service agreements have automatic one-year renewal provisions and will terminate only if written notice is given by either party within a specified time period before the end of the initial term or a renewal term. The seventh agreement will renew upon written agreement at least six months prior to the end of the initial term or the then current renewal term. Each of our terminal services agreements contain annual inflation-based rate escalators based upon the consumer price index of either Canada or Alberta. If a force majeure event occurs, a customer&#8217;s obligation to pay us may be suspended, in which case the length of the contract term will be extended by the same duration as the force majeure event. We will not be liable for any losses of crude oil handled at our Hardisty terminal unless due to our negligence. 

Under the terminal services agreements we have entered into with customers of our Hardisty terminal, our customers are obligated to pay the greater of a minimum monthly commitment fee or a throughput fee based on the actual volume of crude oil loaded at our Hardisty terminal. If a customer loads fewer unit trains or barrels than its maximum allotted amount in any given month, that customer will receive a credit for up to six months, which may be used to offset fees on throughput volumes in excess of its minimum monthly commitments in future periods, to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume. 

Casper Terminal 

The Casper terminal, which we acquired in November 2015, is a crude oil storage, blending and railcar loading terminal located in Casper, Wyoming, where Spectra Energy Partners&#8217; Express Pipeline from Western Canada (~280,000 

Bpd of capacity) interconnects with the Platte Pipeline to Wood River, Illinois (~145,000 Bpd of capacity). The Casper terminal currently offers six customer-dedicated storage tanks with 900,000 Bbls of total capacity and unit train-capable railcar loading capacity in excess of 100,000 Bpd. The terminal&#8217;s approximately 300-acre footprint and modular design allow for the addition of a second loading station and an additional 1.1 MMbbls of storage capacity with minimal disruption to existing operations and relatively low incremental capital costs. 

Inbound crude oil is delivered to the Casper terminal primarily through our dedicated 24-inch diameter, six-mile direct pipeline connection from the Express Pipeline, which provides our customers with access to multiple grades of Canadian crude oil. The Casper terminal can also receive volumes through two truck unloading stations. All inbound volumes are fed directly into the customer&#8217;s dedicated storage tank(s), which enhances their ability to control the quality of the product from origin to end market. This also allows customers to blend multiple grades of crude oil to optimize the economics associated with refining varying grades of crude oil. 

Outbound crude oil is loaded onto railcars and then transported to end markets by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, or the BNSF, in either manifest or unit train shipments. The terminal&#8217;s location on the BNSF&#8217;s main line offers advantaged transportation costs to key U.S. refining markets where several customer-preferred destinations are also served by the BNSF. Shipping with a single Class 1 railroad reduces railroad switching fees and enables faster train turn-times, thus improving railcar fleet utilization. 

The Casper terminal commenced operations in September 2014 and is supported by multi-year, take-or-pay agreements with primarily investment grade refiner customers. The initial term of the agreements varies from three to five years, with extension or renewal options for one to three additional years. Under these terminal services agreements, our customers are obligated to pay the greater of a minimum monthly commitment fee or a throughput fee based on the actual volume of crude oil loaded. If a customer loads fewer unit trains or barrels than its maximum allotted amount in any given month, that customer will receive a credit which may be used to offset future throughput fees in excess of the minimum monthly commitment fees, to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume. Unused credits generally expire if not used within a one to six month period, typically at the end of each calendar quarter. 

Ethanol Terminals 

Our San Antonio and West Colton terminals are unit train-capable destination terminals that transload ethanol received by rail from producers onto trucks to meet local ethanol demand. Each terminal is equipped with 20 railcar offloading positions and three truck loading positions. Our terminals receive inbound deliveries exclusively by rail on the Union Pacific railroad's, or the UP's, high speed lines. Located within five miles of San Antonio's gasoline blending terminals, our San Antonio terminal can transload up to 20,000 Bpd of ethanol and is the only ethanol rail terminal within a 20-mile radius. Located less than one mile from gasoline blending terminals that supply the greater San Bernardino and Riverside County-Inland Empire region, our West Colton terminal can transload up to 13,000 Bpd of ethanol and is the only ethanol rail terminal within a ten-mile radius. 

Due to corrosion concerns unique to biofuels such as ethanol, the long-haul transportation of biofuels by multi-product pipelines is less efficient and less economical than transportation by rail. We believe these corrosion concerns, combined with the proximity of our terminals to local demand markets, strategically positions our terminals to benefit from anticipated changes in environmental and gasoline blending regulations that are expected to increase the use of ethanol in the market for transportation fuel. 

We receive fixed fees per gallon of ethanol transloaded at each of our ethanol terminals pursuant to terminal services agreements with subsidiaries of an investment grade company. Our San Antonio terminal services agreement entitles the customer to 100% of the terminal&#8217;s capacity through February 2017, subject to our right to seek additional customers if minimum volume usage thresholds are not met. Our customer has consistently met its minimum utilization requirements since the inception of the agreement; however, they have indicated an intention to build an ethanol terminalling facility near Austin, Texas, which they expect to be operational by December 2016. We are currently assessing what impact, if any, this facility will have on our customer's desire to renew its agreement with us, as well as considering other opportunities available to us at the terminal. Our West Colton terminal operates under a terminal services agreement in place since July 2009, which is terminable at any time by either party. We are seeking permits 

to construct an approximately one-mile pipeline directly from our West Colton terminal to Kinder Morgan Inc.&#8217;s gasoline blending terminals, which, if approved and constructed, may result in long-term volume commitments and cash flows. 

Fleet Services 

We provide our customers with railcars and fleet services related to the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels by rail under master fleet services agreements on a multi-year, take-or-pay basis for periods ranging from five to nine years. We do not own any railcars. As of December 31, 2015 , our fleet consisted of 3,306 &#32;railcars, which we leased from various railcar manufacturers and financial entities. We have assigned certain payment and performance obligations under the leases and master fleet services agreements for 2,653 &#32;of these railcars to related parties associated with USD on an arms-length basis, but we have retained certain rights and obligations with respect to the servicing of these railcars. Approximately 75% &#32;of our current railcar fleet is dedicated to customers of our Hardisty terminal, including an affiliate of USDG. The remaining 25% &#32;of our railcar fleet is dedicated to a customer of terminals belonging to subsidiaries previously sold by our predecessor. The master fleet services agreements we have with certain of our Hardisty terminal customers have a weighted-average remaining contract life of 5.6 &#32;years as of December 31, 2015. In the aggregate, our master fleet services agreements have a weighted-average remaining contract life of 4.5 &#32;years as of December 31, 2015. 

Under the master fleet services agreements, we provide customers with railcar-specific fleet services, which may include, among other things, the provision of relevant administrative and billing services, the maintenance of railcars in accordance with standard industry practice and applicable law, the management and tracking of the movement of railcars, the regulatory and administrative reporting and compliance as required in connection with the movement of railcars, and the negotiation for and sourcing of railcars. Our customers typically pay monthly fees per railcar for these services to us and our assignees, which include a component for railcar use and a component for fleet services. The master fleet services agreements will expire unless notice to renew is provided by our customers. We believe our ability to provide access to high-quality railcars provides an incentive to secure terminalling capacity at our facilities for customers who do not otherwise have access to such railcars. We expect that the longer terms typical of fleet services agreements will also incentivize our customers to extend their initial terminal services agreements with us. 

Approximately 85% of our railcars currently in service were constructed in 2013 and later. The average age of our fleet currently in service is approximately three years, as compared with the estimated 50-year life associated with these types of railcars. We have partnered with leaders in the railcar supply industry, such as CIT Rail, Union Tank Car Company, Trinity Industries and others. We believe that our relationships with these industry leaders enable us to obtain railcar market insight and to procure railcars on advantageous terms, with shorter lead times than some of our competitors. Our current railcars are designed to a minimum DOT-111 railcar standard and are built to carry between 28,000 to 31,800 gallons of bulk liquid volume. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our railcar fleet consisted of a mix of 2,108 &#32;C&#38;I railcars and 1,198 &#32;non-coiled, non-insulated railcars. Our C&#38;I railcars can reheat heavy viscous grades of crude oil, reducing the need to blend these heavier grades with diluents. 

BENEFITS OF RAIL 

The following benefits of rail have become a primary focus for producers, refiners, marketers and other energy-related market participants, and as such, have established, or have the potential to establish, rail as a preferred mode of transportation for crude oil as well as refined petroleum products, biofuels, natural gas liquids, or NGLs, and frac sand/proppant: 

Access to areas without existing or easily accessible transportation infrastructure . Many producing regions, such as the Western Canadian oil sands, have concentrated production in areas with limited existing pipeline takeaway capacity. The extensive existing rail infrastructure network provides efficient takeaway capacity to these producing regions and access to multiple demand centers. 

Faster deployment . Rail terminals can be constructed at a fraction of the time required to lay a long-haul pipeline, providing a timely solution to meet new and evolving market demands. Relative to rail, new pipeline construction faces 

challenges such as lengthier build times and more extensive environmental permitting processes, geographic constraints and, in some cases, the lack of required political and regulatory support. 

Flexibility to deliver to different end markets . Unlike pipelines, which typically transport product to a single demand market, rail offers producers and shippers access to many of the most advantageous demand centers throughout North America, enabling producers and shippers to obtain competitive prices for their products and to retain the flexibility to determine the ultimate destination until the time of transportation. 

Comprehensive solution for refiners . Rail provides refiners flexible access to multiple qualities and grades of crude oil (feedstock) from multiple production sources. Additionally, shipping in railcars improves the ability to preserve the specific quality of the product over long distances relative to pipelines. 

Faster delivery to demand markets . Rail can transport energy-related products to end markets much faster than pipelines, trucks or waterborne tankers. While a pipeline can take 30-45 days to transport crude oil to the Gulf Coast from Western Canada, unit trains can move crude oil along a similar path in approximately nine days. 

Reduced shipper commitment requirements . Whereas all of the pipeline transportation fee is typically subject to long-term shipper commitments, only a portion of rail transportation costs require long-term shipper commitments (railroads are typically contracted on a spot basis). Consequently, pipeline customers bear greater risk of shifts in regional price differentials and the location of demand markets. 

Reduced shipper transportation cost . Rail provides shippers a competitive transportation option, particularly in situations where either (i) the amount of diluent required for the transportation of crude oil by pipeline is high, which is generally the case for production from the Canadian oil sands, or (ii) multiple modes of transportation are required to reach a particular end market. 

FUTURE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES 

We apply a disciplined approach to pursuing our growth strategy, which may include organic growth initiatives as well as acquisitions of energy-related logistics assets. Potential acquisitions may include assets developed by our sponsor or by third party logistics providers. 

Our sponsor is currently pursuing several development projects related to the storage and transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels. These development projects are expected to be supported by long-term take-or-pay agreements with strategic customers which would generate stable and predictable cash flows. Energy Capital Partners has indicated an intention to invest an additional $1.0 billion of equity capital in USD, subject to market and other conditions, to support future growth and expansion plans. 

U.S. Gulf Coast 

In October 2015, our sponsor announced a joint venture to develop a premier U.S. Gulf Coast logistics terminal on a 988-acre parcel of property on the Houston Ship Channel. Preliminary master planning efforts suggest that the property footprint is capable of supporting several million barrels of storage capacity, multiple docks (including barge and deep water), plus a rail terminal with capacity to unload multiple unit trains per day. The advantaged location offers access to substantially all major inbound and outbound pipelines, as well as service by two Class 1 railroads. 

Our sponsor believes this property is uniquely positioned to provide existing and future customers with flexible market access to key demand centers, both domestic and abroad, and is currently engaged in commercial negotiations with potential customers. 

Western Canada 

Industry forecasts project that crude oil production from Western Canada will grow by approximately 700,000 to 1,000,000 Bpd by 2020. Additionally, construction is already underway for over 350,000 Bpd of new oil sands production capacity which is scheduled to be completed by 2017. Currently planned additions to pipeline takeaway 

capacity are not expected to keep pace with expected production growth. However, certain end users, including refineries across North America, have made substantial investments in recent years in order to efficiently process heavy grades of crude oil, such as those from Western Canada. As a result, we believe rail will continue to be a critical part of the overall transportation infrastructure solution and that our Hardisty and Casper terminals are well-positioned to meet future takeaway needs. 

Our sponsor retained the right to develop certain expansions of our Hardisty terminal, which they are actively pursuing. These expansions may include solutions to transport heavier grades of crude oil produced in Western Canada, which our sponsor believes will maximize benefits to producers, refiners and railroads. 

Right of First Offer 

In connection with our IPO, we entered into an omnibus agreement with USD and USDG, pursuant to which we were granted a right of first offer on any midstream infrastructure assets that they may develop, construct, or acquire for a period of seven years after the October 15, 2014, closing of our IPO. Additional information about the omnibus agreement and the right of first offer are included in this Annual Report under Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 

We cannot assure you that USD will be able to develop or construct, or that we or USD will be able to acquire, any additional midstream infrastructure projects. Among other things, the ability of USD to further develop the Hardisty terminal, or any other project, and our ability to acquire such projects, will depend upon USD&#8217;s and our ability to raise additional equity and debt financing. We are under no obligation to make any offer, and USD and USDG are under no obligation to accept any offer we make, with respect to any asset subject to our right of first offer. Additionally, the approval of Energy Capital Partners is required for the sale of any assets by USD or its subsidiaries, including us (other than sales in the ordinary course of business), acquisitions of securities of other entities that exceed specified materiality thresholds and any material unbudgeted expenditures or deviations from our approved budgets. Energy Capital Partners may make these decisions free of any duty to us and our unitholders. This approval would be required for the potential acquisition by us of any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal, as well as any other projects or assets that USD may develop or acquire in the future or any third party acquisition we may pursue independently or jointly with USD. Energy Capital Partners is under no obligation to approve any such transaction. Please refer to the discussion under Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Special Approval Rights of Energy Capital Partners &#32;regarding the rights of Energy Capital Partners. If we are unable to acquire any projects to expand the Hardisty terminal from USD, which USD retained the right to develop and operate at the time of our IPO, these expansions may compete directly with our Hardisty terminal for future throughput volumes, which may impact our ability to enter into new terminal services agreements, including with our existing customers, following the termination of our existing agreements, or the terms thereof, and our ability to compete for future spot volumes. Furthermore, cyclical changes in the demand for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons may cause USD, or us, to further re-evaluate any future expansion projects, including expansion of the Hardisty terminal. 

COMPETITION &#160; 

The energy-related logistics infrastructure business is highly competitive. The ability to secure additional agreements for rail terminalling and railcar fleet services is primarily based on the reputation, efficiency, flexibility, location, market economics and reliability of the services provided and pricing for those services. 

Our Hardisty and Casper terminals face competition from other logistics services providers, such as pipelines and other terminalling service providers. In addition, our customers may also choose to construct or acquire their own terminalling assets. If our customers choose to ship crude oil via alternative means, we may only receive the minimum monthly commitment fees at our Hardisty and Casper terminals. Our San Antonio and West Colton terminals face competition from other terminals and trucks that may be able to supply end-user markets with ethanol and other biofuels on a more competitive basis due to terminal location, price, versatility or services provided. Both of our ethanol terminals are served by the UP. In the Southern California market, we compete directly with ethanol facilities in the Fontana, Carson and San Diego areas, which are served by the BNSF. A combination of rail freight and trucking economics, which comprise the largest share of the value chain, make it very difficult to compete with other facilities in this market based on terminalling throughput fees alone. In the San Antonio market, we also compete with a facility served by the 

BNSF, although our facility, which is served by the UP, is closer to the San Antonio metro area, which typically results in advantaged trucking rates for certain end-user customers. Our San Antonio terminal may also face competition from a proposed new ethanol terminalling facility near Austin, Texas, by the current customer of our San Antonio terminal, which they expect will be operational by December 2016. 

Our railcar fleet services face competition from other providers of railcars. This competition may limit our ability to increase the number of railcars under contract, and thus, limit our ability to increase our revenues. However, we believe our relationships with leaders in the railcar supply industry such as CIT Rail, Union Tank Car Company and Trinity Industries, will enable us to continue procuring railcars on advantageous terms. 

We believe that we are favorably positioned to compete in our industry due to the strategic location of our terminals, quality of service provided at our terminals, independent strategy, our reputation and industry relationships, and the quality, versatility and complementary nature of our services. The competitiveness of our service offerings could be significantly impacted by the entry of new competitors into the markets in which we operate. However, we believe that significant barriers to entry exist in the energy-related logistics business. These barriers include significant costs and execution risk, a lengthy permitting and development cycle, financing challenges, shortage of personnel with the requisite expertise, and a finite number of sites suitable for development. 

SEASONALITY 

The amount of throughput at our terminals is affected by the level of supply and demand for crude oil, refined products and biofuels, as well as, to a lesser extent, seasonality. Demand for gasoline is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction work. However, many effects of seasonality on our revenues are substantially mitigated due to our terminal service agreements with our customers that include minimum monthly commitment fees, as well as our master fleet services agreements which require our customers to pay a base monthly fee per railcar. Furthermore, because there are multiple end markets for the crude oil and biofuels handled at our terminals, the effect of seasonality otherwise attributable to one particular end market is mitigated. 

IMPACT OF REGULATION 

General 

Our operations are subject to complex and frequently-changing federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of health, property and the environment, including laws and regulations that govern the handling and release of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbon materials. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental and safety laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, operate, and upgrade equipment and facilities. While these laws and regulations may affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income, customers typically place additional value on utilizing established and reputable third-party providers to satisfy their terminalling and logistics needs. As a result, we expect to increase our market share in relation to customer-owned operations or smaller operators that lack an established track record of safety and environmental compliance. 

Violations of environmental or safety laws or regulations can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and, in some instances, injunctions banning or delaying certain activities. We believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change at the federal, state, provincial and local levels, and the legislative and regulatory trend has been to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment. 

Our operations contain risks of accidental releases into the environment, such as releases of crude oil, ethanol or hazardous substances from our terminals. To the extent an event is not covered by our insurance policies, such accidental releases could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage, and fines or penalties for any related violations of environmental or safety laws or regulations. 

Air Emissions 

Our operations are subject to and affected by the Clean Air Act, or CAA, and its implementing regulations, as well as comparable state and local statutes and regulations. Our operations are subject to the CAA&#8217;s permitting requirements and related emission control requirements relating to specific air pollutants, as well as the requirement to maintain a risk management program to help prevent accidental releases of certain regulated substances. We are currently required to obtain and maintain various construction and operating permits under the CAA, and have incurred capital expenditures to maintain compliance with all applicable federal and state laws regarding air emissions. We may nonetheless be required to incur additional capital expenditures in the near future for the installation of certain air pollution control devices at our terminals when regulations change, or we add new equipment, or modify our existing equipment. Our Canadian operations are similarly subject to federal and provincial air emission regulations. 

Our customers are also subject to, and similarly affected by, environmental regulations restricting air emissions. These include U.S. and Canadian federal and state or provincial actions to develop programs for the reduction of Greenhouse gases, or GHG, emissions such as proposals to create a cap-and-trade system that would require companies to purchase carbon dioxide emission allowances for emissions at manufacturing facilities and emissions caused by the use of the fuels sold. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, has begun to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. As a result of these regulations, our customers could be required to undertake significant capital expenditures, operate at reduced levels, and/or pay significant penalties. We are uncertain what our customers&#8217; responses to these emerging issues will be. Those responses could reduce throughput at our terminals, and impact our cash flows and ability to make distributions or satisfy debt obligations. 

Climate Change 

United States. &#32;Following its December 2009 &#8220;endangerment finding&#8221; that GHG emissions pose a threat to public health and welfare, the EPA has begun to regulate GHG emissions under the authority granted to it by the federal CAA. Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal CAA that require Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD pre-construction permits and Title V operating permits for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources. Under these regulations, facilities required to obtain PSD permits must meet &#8220;best available control technology&#8221; standards for their GHG emissions established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain onshore oil and natural gas processing and fractionating facilities and, starting in October 2015, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting activities as well as natural gas transmission pipelines. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all GHG emissions permitting and reporting requirements applicable to our operations. 

While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, the prospect for adoption of significant legislation at the federal level to reduce GHG emissions is perceived to be low at this time. Nevertheless, the Obama administration has proposed comprehensive regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs and to encourage greater use of low-carbon technologies. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations that limit emissions of GHGs could adversely affect the demand for crude oil, which could thereby reduce demand for our services. Finally, increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, although not scientifically proven, are believed to produce climate changes that can have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, it is uncertain if they would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Canada . In response to studies suggesting that emissions of CO 2 , methane and certain other gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, over 190 countries, including Canada, committed to a legally binding treaty to reduce GHG emissions, the terms of which were defined at the Paris climate conference in December 2015. The terms of the Paris treaty to reduce GHG emissions are to become effective in 2020. With regard to the oil and gas industry, it is unclear at this time what direction the Canadian government plans to take. Increased costs associated with compliance with any future legislation or regulation of GHG emissions, if it occurs, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, climate change legislation and regulations may result in increased costs not only for our business but also for our customers, thereby potentially 

decreasing demand for our services. Decreased demand for our services may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Waste Management and Related Liabilities 

To a large extent, the environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations relate to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into soils, groundwater, and surface water, and include measures to control pollution of the environment. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. They also require corrective action, including investigation and remediation, at a facility where such waste may have been released or disposed. 

Site Remediation . The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly referred to as CERCLA or Superfund, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or to the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons regarding the presence or release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; in (or into) the environment. Those persons include the former and present owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and the transporters and generators of the hazardous substance found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances and for damages to natural resources. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties, to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the &#32; responsible classes of persons. Claims filed for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment are not uncommon from neighboring landowners and other &#32; third parties. Petroleum products are typically excluded from CERCLA&#8217;s definition of &#8220;hazardous substances.&#8221; In the ordinary course of operating our business, we do not handle wastes that are designated as hazardous substances and, as a result, we have limited exposure under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have been released into the environment. Costs for any such remedial actions, as well as any related claims, could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses to the extent not covered by insurance. Canadian and provincial laws also impose liabilities for releases of certain substances into the environment. 

&#160; 

We currently own or lease properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, and comparable state and Canadian federal and provincial laws and regulations. Under these laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater), or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We have not been identified by any state or federal agency as a Potentially Responsible Party under CERCLA in connection with the transport and/or disposal of any waste products to third-party disposal sites. We maintain insurance of various types with varying levels of coverage that we consider adequate under the circumstances to cover our operations and properties. The insurance policies are subject to deductibles and retention levels that we consider reasonable and not excessive. Consistent with insurance coverage generally available in the industry, in certain circumstances our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to certain pollution events, including gradual pollution or sudden and accidental occurrences. 

&#160; 

Solid and Hazardous Wastes . Our operations generate solid wastes, including some hazardous wastes, which are subject to the requirements of RCRA and analogous state and Canadian federal and provincial laws that impose requirements on the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes. Many of the &#32; wastes that we generate are not subject to the most stringent requirements of RCRA because our operations generate primarily oil and gas wastes, which currently are excluded from consideration as RCRA hazardous wastes. Specifically, RCRA excludes from the definition of hazardous waste produced waters and other wastes intrinsically associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil and natural gas. However, these oil and gas exploration and production wastes may still be regulated under state solid waste laws and regulations. Oil and gas wastes may be included as hazardous wastes under &#32; RCRA in the future, in which event our wastes as well as the wastes of our competitors will be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements, resulting in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses. &#32; 

&#160; 

Water 

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, or CWA, and analogous state and Canadian federal and provincial laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters of the United States or into any type of water body in Canada, as well as state and provincial waters. Federal, state and provincial regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and comparable laws, in addition to requiring remedial action to clean up such water body and surrounding land. 

&#160; 

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, amended certain provisions of the CWA, as they relate to the release of petroleum products into navigable waters. OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict, joint and potentially unlimited liability for containment and removal costs, natural resource damages, and certain other consequences of an oil spill. These laws impose regulatory burdens on our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable OPA requirements. State and Canadian federal and provincial laws also impose requirements relating to the prevention of oil releases and the remediation of areas affected by releases when they occur. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all such federal, state and Canadian requirements. 

Endangered Species Act 

The Endangered Species Act restricts activities that may affect endangered species or their habitats. While some of our facilities are in areas that may be designated as habitat for endangered species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the Endangered Species Act. However, the discovery of previously unidentified endangered species could cause us to incur additional costs, or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected area. 

&#160; 

Rail Safety 

We facilitate the transport of crude oil and related products by rail in the United States and Canada. We do not own or operate the railroads on which crude-oil-carrying railcars are transported; however, we currently lease or manage a large railcar fleet on behalf of our customers. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to regulations governing railcar design and manufacture, and increasingly stringent regulations pertaining to the shipment of crude oil by rail. 

&#160; 

High-profile accidents involving crude oil unit trains in Quebec, North Dakota,Virginia, West Virginia and Illinois, have raised concerns about the environmental and safety risks associated with transporting crude oil by rail, and the associated risks arising from railcar design. In August 2013, the Federal Railroad Administration, or FRA, issued both an Action Plan for Hazardous Materials Safety, and an order imposing new standards on railroads for properly securing rolling equipment; a proposed rule with regard to the latter was subsequently released in September, 2014. In August 2013, the FRA and PHMSA began conducting inspections of crude-oil-carrying railcars from the Bakken formation to make sure cargo is properly identified to railroads and emergency responders. In February 2014, the DOT and transportation industry agreed to certain voluntary measures designed to enhance the safety of crude oil shipments by rail, which include lowering speed limits for crude oil trains traveling in high-risk areas, modifying routes to avoid such high-risk areas, increasing the frequency of track inspections, implementing improved braking mechanisms, and improving the training of certain emergency responders. 

February 2014, as amended and restated in March 2014, the DOT issued another order, immediately requiring all carriers who transport crude oil from the Bakken region by rail to ensure that the product is properly tested and classified in accordance with federal safety regulations, and further requiring that all crude oil shipments be designated in the two highest risk categories, effectively mandating that crude oil be transported in more robust railcars. Any person failing to comply with the order is subject to potential civil penalties up to $175,000 for each violation or for each day they are found to be in violation, as well as potential criminal prosecution. Similarly, in February 2014, the Canadian Department of Transport, which we refer to as Transport Canada, finalized new regulations requiring shippers and carriers of crude oil by rail to properly sample, classify, certify and disclose certain characteristics of the crude oil being shipped, and gave shippers and carriers six months to comply with these new regulatory procedures. In April 2014, the Canadian Minister of Transport, who oversees Transport Canada, announced a series of directives and other actions to address the Transportation Safety Board of Canada&#8217;s initial recommendations on rail safety. Effective immediately, Transport Canada prohibited the least crash-resistant and non-upgraded or retrofitted DOT-111 railcars from carrying 

dangerous goods. Additionally, Transport Canada ordered DOT-111 railcars used to transport crude oil and ethanol that are not compliant with required safety standards be phased out or retrofitted by May 2017; thereafter, retrofitted DOT-111 railcars will be permitted to be used only with respect to certain packing groups until May 2025. We currently provide railcar services for 2,731 railcars that are subject to this directive, but which have leases that will expire before they are required to be retrofitted, and 375 railcars that will still be under contract and will be required to be retrofitted pursuant to this directive. We do not own any of the railcars in our railcar fleet and are not directly responsible for costs associated with the retrofitting of DOT-111 railcars. However, costs associated with the retrofitting of railcars would increase the incremental monthly cost of the applicable railcar lease, which cost we would seek to pass through to our customers and could affect demand for our services. We are currently working with our railcar suppliers on modification scheduling in an attempt to avoid disruptions. Transport Canada also identified key routes and revised operating practices put in place for the transportation of crude oil on those routes. 

In May, 2014, the DOT issued another order, immediately requiring railroads operating trains carrying more than one million gallons of Bakken crude oil to notify State Emergency Response Commissions regarding the estimated volume, frequency, and transportation route of those shipments. Also in May 2014, the FRA and PHMSA issued a joint Safety Advisory to the rail industry advising those shipping or offering Bakken crude oil to use railcar designs with the highest available level of integrity, and to avoid using older legacy DOT-111 or CTC-111 railcars. In July 2014, Transport Canada adopted the CPC-1232 technical standards as the minimum safety threshold for railcars transporting dangerous goods after May 2017. Transport Canada also proposed a new class of railcar (TC-140) specifically developed for the transport of flammable liquids in Canada, as well as a retrofit schedule for legacy DOT-111 and CPC-1232 railcars. The proposal was open for comment until September 1, 2014. 

In May 2015, the DOT, in coordination with Transport Canada, finalized new rail safety rules. The final rule includes stiffer construction standards for rail tank cars constructed after October 1, 2015. The final rule also creates a new North American tank car standard known as the DOT Specification 117 (DOT-117) with thicker steel and redesigned bottom outlet valves, among other improvements over the DOT-111 tank car. U.S. crude oil shippers will have until January 1, 2018 to phase out or upgrade older DOT-111 tank cars, while Canadian shippers will be required to phase DOT-111 cars out of crude oil service by May 1, 2017. The rule will also require companies hauling crude in the U.S. or Canada to retrofit or phase out non-jacketed CPC-1232 tank cars by April 1, 2020. In addition, the final rule includes mandates for using electronically controlled pneumatic braking systems and for performing routing analyses, and makes permanent the provisions of an emergency order issued by DOT in April 2015 imposing a speed limit of 40 miles per hour (mph) in high-threat urban areas for crude oil trains containing at least one older-model tank car. The speed limit for all other crude-by-rail service will be restricted to 50 mph, in line with the speed limit railroads voluntarily adopted in 2013. The final rule requires offerors to develop and carry out sampling and testing programs for all unrefined petroleum-based products, including crude oil, and to certify that hazardous materials subject to the program are packaged in accordance with the test results, but does not require oil companies to process their products to make them less volatile before shipment. 

We believe that the current retrofit timelines that have been released to date should provide us with sufficient time to make any changes to our railcar fleet that is required due to these new regulations. Nearly 85% of our fleet was manufactured in 2013 and 2014 and has been constructed to the CPC-1232 standard. Were DOT to adopt more strict specifications for tank cars, it would likely result in increased difficulty and costs to obtain compliant cars after the applicable phase-out dates. While we may be able to pass some of these costs on to our customers, there may be additional costs that we cannot pass on to our customers. We are continuously monitoring the railcar regulatory landscape and remain in close contact with railcar suppliers and other industry stakeholders to stay informed of railcar regulation rulemaking developments. Given the current railcar design compliance requirements and timelines outlined in the most recent Transport Canada and DOT rules, we do not anticipate a material impact to our ability to transport crude oil under our existing contracts. If future rulemakings result in more stringent design requirements and compressed compliance timelines, then our ability to transport these volumes could be affected by a delay in the railcar industry&#8217;s ability to provide adequate railcar modification repair services. We may not have access to a sufficient number of compliant cars to transport the required volumes under our existing contracts. This may lead to a decrease in revenues and other consequences. &#160; 

The adoption of additional federal, state, provincial or local laws or regulations, including any voluntary measures by the rail industry regarding railcar design or crude oil and liquid hydrocarbon rail transport activities, or efforts by local communities to restrict or limit rail traffic involving crude oil, could affect our business by increasing compliance costs and decreasing demand for our services, which could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows. 

Crude Oil Pipeline Safety 

In connection with our acquisition of the Casper terminal and related facilities, we became subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, the DOT through PHMSA as well as other federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the operation of our dedicated crude oil pipeline, rates charged for transportation service, and protection of health, property and the environment. The transportation and storage of crude oil and refined petroleum products involve a risk that hazardous liquids may be released into the environment, potentially causing harm to the public or the environment. In turn, such incidents may result in substantial expenditures for response actions, significant government penalties, liability to government agencies for natural resources damages, and significant business interruption. DOT has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection and management of our crude oil pipeline and related assets. These regulations contain requirements for the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs, which include the inspection and testing of pipelines and necessary maintenance or repairs. These regulations also require that pipeline operation and maintenance personnel meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans. 

We are subject to regulation by the DOT under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, also known as the HLPSA. The HLPSA delegated to DOT the authority to develop, prescribe, and enforce minimum federal safety standards for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline. Congress also enacted the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, also known as the PSA, which added the environment to the list of statutory factors that must be considered in establishing safety standards for hazardous liquid pipelines, required that regulations be issued to define the term &#8220;gathering line&#8221; and that safety standards for certain &#8220;regulated gathering lines&#8221; be established, and mandated that regulations be issued to establish criteria for operators to use in identifying and inspecting pipelines located in High Consequence Areas, or HCAs, defined as those areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage, that cross a navigable waterway, or that have a high population density. In 1996, Congress enacted the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act, also known as the APSPA, which limited the operator identification requirement mandate to pipelines that cross a waterway where a substantial likelihood of commercial navigation exists, required that certain areas where a pipeline rupture would likely cause permanent or long-term environmental damage be considered in determining whether an area is unusually sensitive to environmental damage, and mandated that regulations be issued for the qualification and testing of certain pipeline personnel. In the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006, also known as the PIPES Act, Congress required mandatory inspections for certain U.S. crude oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in HCAs and mandated that regulations be issued for low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines and pipeline control room management. We are also subject to the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, which reauthorized funding for federal pipeline safety programs through 2015, increased penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines, and required studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. New pipeline safety legislation that would reauthorize the federal pipeline safety programs of PHMSA through 2019 has been introduced and is expected to be considered by Congress in 2016. 

PHMSA administers compliance with these statutes and has promulgated comprehensive safety standards and regulations for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline. In October 2010, PHMSA issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking on a range of topics relating to the safety of crude oil and other hazardous liquids pipelines. Among other items, the advance notice of proposed rulemaking requested comment on whether to extend regulation to certain pipelines currently exempt from federal safety regulations; whether to extend integrity management regulations to additional pipelines or to include additional pipelines in HCAs; and whether to require emergency flow-restricting devices and revise valve spacing requirements for new or existing pipelines. On October 13, 2015, PHMSA took action on certain of the issues raised in the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking, and issued a proposed rule that would significantly increase the number of miles of pipelines subject to the integrity management requirement. The proposed rule would also increase the responsibilities and obligations for hazardous liquid (including crude oil, 

condensate, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and liquefied natural gas) pipeline operators that are already subject to integrity management requirements. In addition, PHMSA recently published an advisory bulletin providing guidance on verification of records related to pipeline maximum operating pressure, and in July 2015 issued a separate regulatory proposal that would impose pipeline incident prevention and response measures on natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators. 

We monitor the structural integrity of our pipeline system through a program of periodic internal assessments using high resolution internal inspection tools, as well as hydrostatic testing and direct assessment that conforms to federal standards. We accompany these assessments with a review of the data and repair anomalies, as required, to ensure the integrity of the pipeline. We then utilize sophisticated risk algorithms and a comprehensive data integration effort to ensure that the highest risk areas receive the highest priority for scheduling subsequent integrity assessments. We use external coatings and impressed current cathodic protection systems to protect against external corrosion. We conduct all cathodic protection work in accordance with National Association of Corrosion Engineers standards. We continually monitor, test, and record the effectiveness of these corrosion inhibiting systems. 

Crude Oil Pipeline Rate Regulation 

The rates we charge for use of our dedicated crude oil pipeline are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. FERC regulates the transportation of crude oil on our dedicated Casper pipeline under the Interstate Commerce Act, or ICA, Energy Policy Act of 1992, or EPAct 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. FERC regulations require that rates charged by pipelines that provide transport services in interstate or foreign commerce for crude oil and refined petroleum products (collectively referred to as &#8220;petroleum pipelines&#8221;) and certain other liquids, be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory, and that they do not confer any undue preference upon any shipper. FERC regulations also require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their transportation rates and terms and conditions of service. Under the ICA, FERC or interested persons may challenge existing or changed rates or services. FERC is authorized to investigate such charges and may suspend the effectiveness of a new rate for up to seven months. A successful rate challenge could result in a common carrier paying refunds together with interest for the period that the rate was in effect. FERC may also order a pipeline to change its rates, and may require a common carrier to pay shippers reparations for damages sustained for a period up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint. 

EPAct 1992 required FERC to establish a simplified and generally applicable methodology to adjust tariff rates for inflation for interstate petroleum pipelines. As a result, FERC adopted an indexing rate methodology which, as currently in effect, allows common carriers to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, or PPIFG. FERC&#8217;s indexing methodology is subject to review every five years. During the five-year period commencing July 1, 2011 and ending June 30, 2016, common carriers charging indexed rates are permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by PPIFG plus 2.65%. Beginning July 1, 2016, the indexing method will provide for annual changes equal to the change in PPIFG plus 1.23%. The indexing methodology is applicable to existing rates, including grandfathered rates, with the exclusion of market-based rates. A pipeline is not required to raise its rates up to the index ceiling, but it is permitted to do so and rate increases made under the index are presumed to be just and reasonable unless a protesting party can demonstrate that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline&#8217;s increase in costs. Under the indexing rate methodology, in any year in which the index is negative, pipelines must file to lower their rates if those rates would otherwise be above the rate ceiling. 

While common carriers often use the indexing methodology to change their rates, common carriers may elect to support proposed rates by using other methodologies such as cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates, and settlement rates. A pipeline can follow a cost-of-service approach when seeking to increase its rates above the rate ceiling (or when seeking to avoid lowering rates to the reduced rate ceiling). A common carrier can charge market-based rates if it establishes that it lacks significant market power in the affected markets. In addition, a common carrier can establish rates under settlement if agreed upon by all current shippers. We have used settlement rates for our dedicated crude oil pipeline. If we used cost-of-service rate making to establish or support our rates, the issue of the proper allowance for federal and state income taxes could arise. In 2005, FERC issued a policy statement stating that it would permit common carriers, among others, to include an income tax allowance in cost-of-service rates to reflect 

actual or potential tax liability attributable to a regulated entity&#8217;s operating income, regardless of the form of ownership. Under FERC&#8217;s policy, a tax pass-through entity seeking such an income tax allowance must establish that its partners or members have an actual or potential income tax liability on the regulated entity&#8217;s income. Whether a pipeline&#8217;s owners have such actual or potential income tax liability is subject to review by FERC on a case-by-case basis. Although this policy is generally favorable for common carriers that are organized as pass-through entities, it still entails rate risk due to the FERC&#8217;s case-by-case review approach. The application of this policy, as well as any decision by FERC regarding our cost of service, may also be subject to review in the courts. 

Intrastate services provided by our pipeline are subject to regulation by the Wyoming Public Service Commission. This state commission uses a complaint-based system of regulation, both as to matters involving rates and priority of access. The Wyoming Public Service Commission could limit our ability to increase our rates or to set rates based on our costs or order us to reduce our rates and require the payment of refunds to shippers. FERC and state regulatory commissions generally have not investigated rates, unless the rates are the subject of a protest or a complaint. However, FERC, or a state commission, could investigate our rates on its own initiative or at the urging of a third party. 

If our rate levels were investigated by FERC or a state commission, the inquiry could result in a comparison of our rates to those charged by others or to an investigation of our costs, including: 

&#8226; 

the overall cost of service, including operating costs and overhead; 

&#8226; 

the allocation of overhead and other administrative and general expenses to the regulated entity; 

&#8226; 

the appropriate capital structure to be utilized in calculating rates; 

&#8226; 

the appropriate rate of return on equity and interest rates on debt; 

&#8226; 

the rate base, including the proper starting rate base; 

&#8226; 

the throughput underlying the rate; and 

&#8226; 

the proper allowance for federal and state income taxes 

If the FERC, or the Wyoming Public Service Commission, on their own initiative or due to challenges by third parties, were to lower our tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types, or terms and conditions, of service we might propose, the profitability of our pipeline and terminal located in Casper, Wyoming, may suffer. 

Employee Safety 

We are subject to the requirements of the U.S. federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state and Canadian federal and provincial statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard and the Canadian Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System, or WHMIS, require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA in the United States and comparable state and Canadian federal and provincial requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances. &#160; 

Security 

While we are not currently subject to governmental standards for the protection of computer-based systems and technology from cyber threats and attacks, proposals to establish such standard are being considered in the U.S. Congress and by U.S. Executive Branch departments and agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, and we may become subject to such standards in the future. We currently are implementing our own cyber security programs and protocols; however, we cannot guarantee their effectiveness. A significant cyber-attack could have a material effect on our operations and those of our customers. 

EMPLOYEES 

We are managed and operated by the board of directors and executive officers of USD Partners GP LLC, our general partner. Neither we nor our subsidiaries have any employees. Our general partner has the sole responsibility 

for providing the employees and other personnel necessary to conduct our operations. All of the employees that conduct our business are employed by affiliates of our general partner. Our general partner and its affiliates have approximately 68 &#32;employees performing services for our operations. We believe that our general partner and its affiliates have a satisfactory relationship with those employees. 

INSURANCE 

Our rail terminals, pipeline, storage tanks and railcars may experience damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. We maintain insurance and are insured under the property, business interruption and liability policies of USD and certain of its subsidiaries, subject to the deductibles and limits under those policies, which we consider to be reasonable and prudent under the circumstances to cover our operations and assets. However, such insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our logistics assets, and we cannot ensure that such insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal and property damage, or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices. Although we believe that our assets are adequately covered by insurance, a substantial uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. As we grow, we will continue to monitor our policy limits and retentions as they relate to the overall cost and scope of our insurance program.
