 Item 1. Business. General Development of Business 

Skyline Corporation was originally incorporated in Indiana in 1959, as successor to a business founded in 1951. Skyline Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (the &#147;Corporation&#148;, &#147;Skyline&#148;) designs, produces and markets manufactured housing, modular housing and park models to independent dealers and manufactured housing communities located throughout the United States and Canada. Manufactured housing is built to standards established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, modular homes are built according to state, provincial or local building codes, and park models are built according to specifications established by the American National Standards Institute. 

The Corporation sold 3,217 manufactured homes, 360 modular homes and 337 park models in fiscal 2016. 

The Corporation&#146;s housing products are marketed under a number of trademarks. They are available in lengths ranging from 30&#146; to 76&#146; and in singlewide widths from 12&#146; to 18&#146;, doublewide widths from 18&#146; to 32&#146;, and triplewide widths from 36&#146; to 46&#146;. The area of a singlewide ranges from approximately 400 to 1,200 square feet, a doublewide from approximately 700 to 2,400 square feet, and a triplewide from approximately 1,600 to 2,900 square feet. 

As noted in &#147;Discontinued Operations&#148; in Item 7, the Corporation sold its recreational vehicle business during fiscal 2015 in order to focus on its core housing business. The Corporation&#146;s park model business, which was formerly reported in the recreational vehicle segment, was not disposed as part of the sale and is now reported in the housing segment because net sales do not warrant separate segment reporting. 

Financial Information about Segments 

The Corporation operates in one business segment: housing. Prior to fiscal 2015, the Corporation reported net sales, operating results and total assets in two business segments; housing and recreational vehicles. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, however, the Corporation made a strategic decision to exit the recreational vehicle industry in order to focus on its core housing business. In this regard, in October 2014 the Corporation sold substantially all of its recreational vehicle-related assets to Evergreen Recreational Vehicles, LLC. Operating results of the former recreational vehicle business are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented herein, and the recreational vehicle segment is no longer included in segment reporting (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

Narrative Description of Business 

Principal Products and Markets 

The Corporation&#146;s homes are marketed under a number of trademarks, and are available in a variety of dimensions. Manufactured housing models are built according to standards established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 

Modular homes are built according to state, provincial or local building codes. Each home typically includes two to four bedrooms, kitchen, dining area, living room, one or two bathrooms, kitchen appliances, central heating and cooling. Custom options may include but are not limited to: exterior dormers and windows; interior or exterior accent columns; fireplaces and whirlpool tubs. Materials used to construct a manufactured or a modular home are similar to those used in site-built housing. The Corporation also sells homes that are &#147;Energy-Star&#148; compliant. 

Park models are marketed under the &#147;Shore Park&#148; trademark. The Corporation&#146;s park models are intended to provide temporary living accommodations for individuals seeking leisure travel and outdoor recreation. 

The principal markets for manufactured and modular housing are the suburban and rural areas of the continental United States and Canada. The principal buyers continue to be individuals over the age of fifty, but the market tends to broaden when conventional housing becomes more difficult to purchase and finance. 

&#160; 

Item 1. Business. &#151; (Continued). Principal Products and Markets &#151; (Continued) 

&#160; 

The park model market is made up of primarily vacationing families and retired couples. 

The Corporation provides the retail purchaser of its homes and park models with a full fifteen-month warranty against defects in design, materials and workmanship. The warranties are backed by service departments located at the Corporation&#146;s manufacturing facilities and an extensive field service system. 

The amount and percentage of net sales contributed by manufactured housing, modular housing and park model products is noted in Item 7. 

Method of Distribution 

The Corporation&#146;s products are distributed by approximately 290 independent dealers at 580 locations throughout the United States and Canada. These are generally not exclusive dealerships and it is believed that most dealers also sell products of other manufacturers. 

The Corporation&#146;s products are sold to dealers either through floor plan financing with various financial institutions or on a cash basis. Payments to the Corporation are made either directly by the dealer or by financial institutions, which have agreed to finance dealer purchases of the Corporation&#146;s products. In accordance with industry practice, certain financial institutions which finance dealer purchases require the Corporation to execute repurchase agreements in which the Corporation agrees, that in the event a dealer defaults on its repayment of the financing, the Corporation will repurchase its products from the financial institution in accordance with a declining repurchase price schedule agreed to by the financial institution and the Corporation. Any loss under these agreements is the difference between the repurchase cost and the resale value of the units repurchased. Further, the risk of loss is spread over numerous dealers. 

The Corporation had losses related to repurchases of $50,000 in fiscal year 2016, and losses of $177,000 in fiscal year 2015. 

Additional information regarding these repurchase agreements is included in Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. 

Raw Materials and Supplies 

The Corporation is basically an assembler and installer of components purchased from outside sources. The major components used by the Corporation are electrical components, lumber, plywood, shingles, vinyl and wood siding, steel, aluminum, insulation, home appliances, furnaces, plumbing fixtures, hardware, floor coverings and furniture. The suppliers are many and range in size from large national companies to very small local companies. At the present time the Corporation is obtaining sufficient materials to fulfill its needs. 

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions 

The Corporation does not rely upon any terminable or nonrenewable rights such as patents, licenses or franchises under the trademarks or patents of others, in the conduct of its business. 

Seasonal Fluctuations 

While the Corporation maintains production of homes and park models throughout the year, seasonal fluctuations in sales do occur. Sales and production of homes are affected by winter weather conditions at the Corporation&#146;s northern plants. Park model sales are generally higher in the spring and summer months than in the fall and winter months. 

Inventory 

The Corporation does not maintain significant finished goods inventories. In addition, there are no inventories sold on consignment.

Dependence Upon Individual Customers 

During fiscal 2016, net sales of homes and park models to Sun Home Services, Inc. (&#147;Sun Home&#148;) totaled approximately $22,231,000 or 10 percent of total net sales. During fiscal 2015, net sales to this customer totaled $20,187,000 or 11 percent of total net sales. Based on the current volume of sales to Sun Home, if the Corporation experienced a loss of Sun Home as a customer or Sun Home significantly reduced its volume of purchases from the Corporation, this could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the Corporation. No other individual customer in fiscal 2016 and 2015 had net sales greater than 10 percent of net total sales. 

Backlog 

The Corporation does not consider the existence and extent of backlog to be significant in its business. The Corporation&#146;s production is based on a relatively short manufacturing cycle and customer orders, which continuously fluctuate. 

As such, the existence of backlog is insignificant at any given date and does not typically provide a reliable indication of the status of the Corporation&#146;s business. 

Government Contracts 

The Corporation has had no government contracts during the past three years. 

Competitive Conditions 

The Corporation&#146;s primary competitors range from multi-billion dollar corporations to relatively small and specialized manufacturers. The principal methods of competition include but are not limited to price, features, service, warranty and product performance. Service and product performance are believed to be competitive advantages, while lack of vertical integration is considered a competitive disadvantage. The Corporation also competes with companies that provide other forms of housing, such as new and existing site-built homes, apartments, condominiums and townhouses. 

The following tables show the Corporation&#146;s competitive position on a calendar and fiscal year basis in the product lines it sells.

The Corporation&#146;s business is affected by the availability of wholesale and retail financing. Consequently, increases in interest rates and the availability of credit through governmental action or otherwise, have adversely affected the Corporation&#146;s business in the past and may do so again in the future. 

&#160; 

Item 1. Business. &#151; (Continued). &#160; 

Environmental Quality 

The Corporation believes that compliance with federal, state and local requirements with respect to environmental quality will not require any material capital expenditures for plant or equipment modifications which would adversely affect earnings. 

Government Regulations 

The manufacture, distribution and sale of manufactured housing, modular housing and park models are subject to government regulations in the United States at federal, state and local levels. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has set national manufactured home construction and safety standards and implemented recall and other regulations since 1976. The National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, as amended, under which such standards and regulations are promulgated, prohibits states from establishing or continuing in effect any manufactured home standard that is not identical to the federal standards as to any covered aspect of performance. Implementation of these standards and regulations involves inspection agency approval of manufactured home designs, plant and home inspection by states or other HUD-approved third parties, manufacturer certification that the standards are met, and possible recalls if they are not or if homes contain safety hazards. 

HUD has promulgated rules requiring producers of manufactured homes to utilize wood products certified by their suppliers to meet HUD&#146;s established limits on formaldehyde emissions, and to place in each home written notice to prospective purchasers of possible adverse reaction from airborne formaldehyde in the homes. These rules are designated as preemptive of state regulation. Some components of manufactured and modular housing may also be subject to Consumer Product Safety Commission standards and recall requirements. 

Regarding park models, the Corporation has voluntarily subjected itself to third party inspection in order to further assure the Corporation, its dealers, and customers of compliance with established standards. 

Manufactured housing, modular housing and park model sales may be subject to the Magnuson &#150; Moss Warranty &#150; Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, which regulates warranties on consumer products. 

The Corporation&#146;s operations are subject to the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, and are routinely inspected thereunder. 

The transportation and placement (in the case of manufactured and modular housing) of the Corporation&#146;s products are subject to state highway use regulations and local ordinances which control the size of units that may be transported, the roads to be used, speed limits, hours of travel, and allowable locations for manufactured homes and communities. 

The Corporation is also subject to many state manufacturer licensing and bonding requirements, and to dealer day in court requirements in some states. 

The Corporation believes that it is currently in compliance with the above regulations. 

Number of Employees 

The Corporation employed approximately 1,350 people at May 31, 2016.
