GENERAL 

&#160;

Table Trac, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Table Trac&#8221;) is a Nevada corporation, formed on June 27, 1995, with principal offices in Minnetonka, Minnesota.

The Company has developed and patented (U.S. patent # 5,957,776) a proprietary information and management system (called our &#8220;Table Trac&#8221; system) that automates and monitors the operations of casino table game operations. In addition to its table games management system, Table Trac has been adding functionality to related casino system modules for guest rewards and loyalty club, marketing analysis, guest service, promotions, administration / management, vault / cage management and audit / accounting tasks. Aggregated together, all of these modules have become the &#8220;Casino Trac&#8221; product, a full-featured Casino Management System (CMS) offering what we believe to be a powerful combination of value, efficiency and reliability for casinos seeking to add or upgrade their casino systems.

&#160;

The Company sells systems and technical support to casinos. The open architecture of the Table Trac system is designed to provide operators with a scalable and flexible system that can interconnect and operate with most third-party software or hardware. Key products and services forming a part of the Table Trac system include modules designed to drive player tracking programs and kiosk promotions, as well as vault and cage controls. The Company&#8217;s systems meet the strictest auditing, accounting and regulatory requirements. The Company has developed a patented, real-time system that automates and monitors the operations of casino gaming tables.
