 ITEM 1 - BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Company Background 

&#160;

WPCS was incorporated in the State of Delaware on December 18, 1997 under the name &#8220;Internet International Communications Ltd.&#8221; Pursuant to a Certificate of Amendment to the Company&#8217;s Certificate of Incorporation filed on December 23, 2004, the name of the Company was changed to WPCS International Incorporated.

&#160;

Up until September 2015, the Company had been operating in the United States and the People&#8217;s Republic of China (the &#8220;PRC&#8221;), and until September 2013 the Company also operated in Australia through the above-mentioned wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries.

&#160;

During the last two years the Company has completed a series of divestitures including The Pride Group (QLD) Pty Ltd. (&#8220;Pride&#8221;), BTX Trader, LLC (&#8220;BTX&#8221;), WPCS Asia Limited, a 60% joint venture interest in Tai'an AGS Pipeline Construction Co. Ltd. (the &#8220;China Operations&#8221;), as well as the various transactions involving the sale of substantially all of the assets of each of WPCS International - Seattle, Inc. (&#8220;Seattle Operations&#8221;), and WPCS International - Portland, Inc. (&#8220;Portland Operations&#8221;). The results of these subsidiaries, are included as part of discontinued operations for the years ended April 30, 2016 and 2015.

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Following the series of divestitures described above, the Company&#8217;s sole remaining U.S. subsidiaries are the Suisun City Operations and Texas Operations. The Company has therefore now positioned itself to be a full-service low voltage contractor that specializes in the installation and service of Voice &#38; Data Networks, Security Systems, Audio-Visual Solutions, and Distributed Antenna Systems and provides experienced project management and delivers complex projects to key vertical markets that include Healthcare, Education, Transportation, Energy &#38; Utilities, Oil &#38; Gas, Manufacturing, Commercial Real Estate, Financial, Government, etc. 

&#160;

The Company also has formed strategic alliances with technology partners to provide consulting and application software development services for collaboration, visualization and unified communications and is aligned with major manufacturers to provide the products and technology for seamless integrated and enhanced user experience for enterprise solutions.

&#160;

In addition, from the period of September 30, 2014 through July 20, 2015 the Company completed a series of financing transactions that eliminated all of its convertible and promissory note obligations and settled claims with two unsecured creditors. The results of these transactions served to strengthen the Company&#8217;s balance sheet and to allow it to execute its ongoing plan, which continues to be to increase revenue, profit and cash flow at our Suisun City Operations and Texas Operations by developing new organic growth opportunities for the Company and seeking viable acquisition and/or merger candidate(s). A summary of those transactions is as follows:

&#160;

&#160;

Series H-1 Preferred Stock 

&#160;

Between July 14 and July 20, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Securities Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with four investors pursuant to which the Company issued to the Investors an aggregate of 8,532 shares of Series H-1 Preferred Convertible Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (&#8220;Series H-1 Shares&#8221;), and warrants to purchase 1,279,759 shares of common stock of the Company, with an exercise price of between $1.63 and $1.66 per share (the &#8220;Warrants&#8221;).

&#160;

Zurich 

&#160;

On July 12, 2012, we executed the Surety Financing and Confession of Judgment Agreement (the &#8220;Financing Agreement&#8221;) with Zurich American Insurance Company (&#8220;Zurich&#8221;), to assist in the completion of the project contract with the Camden County Improvement Authority (the &#8220;CCIA&#8221;) for work at the Cooper Medical Center of Rowan University (the &#8220;Cooper Project&#8221;).

&#160;

On April 17, 2013, we executed the Surety Forbearance and Confession of Judgment Agreement (the &#8220;Forbearance Agreement&#8221;) with Zurich, which superseded the Financing Agreement. Subsequently, we defaulted on the Forbearance agreement.

&#160;

On February 20, 2015, the Company entered into a Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement (the &#8220;Settlement&#8221;) with Zurich which provided for the payment to Zurich by the Company of $650,000 to settle the Company&#8217;s outstanding balance of approximately $1,850,000 then in default, and which was previously due in full on December 31, 2013 under the existing Forbearance Agreement with Zurich.

As of April 30, 2016, the remaining balance of the Settlement was paid in full.

&#160;

As a result of the full settlement above, Zurich has agreed to release all of its entire right, title and interest in and to the Cooper Project, against which the Company filed an action to recover approximately $2,400,000 from the CCIA. The Company has recently entered into a global settlement agreement with the CCIA and in July 2016, received $1,150,000 in full satisfaction of its claims (see Note 15 &#8211; Subsequent Events).

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Industry Background 

&#160;

We focus primarily on markets such as, public service, healthcare, energy and education markets, which continue to show excellent growth potential.

&#160; 

Public Services 

&#160;

We provide communications infrastructure for public services, which includes utilities, education, military and transportation infrastructure. We believe there is an active market for communications infrastructure in the public service sector due to the need to create cost efficiencies through the implementation of new communications technology.

&#160; 

Healthcare 

&#160;

We provide communications infrastructure for hospitals and medical centers. In the healthcare market, the aging population is resulting in demands for upgraded and additional hospital infrastructure. New construction and renovations are occurring for hospitals domestically and internationally. In addition, there is a need to reduce the cost of delivering healthcare by implementing new communications technology. Our services include electrical power, structured cabling, security systems, life safety systems, environmental controls and communication systems.

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Energy 

&#160;

We provide communications infrastructure for petrochemical, natural gas and electric utility companies. The need to deliver basic energy more efficiently is driving the growth in energy construction. This creates opportunities to upgrade and deploy new communications technology.

&#160; 

Education 

&#160; 

We provide communication infrastructure for the education market. Many schools are upgrading technology backbone and wireless communications.

&#160; 

Strategy 

&#160;

We currently offer our low voltage communications, security and audio-visual infrastructure contracting services to the public services, healthcare, energy, education and corporate enterprise markets. These services are offered through our Suisun and Texas Operations. We provide an integrated approach to project coordination that creates cost-effective solutions. Corporations, government entities, healthcare organizations and educational institutions depend on the reliability and accuracy of voice, data and video communications. However, the potential for this new technology cannot be realized without the right infrastructure to support the convergence of technology. In this regard, we create integrated building systems, including the installation of advanced structured cabling systems. We specialize in wireless technology or combination of various technologies to develop a cost effective network for a customer's wireless communication requirements. This includes Wi-Fi networks, point-to-point systems, cellular networks, in-building systems and two-way communication systems. We support the integration of telecommunications, life safety, security and HVAC in an environmentally safe manner and design for future growth by building in additional capacity for expansion as new capabilities are added.

&#160;

During the past two fiscal years, our strategy in the contracting services segment has also included divesting certain operations through the sale of the Pride Operations, the sale of the assets of the Seattle Operation, and closing the unprofitable Trenton Operations. In 2014, we also sold BTX. Furthermore, in September 2015, we sold our 60% majority ownership interest in our China Operations in an all-cash transaction, for a price of $1,500,000.

&#160;

We have adopted this strategy in order to eliminate unprofitable operations and to generate cash, while we evaluate a number of opportunities including, but not limited to increasing profits and cash flow at our Suisun City Operations, seeking expansion capital and/or finding viable acquisition or merger candidates.

&#160; 

Project Characteristics 

&#160;

Our contracts are primarily service-based projects providing installation and engineering services, which include providing labor, materials and equipment for a complete installation. The projects are staffed with a project manager who manages multiple projects and a field supervisor who is responsible for an individual project. A project may also include subcontracted services along with our direct labor. The project manager coordinates the daily activities of direct labor and subcontractors and works closely with our field supervisors. Project managers are responsible for job costing, change order tracking, billing, and customer relations. Executive management monitors the performance of all projects regularly through work-in-progress reporting or percentage-of-completion, and reviews this information with each project manager. Our projects are primarily executed on a contract basis. These contracts can be awarded through a competitive bidding process, an informal bidding process, or a simple quote request. Upon award of a contract, there can be delays of several months before work begins. The active work time on our projects can range in duration from a few days up to as long as two years.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We have dedicated sales and marketing resources that develop opportunities within our existing customer base, and identify new customers through our strategic market focus and our relationships with technology providers. When an opportunity is identified, we assess the opportunity to determine our level of interest in participation. After qualifying an opportunity, our sales and marketing resources work with the estimating teams to prepare a cost estimate and contract proposal for a particular project. We keep track of bids submitted and bids that are awarded. Once a bid is awarded to us, it is assigned to a project management team and included in our backlog. In addition to its bidding work, the Company has recently hired a sales team to identify and secure direct business opportunities.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

We face competition from numerous service organizations, ranging from small independent regional firms to larger firms servicing national markets. Historically, there have been relatively few significant barriers to entry into the markets in which we operate, and, as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise and product line may become a competitor. The principal competitive advantage in these markets is establishing a reputation of delivering projects on time and within budget. Other factors of importance include accountability, certifications, project management expertise, industry experience and financial strength. We believe that the ability to provide comprehensive turnkey low voltage communications infrastructure, security, video and audio-visual package gives us a competitive advantage. In addition, we offer union workforce that allow us to bid on major union projects in San Francisco and the entire Bay Area, creating yet another competitive advantage.

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160;

We serve a variety of public services, healthcare, energy, education and corporate enterprise customers. For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2016 there were four (4) major customers who provided over 36% of our revenue.
