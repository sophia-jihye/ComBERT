 Item 1. Business Overview 

&#160; 

We are a business application, technology and consulting company providing strategies and solutions to meet our clients&#8217; information, technology and business management needs. Our services and technologies enable customers to manage, protect and monetize their enterprise assets whether on-premise or in the &#8220;Cloud&#8221;. As a value added reseller of business application software, we offer solutions for accounting and business management, financial reporting, Enterprise Resource Planning (&#8220;ERP&#8221;), Warehouse Management Systems (&#8220;WMS&#8221;), Customer Relationship Management (&#8220;CRM&#8221;), and Business Intelligence (&#8220;BI&#8221;). Additionally, we have our own development staff building software solutions for Electronic Data Interchange (&#8220;EDI&#8221;), time and billing, and various ERP enhancements. Our value-added services focus on consulting and professional services, specialized programming, training, and technical support. We have a dedicated network services practice that provides managed services, hosting, business continuity, cloud, email and web services. Our customers are nationwide, with concentrations in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area, Chicago, Dallas, Arizona, Southern California, North Carolina and Washington. 

&#160; 

Our core business is divided into the following practice areas: 

&#160; 

ERP (Enterprise Resource Management) and Accounting Software 

&#160; 

We are a value-added reseller for a number of industry-leading ERP applications. We are a Sage Software Authorized Business Partner and Sage Certified Gold Development Partner. We believe we are among the largest Sage ERP X3 partners in North America, with a sales and implementation presence complemented by a scalable software development practice for customizations and enhancements. Due to the growing demand for true cloud-based ERP solutions, we have added two (2) industry leading applications to our ERP portfolio: (1) NetSuite ERP, among the world&#8217;s leading cloud ERP solutions; and (2) Acumatica, a browser-based ERP solution that can be offered on premise, in the public cloud, or in a private cloud. We develop and resell a variety of add-on solutions to all our ERP and accounting packages that help customize the installation to our customers&#8217; needs and streamline their operations. 

&#160; 

Value-Added Services for ERP 

&#160; 

We go beyond simply reselling software packages; we have a consulting and professional services organization that manages the process as we move from the sales stage into implementation, go live, and production. We work inside our customers&#8217; organizations to ensure all software and Information Technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) solutions are enhancing their business needs. A significant portion of our services revenue comes from continuing to work with existing customers as their business needs change, upgrading from one version of software to another, or providing additional software solutions to help them grow their revenue. We have a dedicated help desk team that fields hundreds of calls every week. Our custom programming department builds specialized software packages as well as &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; enhancements and time and billing software. 

&#160; 

EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) Software and Services 

&#160; 

EDI is the computer to computer exchange of standard business documents, such as purchase orders and invoices, in electronic format. A standard file format is established for each kind of document in order to facilitate the exchange of data across a variety of platforms and programs. We have a proprietary software solution, MAPADOC, which is fully integrated with the Sage ERPs. MAPADOC allows businesses to dramatically cut data entry time by eliminating duplicate entries and reduces costly errors with trading partners. MAPADOC is the only EDI solution that is built within the framework of the Sage ERPs, allowing customers to stay within one application to get their job done. 

&#160; 

Network and Managed Services 

&#160; 

We provide comprehensive network and managed services designed to eliminate the IT concerns of our customers. Businesses can focus on their core strengths rather than technology issues. We adapt our solutions for virtually any type of business, from large national and international product and service providers, to small businesses with local customers. Our business continuity services provide automatic on and off site backups, complete encryption, and automatic failure testing. We also provide email and web security, IT consulting, managed network, and emergency IT services. Our focus in the network and managed services practice is to focus on industry verticals in order to demonstrate our ability to better understand our customers&#8217; needs. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Industry Overview 

&#160; 

As a value added reseller of business application software, we offer solutions for accounting and business management, financial reporting, managed services, ERP, WMS, CRM, and BI. Additionally, we have our own development staff building software solutions for EDI, time and billing, and various ERP enhancements. Our value-added services focus on consulting and professional services, specialized programming, training, and technical support. The majority of our customers are small and medium businesses (&#8220;SMBs&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Potential Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Independent Software Vendor .&#8195;As an independent software vendor we have published integrations between ERPs and third party products which differentiates us from other business application providers because, as a value-added reseller of the ERPs that our proprietary products integrate with, we have specific software solution expertise in the ERPs we resell, which affords us the opportunity to ensure that our proprietary products tightly integrate with the ERPs. We own the intellectual property related to these integrations, and sell the solutions both directly and through other software resellers within the Sage network. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Sage Certified Gold Development Partner .&#8195;As a Sage Certified Gold Development Partner, we are licensed to customize the source code of the Sage ERPs. Very few resellers are master developers, and in fact, we provide custom programming services for many other resellers. We have full-time programmers on staff, which provides us with a depth and breadth of expertise that we believe very few competitors can match. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Experienced Leadership . &#8195; We have a senior management team which in the aggregate has greater than 60 years of experience across a broad range of disciplines. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Ability to Recruit, Manage and Retain Quality Personnel .&#8195;We have a track record of recruiting, managing and retaining skilled labor and our ability to do so represents an important advantage in an industry in which a shortage of skilled labor is often a key limitation for both clients and competitors alike. We recruit skilled labor from competitors and from amongst end users with experience using the various products we sell, whom we then train as consultants. We believe our ability to hire, manage and maintain skilled labor gives an edge over our competitors as we continue to grow. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Combination of Hardware/Software Expertise .&#8195;Many competitors have software solution expertise. Others have network/hardware expertise. We believe we are among the very few organizations with an expertise in both software and hardware, affording us the opportunity to provide turnkey solutions for our customers without the need to bring in additional vendors on a project. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Technical Expertise .&#8195;Our geographical reach and substantial technical capabilities afford our clients the ability to customize and tailor solutions to satisfy all of their business needs. 

&#160; 

Our Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to grow our business through a combination of intra-company growth of our software applications, technology solutions and managed services, as well as expansion through acquisitions, both within our existing geographic reach and through geographic expansion. We have established a national presence via our internal marketing, sales programs, and acquisitions and now have ERP customers and MAPADOC customers throughout most of the United States. 

&#160;

Intra-Company Growth 

&#160; 

Our intra-company growth strategy is to increase our market penetration and client retention through the upgrade of, and expanded sales efforts with, our existing products and managed services and development of new and enhanced software and technology solutions. Our client retention is sustained by our providing responsive, ongoing software and technical support and monitoring and maintenance services for both the solutions we sell and other client technology needs we provide. 

&#160; 

Repeat business from our existing customer base has been key to our success and we expect it will continue to play a vital role in our growth. We focus on nurturing long-standing relationships with existing customers while also establishing relationships with new customers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Acquisitions 

&#160; 

The markets in which we provide our services are occupied by a large number of competitors, many substantially larger than us, and with significantly greater resources and geographic reach. We believe that to remain competitive, we need to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that arise which may help us achieve greater geographic presence and economies both within our existing footprint and expanded territories. As such, we have completed ten (10) acquisitions and/or collaborative agreements in the past forty-eight (48) months. We may also utilize acquisitions, whenever appropriate, to expand our technological capabilities and product offerings. We focus on acquisitions that are profitable and fit seamlessly with our existing operations. 

&#160; 

We believe our markets contain a number of attractive acquisition candidates. We foresee expanding through acquisitions of one or more of the following types of software and technology organizations: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; Managed Service Providers (&#8220;MSPs&#8221;) .&#8195;MSPs provide their small and medium-sized business clients with a suite of services, which may include 24/7/365 remote monitoring of networks, disaster recovery, business continuity, data back-up, cyber-security and the like. There are hundreds of providers of such services in the U.S., most with annual recurring revenue of less than $10 million. We believe that we may be able to consolidate a number of these MSPs with our existing operation in an effort to become one of the more significant providers of these services in the U.S. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; Independent Software Vendors (&#8220;ISVs&#8221;) .&#8195;ISVs are publishers of both stand-alone software solutions and integrations that integrate with other third party products. Our interest lies with ISVs selling into the small and medium-sized business marketplace, providing applications addressing e-commerce, mobility, security, and other functionalities. Since we have expertise in both selling directly to end-users and selling through a sales channel, we believe we can significantly enhance the sales volume of any potential acquisition via our existing infrastructure, our sales channel, and our internal marketing programs. There are many ISVs in North America, constituting a large and significant target base for our acquisition efforts. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; Value-Added Resellers (&#8220;VARs&#8221;) of ERP, Warehouse Management Systems (&#8220;WMS&#8221;), CRM and BI Software .&#8195;Of the hundreds of VARs in the Sage Software sales channel, we believe we are among the ten largest based on our 2015 revenue. VARs gross margins are a function of the sales volume they provide a publisher in a twelve (12) month period, and we are currently operating at the highest margins. Smaller resellers, who sell less and operate at significantly lower margins, are at a competitive disadvantage to companies such as ours, and are often amenable to creating a liquidity event for themselves by selling to larger organizations. This dynamic has enabled us to complete ten (10) acquisitions and/or collaborative agreements in the past forty-eight (48) months. We have benefitted from completing such acquisitions in a number of ways, including but not limited to: (i) garnering new customers to whom we can upsell and cross-sell our broad range of products and services; (ii) gaining technical resources that enhance our capabilities; and (iii) extending our geographic reach. 

&#160; 

Our business strategy provides that we will examine the potential acquisition of businesses within our industry. In determining a suitable acquisition candidate, we will carefully analyze a target&#8217;s potential to add to and complement our product mix, expand our existing revenue base, improve our margins, expand our geographic coverage, strengthen our management team, add technical resources and expertise, and, above all, improve stockholder returns. More specifically, we have identified the criteria listed below, by which we evaluate potential acquisition targets in an effort to gain the synergies necessary for successful growth of the Company: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; Access to new customers and geographic markets; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; Recurring revenue of the target; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; Opportunity to gain operating leverage and increased profit margins; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; Diversification of sales by customer and/or product; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; Improvements in product/service offerings; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; Ability to attract public capital and increased investor interest. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We are unable to predict the nature, size or timing of any acquisition. We can give no assurance that we will reach agreement or procure the financial resources necessary to fund any acquisition, or that we will be able to successfully integrate or improve returns as a result of any such acquisition. 

&#160; 

We continue to seek out and hold preliminary discussions with various acquisition candidates. However, currently we have not entered into any agreements or understandings for any acquisitions that management deems material. 

&#160; 

Electronic Data Interchange Software Strategy 

&#160; 

Our strategy for our proprietary EDI software, including specifically &#8220;MAPADOC&#8221; is to continue to achieve market penetration with new customers within our existing and expanding footprint and increase sales of new modules and enhanced functionality to our existing customer base. To remain competitive, we must periodically upgrade our software to the platform most commonly requested by the market. We must also continue our focus on enhancing applications through the addition of new functionality. Towards that end, we are exploring the development of a cloud offering or Software-as-a-Service model for MAPADOC. 

&#160; 

Enterprise Resource Planning Software Strategy 

&#160; 

Our ERP software strategy is focused on serving the needs of our expansive installed base of customers for our Sage 100 ERP, Sage 500 ERP, and Sage BusinessWorks practices, while rapidly growing the number of customers using Sage ERP X3, NetSuite, and Acumatica. We currently have approximately 2,300 active ERP customers using one of these six solutions, including customers using certain add-on support products to these solutions. In the past we, have focused primarily on on-premise mid-market Sage Software solutions but in the past three years have shifted our focus to the more enterprise-level Sage ERP X3 offering, as well as diversifying into cloud ERP solutions. This has allowed us to increase our average deal size significantly and also keep pace with the changing trends that we see in the industry. 

&#160; 

Managed Services Strategy 

&#160; 

The Managed Services market is broadly segmented by types of services as such, for example managed data-center, managed network, managed mobility, managed infrastructure, managed communications, managed information, managed security and other managed services. In addition, the market is segmented by market verticals, such as public sector, banking, financial services and insurance, education, retail, contact centers and service industries, high tech and telecommunications, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, travel and logistics, manufacturing, energy and utilities among others. 

&#160; 

The recent trend in the industry shows that there is a high demand for managed services across every industry vertical. The implementation of managed services reduces IT costs by 30% to 40% in such enterprises. This enables organizations to have flexibility and technical advantage. Enterprises having their services outsourced look forward to risk sharing and to reduce their IT costs and IT commitments, so that they are able to concentrate on their core competencies. Organizations implementing managed services have reported almost a 50% to 60% increase in the operational efficiency of their outsourced processes. Enterprises have accepted outsourcing services as a means to enable them to reduce their capital expenditure (CapEx) and free up internal sources. Newer managed services that penetrate almost all the industry domains, along with aggressive pricing in services, are being offered. This results in an increase in the overall revenues of the managed services market. It is observed that there is an increase in outsourcing of wireless, communications, mobility and other value-added services, such as content and e-commerce facilities. With increasing technological advancements and the cost challenges associated with having the IT services in-house, we believe the future seems optimistic for managed services providers. 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to continue to expand our product offerings to the small and medium sized business marketplace, and to increase our scale and capabilities via acquisition throughout the United States, but initially in those regions where we currently have existing offices. 

&#160; 

Geographic Expansion 

&#160; 

Generally, our technology offerings require on-premise implementation and support. When we expand into new geographic territories, we prefer to find qualified personnel in an area to augment our current staff of consultants to service our business. The need for hands-on implementation and support may also require investment in additional physical offices and other overhead. We believe our approach is conservative. 

&#160; 

We may accelerate expansion if we find complementary businesses that we are able to acquire in other regions. Our marketing efforts to expand into new territories have included attendance at trade shows in addition to personal contact. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Products and Services 

&#160; 

Enterprise Resource Planning Software 

&#160; 

Substantially all of our initial sales of ERP financial accounting solutions consist of pre-packaged software and associated services to customers in the United States. 

&#160; 

The Company resells ERP software published by Sage Software and other providers for the financial accounting requirements of small- and medium-sized businesses focused on manufacturing and distribution, and the delivery of related services from the sales of these products, including installation, support and training. The programs perform and support a wide variety of functions related to accounting, including financial reporting, accounts payable and accounts receivable, and inventory management. 

&#160; 

We provide a variety of services along with our financial accounting software sales to assist our customers in maximizing the benefits from these software applications. These services include training, technical support, and professional services. We employ class instructors and have formal, specific training in the topics they are teaching. We can also provide on-site training services that are highly tailored to meet the needs of a particular customer. Our instructors must pass annual subject-matter examinations required by Sage to retain their product-based teaching certifications. 

&#160; 

We provide end-user technical support services through our support/help desk. Our product and technology consultants assist customers calling with questions about product features, functions, usability issues, and configurations. The support/help desk offers services in a variety of ways, including prepaid services, time and materials billed as utilized and annual support contracts. Customers can communicate with the support/help desk through e-mail, telephone, and fax channels. Standard support/help desk services are offered during normal business hours five (5) days per week. 

&#160; 

Electronic Data Interchange Software 

&#160; 

We publish our own proprietary EDI software, &#8220;MAPADOC.&#8221; EDI can be used to automate existing processes, to rationalize procedures and reduce costs, and to improve the speed and quality of services. Because EDI necessarily involves business partners, it can be used as a catalyst for gaining efficiencies across organizational boundaries. 

&#160; 

Our &#8220;MAPADOC&#8221; EDI solution is a fully integrated EDI solution that provides users of Sage Software&#8217;s market-leading Sage 100 ERP/Sage 500 ERP/Sage ERP X3 software products with a feature rich product that is easy to use. &#8220;MAPADOC&#8221; provides the user with dramatically decreased data entry time, elimination of redundant steps, the lowering of paper and postage costs, the reduction of time spent typing, signing, checking and approving documents and the ability to self-manage EDI and to provide a level of independence that saves time and money. 

&#160; 

We market our &#8220;MAPADOC&#8221; solutions to our existing and new small and medium-sized business customers, and through a network of resellers. We have a sales team of technical specialists involved in marketing and supporting sales of the &#8220;MAPADOC&#8221; product and associated services . 

&#160; 

Warehouse Management Systems 

&#160; 

We are resellers of the Accellos Warehouse Management System software published by High Jump, Inc. (&#8220;High Jump&#8221;). High Jump develops warehouse management software for mid-market distributors. The primary purpose of a WMS is to control the movement and storage of materials within an operation and process the associated transactions. Directed picking, directed replenishment, and directed put-away are the key to WMS. The detailed setup and processing within a WMS can vary significantly from one software vendor to another. However, the basic WMS will use a combination of item, location, quantity, unit of measure, and order information to determine where to stock, where to pick, and in what sequence to perform these operations. 

&#160; 

The Accellos WMS software improves accuracy and efficiency, streamlines materials handling, meets retail compliance requirements, and refines inventory control. Accellos also works as part of a complete operational solution by integrating seamlessly with radio frequency hardware, accounting software, shipping systems and warehouse automation equipment. 

&#160; 

We market the Accellos solution to our existing and new medium-sized business customers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Managed Network Services and Business Consulting 

&#160; 

We provide managed services, data back-up, network maintenance and service upgrades for our business clients. We are a Microsoft Solutions Provider. Our staff includes engineers who maintain certifications from Microsoft and Sage Software. They are Microsoft Certified Systems Engineers and Microsoft Certified Professionals, and they provide a host of services for our clients, including remote network monitoring, server implementation, support and assistance, operation and maintenance of large central systems, technical design of network infrastructure, technical troubleshooting for large scale problems, network and server security, and backup, archiving, and storage of data from servers. There are numerous competitors, both larger and smaller, nationally and locally, with whom we compete in this market. 

&#160; 

Product Development 

&#160; 

We are continually looking to improve and develop new products. Our product initiatives include various new product offerings, which are either extensions of existing products or newly conceptualized product offerings including, but not limited to: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; Time and Billing Exact (TBX) 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; SPS RSX Connector 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; MAPADOC Express 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; Fusion X3 Integration 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; Accellos X3 Integration 

&#160; 

We are using a dual-shore development approach to keep product development costs at a minimum. All of our product development is led by U.S. based employees. The project leaders are technical resources who are involved in developing technical specifications, design decisions, usability testing, and transferring the project knowledge to our offshore development team. Several times per week, the product development leadership team meets with our project leaders and development teams to discuss project status, development obstacles, and project timelines. 

&#160; 

Arrangements with Principal Suppliers 

&#160; 

Our revenues are primarily derived from the resale of vendor software products and services. These resales are made pursuant to channel sales agreements whereby we are granted authority to purchase and resell the vendor products and services. Under these agreements, we either resell software directly to our customers or act as a sales agent for various vendors and receive commissions for our sales efforts. 

&#160; 

We are required to enter into an annual Channel Partner Agreement with Sage Software whereby Sage Software appoints us as a non-exclusive partner to market, distribute, and support Sage 100 ERP, Sage 500 ERP and Sage ERP X3. The Channel Partner Agreement is for a one-year term, and automatically renews for an additional one-year term on the anniversary of the agreement&#8217;s effective date. These agreements authorize us to sell these software products to customers in the United States. There are no clauses in this agreement that limit or restrict the services that we can offer to customers. We also operate a Sage Software Authorized Training Center Agreement and also are party to a Master Developers Program License Agreement. 

&#160; 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, purchases from Sage Software were approximately 24% and 26%, respectively, of the Company&#8217;s total cost of revenue. Generally, the Company does not rely on any one specific supplier for all of its purchases and maintains relationships with other suppliers that could replace its existing supplier should the need arise. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

We market our products throughout North America. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our top ten (10) customers accounted for 19% ($5,179,085) and 16% ($3,381,090), respectively, of our total revenues. Generally, we do not rely on any one specific customer for any significant portion of our revenue base. No single customer accounted for ten percent or more of our consolidated revenues base. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We regard our technology and other proprietary rights as essential to our business. We rely on copyright, trade secret, confidentiality procedures, contract provisions, and trademark law to protect our technology and intellectual property. We have also entered into confidentiality agreements with our consultants and corporate partners and intend to control access to, and distribution of our products, documentation, and other proprietary information. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We own two trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for &#8220;MAPADOC&#8221; and have two (2) trademark applications pending. We have no patents or patent applications pending. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our markets are highly fragmented and the business is characterized by a large number of participants, including several large companies, as well significant number of small, privately-held, local competitors. A significant portion of our revenue is currently derived from requests for proposals (RFPs&#8221;) and price is often an important factor in awarding such agreements. Accordingly, our competitors may underbid us if they elect to price their services aggressively to procure such business. Our competitors may also develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services, and we may not be able to enhance our competitive position. The principal competitive factors for our professional services include geographic presence, breadth of service offerings, technical skills, quality of service and industry reputation. We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 30, 2016, we had approximately 139 full time employees with 32 of our employees engaged in sales and marketing activities, 82 employees are engaged in service fulfillment, and 25 employees employed in administrative activities. 

&#160; 

Our future success depends in significant part upon the continued services of our key sales, technical, and senior management personnel and our ability to attract and retain highly qualified sales, technical, and managerial personnel. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage. 

&#160; 

Legal Proceedings 

&#160; 

We are not currently involved in any litigation that we believe could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our Company or our subsidiary, threatened against or affecting us, our Common Stock, our subsidiary or of our subsidiary&#8217; officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect. 

&#160; 

Our Corporate History 

&#160; 

We were incorporated on October 3, 2002, as a wholly owned subsidiary of iVoice, Inc. (&#8220;iVoice&#8221;). On February 11, 2004, the Company was spun off from iVoice and became an independent publicly traded company. On September 5, 2003, we changed our corporate name to Trey Resources, Inc. In March 2004, Trey Resources, Inc. began trading on the OTCBB under the symbol TYRIA.OB. In June 2011, we changed our name to SilverSun Technologies, Inc., trading under the symbol SSNT. 

&#160; 

Prior to June 2004, we were engaged in the design, manufacture, and marketing of specialized telecommunication equipment. On June 2, 2004, our wholly-owned subsidiary, SWK Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;SWK&#8221;) completed its acquisition of SWK, Inc. Since the acquisition of SWK, Inc. we have focused on three (3) core business sectors, including acting as the following: (i) a managed service provider for computer networks, providing 24/7 remote monitoring of networks, data backup, hosting, and business continuity and disaster recovery services; (ii) a value added reseller and master developer for Sage Software&#8217;s Sage 100 ERP, Sage 500 ERP and Sage ERP X3 enterprise resource planning (&#8220;ERP&#8221;) financial software; and (iii) publisher of its own proprietary software solutions and integrations, including its Electronic Data Interchange (&#8220;EDI&#8221;) software, &#8220;MAPADOC.&#8221; We also publish twenty (20) other assorted software solutions. We focus on the business application software and the information technology consulting market for small and medium-sized businesses (&#8220;SMB&#8217;s&#8221;), selling services and products to various end users, manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors located throughout the United States. 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to grow our business through a combination of intra-company growth of our software applications and technology solutions, as well as expansion through acquisitions, both within our existing geographic reach and through geographic expansion. To that end, since 2006, we have completed a number of acquisitions that have increased our client base, technical expertise and geographic footprint. 

&#160; 

On June 2, 2006, SWK completed the acquisition of certain assets of AMP-Best Consulting, Inc. (&#8220;AMP&#8221;) of Syracuse, New York. AMP is an information technology company and value added reseller of licensed ERP software published by Sage Software. AMP sold services and products to various end users, manufacturers, wholesalers and distribution industry clients located throughout the United States, with special emphasis on companies located in the upstate New York region. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

During 2011, SWK acquired Sage&#8217;s Software&#8217;s customer accounts in connection with IncorTech, LLC (&#8220;IncorTech&#8221;), a Southern California-based Sage business partner. This transaction increased our geographical influence in Southern California for the sale and support of our MAPADOC integrated EDI solution and the marketing of our Sage ERP X3 to both former IncorTech customers as well as new consumers. IncorTech had previously provided professional accounting, technology, and business consulting services to over 300 clients. 

&#160;

In June 2012, SWK acquired selected assets and obligations of Hightower, Inc., a Chicago-based reseller of Sage software applications. In addition to the strategic geographic benefits that this acquisition brings to SWK, there is also a substantial suite of proprietary enhancement software solutions.
