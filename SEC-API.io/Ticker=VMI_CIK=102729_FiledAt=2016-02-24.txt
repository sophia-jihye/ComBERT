 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

(a) 

General Description of Business 

General 

We are a diversified global producer of fabricated metal products and are a leading producer of steel, aluminum and composite pole, tower and other structures in our Engineered Support Structures (ESS) segment, steel and concrete pole structures in our Utilities Support Structures (Utility) segment and are a global producer of mechanized irrigation systems in our Irrigation segment. Within our Energy and Mining segment, we manufacture industrial access systems, grinding media used in mining operations, and complex steel structures used in wind energy and utility transmission applications outside the United States. We also provide metal coating services, including galvanizing, painting and anodizing in our Coatings segment. Our products sold through the ESS segment include outdoor lighting, traffic control, and roadway safety structures, wireless communication structures and components. Our pole structures sold through our Utility segment support electrical transmission and distribution lines and related power distribution equipment. Our Irrigation segment produces mechanized irrigation equipment that delivers water, chemical fertilizers and pesticides to agricultural crops. Customers and end-users of our products include state and federal governments, contractors, utility and telecommunications companies, manufacturers of commercial lighting fixtures and large farms as well as the general manufacturing sector. In 2015, approximately 37% of our total sales were either sold in markets or produced by our manufacturing plants outside of North America. We were founded in 1946, went public in 1968 and our shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker: VMI). 

Business Strategy 

Our strategy is to pursue growth opportunities that leverage our existing product portfolio, knowledge of our principal end-markets and customers and engineering capability to increase our sales, earnings and cash flow, including: 

Increasing the Market Penetration of our Existing Products. &#32;&#32;Our strategy is to increase our market penetration by differentiating our products from our competitors&#8217; products through superior customer service, technological innovation and consistent high quality. For example, our Utility segment increased its sales between 2010 and 2013 through our engineering capability, effective coordination of our production capacity and strong customer service to meet our customers&#8217; requirements, especially on large, complex projects. 

Bringing our Existing Products to New Markets. &#32;&#32;Our strategy is to expand the sales of our existing products into geographic areas where we do not currently have a strong presence as well as into applications for which end-users do not currently purchase our type of product. In recent years, our Utility business successfully expanded into new markets in Africa. We have also expanded our geographic presence in Europe and North Africa for lighting structures. We have also been successful introducing our pole products to utility and wireless communication applications where customers have traditionally purchased lattice tower products. Our strategy of building manufacturing presences in China and India was based primarily on expanding our offering of pole structures for lighting, utility and wireless communication to these markets. Our Irrigation segment has a long history of developing new mechanized irrigation markets in emerging markets. In recent years, these markets include China and Eastern Europe. Our 2015 acquisition of American Galvanizing provides us with a presence in the Northeast U.S. galvanizing market. 

&#32; Developing New Products for Markets that We Currently Serve. &#32;&#32;Our strategy is to grow by developing new products for markets where we have a comprehensive understanding of end-user requirements and longstanding relationships with key distributors and end-users. For example, in recent years we developed and sold structures for tramway applications in Europe. The customers for this product line include many of the state and local governments that purchase our lighting structures. Another example is the development and expansion of decorative product concepts for lighting applications that have been introduced to our existing customer base. Our 2014 acquisition of the majority ownership in AgSense allows us to offer expanded remote monitoring services over irrigation equipment and other aspects of a farming operation. 

Developing New Products for New Markets and Leverage a Core Competency to Further Diversify our Business. &#32;&#32;Our strategy is to increase our sales and diversify our business by developing new products for new markets or to leverage a core competency. For example, we have been expanding our offering of specialized decorative lighting poles in the U.S. including the fiberglass composite structures offered through Shakespeare Composite Structures which we acquired in 2014. 

The decorative lighting market has different customers than our traditional markets and the products to serve that market are different than the poles we manufacture for the transportation and commercial markets. The acquisition of Delta in 2010 gave us a presence in highway safety systems and industrial access systems, products that we believe are complementary to our existing products and provide us with future growth opportunities. The establishment and growth of our Coatings segment was based on using our expertise in galvanizing to develop what is now a global business segment. 

Acquisitions 

We have grown internally and by acquisition. Our significant business expansions during the past five years include the following (including the segment where the business reports): 

&#8226; 

Acquisition of Delta plc, a publicly-traded company headquartered in the United Kingdom that manufactures and distributes steel engineered products, provides galvanizing services and manufactures steel forged grinding media and electrolytic manganese dioxide (ESS, Energy &#38; Mining, Coatings) 

&#8226; 

Acquisition of the remaining 40% not previously owned of Donhad Pty. Ltd., a forged steel grinding media manufacturer located in Australia (Energy &#38; Mining) 

&#8226; 

Acquisition of an irrigation monitoring services company located in Brazil (Irrigation) 

&#8226; 

Acquisition of a galvanizing business with three locations in Ontario, Canada (Coatings) 

&#8226; 

Acquisition of a manufacturer of perforated, expanded metal for the non-residential market, industrial flooring and handrails for the access systems market, and screening media for applications in the industrial and mining sectors in Australia and Asia (Energy and Mining) 

&#8226; 

Acquisition of the remaining 40% not previously owned of Valley Irrigation South Africa Pty. Ltd (Irrigation) 

&#8226; 

Acquisition of a distributor a company holding proprietary intellectual property for products serving the highway safety market located in New Zealand (ESS) 

&#8226; 

Acquisition of a manufacturer of heavy complex steel structures with two manufacturing locations in Denmark (Energy and Mining) 

&#8226; 

Acquisition of a 51% ownership stake in AgSense, which provides farmers with remote monitoring equipment for their pivots and entire farming operation (Irrigation) 

&#8226; 

Acquisition of a manufacturer of fiberglass composite support structures with two manufacturing locations in South Carolina (ESS) 

&#8226; 

Acquisition of a galvanizing business located in Hammonton, New Jersey (Coatings) 

There have been no significant divestitures of businesses in the past six years. In 2011, we exited our structures joint venture in Turkey (formed in 2008) and ceased our structures sales and distribution operation in Italy. Both of these businesses were in the ESS segment. The impact of these events on our financial statements was not material. 

(b) Segments 

In 2015, the Company changed its reportable segment structure to improve transparency. The Company now has five &#32;reportable segments and our management structure was changed to align with this new reporting structure. Each segment is global in nature with a manager responsible for segment operational performance and allocation of capital within the segment. A new reportable segment, Energy &#38; Mining, includes the businesses primarily serving the energy and mining end markets. This segment includes the access systems applications businesses and offshore structures business that was formerly part of the Engineered Infrastructure Products (EIP) segment, and the grinding media business that was formerly included in the "Other" category. The remaining businesses from the EIP segment were renamed "Engineered Support Structures". We also moved the tubing business from the "Other" category to the Irrigation segment as one of the largest markets it serves is agriculture. 

Our reportable segments are as follows: 

Engineered Support Structures: &#32;&#32;This segment consists of the manufacture and distribution of engineered metal and composite structures and components for global lighting and traffic, wireless communication, and roadway safety; 

Utility Support Structures: &#32;&#32;This segment consists of the manufacture of engineered steel and concrete structures for the global utility industry; 

Energy and Mining: This segment, all outside of the United States, consists of the manufacture of access systems applications, forged steel grinding media, on and off shore oil, gas, and wind energy structures. 

Coatings: &#32;&#32;This segment consists of galvanizing, anodizing and powder coating services on a global basis; and 

Irrigation: &#32;&#32;This segment consists of the manufacture of agricultural irrigation equipment and related parts and services for the global agricultural industry as well as tubular products for a variety of industrial customers. 

Other: &#32;&#32;In addition to these five reportable segments, we have other operations and activities that individually are not more than 10% of consolidated sales, operating income or assets. These activities include the distribution of industrial fasteners. 

Amounts of sales, operating income and total assets attributable to each segment for each of the last three years is set forth in Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements.

Narrative Description of Business 

Information concerning the principal products produced and services rendered, markets, competition and distribution methods for each of our five reportable segments is set forth below. 

Engineered Support Structures Segment 

Products Produced &#8212;We manufacture steel, aluminum, and composite poles and structures to which lighting and traffic control fixtures are attached for a wide range of outdoor lighting applications, such as streets, highways, parking lots, sports stadiums and commercial and residential developments. The demand for these products is driven by infrastructure, commercial and residential construction and by consumers&#8217; desire for well-lit streets, highways, parking lots and common areas to help make these areas safer at night and to support trends toward more active lifestyles and 24-hour convenience. In addition to safety, customers want products that are visually appealing. In Europe, we are a leader in decorative lighting poles, which are attractive as well as functional. We are leveraging this expertise to expand our decorative product sales in North America and China. Traffic poles are structures to which traffic signals are attached and aid the orderly flow of automobile traffic. While standard designs are available, poles are often engineered to customer specifications to ensure the proper function and safety of the structure. Product engineering takes into account factors such as weather (e.g. wind, ice) and the products loaded on the structure (e.g. lighting fixtures, traffic signals, overhead signs) to determine the design of the pole. This product line also includes roadway safety systems, including guard rail barrier systems, wire rope safety barriers, crash attenuation barriers and other products designed to redirect vehicles when off course and to prevent collisions between vehicles. Highway safety systems are also designed and engineered to absorb collisions and ultimately reduce roadway fatalities and injury. 

We also manufacture and distribute a broad range of structures (poles and towers) and components serving the wireless communication market. A wireless communication cell site mainly consists of a steel pole or tower, shelter (enclosure where the radio equipment is located), antennas (devices that receive and transmit data and voice information to and from wireless communication devices) and components (items that are used to mount antennas to the structure and to connect cabling and other parts from the antennas to the shelter). Structures are engineered and designed to customer specifications, which include factors such as the number of antennas on the structure and wind and soil conditions. Due to the size of these structures, design is important to ensure each structure meets performance and safety specifications. We do not provide any significant installation services on the structures we sell. 

Markets &#8212;The key markets for our lighting, traffic and roadway safety products are the transportation and commercial lighting markets and public roadway building and improvement. The transportation market includes street and 

highway lighting and traffic control, much of which is driven by government spending programs. For example, the U.S. government funds highway and road improvement through the federal highway program. This program provides funding to improve the nation&#8217;s roadway system, which includes roadway lighting and traffic control enhancements. Matching funding from the various states may be required as a condition of federal funding. The current federal highway program was renewed and extended in late 2015. In the United States, there are approximately 4 million miles of public roadways, with approximately 24% carrying over 80% of the traffic. Accordingly, the need to improve traffic flow through traffic controls and lighting is a priority for many communities. Transportation markets in other areas of the world are also heavily funded by local and national governments. The commercial lighting market is mainly funded privately and includes lighting for applications such as parking lots, shopping centers, sports stadiums and business parks. The commercial lighting market is driven by macro-economic factors such as general economic growth rates, interest rates and the commercial construction economy. 

The main markets for our communication products have been the wireless telephone carriers and build-to-suit companies (organizations that own cell sites and attach antennas from multiple carriers to the pole or tower structure). We also sell products to state and federal governments for two-way radio communication, radar, broadcasting and security applications. We believe long-term growth should mainly be driven by increased usage, technologies such as 4G (including applications for smart phones, such as streaming video and internet) and demand for improved emergency response systems, as part of the U.S. Homeland Security initiatives. Subscriber growth should continue to increase, although at a lower rate than in the past. In general, as the number of subscribers and usage of wireless communication devices increase, we believe this will result in demand for communication structures and components. 

All of the products that we manufacture in this segment are parts of customer investments in basic infrastructure. The total cost of these investments can be substantial, so access to capital is often important to fund infrastructure needs. Due to the nature of these markets, demand can be cyclical as projects sometimes can be delayed due to funding or other issues. 

Competition &#8212;Our competitive strategy in all of the markets we serve is to provide high value to the customer at a reasonable price. We compete on the basis of product quality, high levels of customer service, timely, complete and accurate delivery of the product and design capability to provide the best solutions to our customers. There are numerous competitors in our markets, most of which are relatively small companies. Companies compete on the basis of price, product quality, reliable delivery and unique product features. Pricing can be very competitive, especially when demand is weak or when strong local currencies result in increased competition from imported products. 

Distribution Methods &#8212;Sales and distribution activities are handled through a combination of a direct sales force and commissioned agents. Lighting agents represent Valmont as well as lighting fixture companies and sell other related products. Sales are typically to electrical distributors, who provide the pole, fixtures and other equipment to the end user as a complete package. Commercial lighting and highway safety sales are normally made through Valmont sales employees, who work on a salary plus incentive, although some sales are made through independent, commissioned sales agents. 

Utility Support Structures Segment 

Products Produced &#8212;We manufacture steel and concrete pole structures for electrical transmission, substation and distribution applications. Our products help move electrical power from where it is produced to where it is used. We produce tapered steel and pre-stressed concrete poles for high-voltage transmission lines, substations (which transfer high-voltage electricity to low-voltage transmission) and electrical distribution (which carry electricity from the substation to the end-user). In addition, we produce hybrid structures, which are structures with a concrete base section and steel upper sections. Utility structures can be very large, so product design engineering is important to the function and safety of the structure. Our engineering process takes into account weather and loading conditions, such as wind speeds, ice loads and the power lines attached to the structure, in order to arrive at the final design. 

Markets &#8212;Our sales in this segment are mainly in North America, where the key drivers in the utility business are significant upgrades in the electrical grid to support enhanced reliability standards, policy changes encouraging more generation from renewable energy sources, interconnection of regional grids to share more efficient generation to the benefit of the consumer and increased electrical consumption which has outpaced the transmission investment in the past decades. According to the Edison Electric Institute, the electrical transmission grid in the U.S. requires significant investment in the coming years to respond to the compelling industry drivers and lack of investment over the past 25 years. The expected increase in electrical consumption around the world should also require substantial investment in new electricity generation 

capacity which will prompt further international growth in transmission grid development. We expect these factors to result in increased demand for electrical utility structures to transport electricity from source to user. 

Competition &#8212;Our competitive strategy in this segment is to provide high value solutions to the customer at a reasonable price. We compete on the basis of product quality, engineering expertise, high levels of customer service and reliable, timely delivery of the product. There are many competitors. Companies compete on the basis of price, quality and service. Utility sales are often made through a competitive bid process, whereby the lowest bidder is awarded the contract, provided the competitor meets all other qualifying criteria. In weak markets, price is a more important criterion in the bid process. 

Distribution Methods &#8212;Products are normally sold through commissioned sales agents or sold directly to electrical utilities. 

Energy and Mining Segment 

Products Produced &#8212; We produce and distribute access systems, which are engineered structures and components that allow people to move safely and effectively in an industrial, infrastructure or commercial facility. We also produce a line of products which are used in architectural applications. Examples of these products are perforated metal sun screens and facades that can be used on building structures to improve shading and aesthetics. Products offered in this product line are usually engineered to specific customer requirements and include floor gratings, handrails, barriers and sunscreens. This segment also manufactures complex steel structures, rotor houses, crown-mounted compensators, winches, cranes and material handling equipment for offshore and land-based wind energy, oil &#38; gas, and utility transmission outside of North America. We also produce forged steel products used in the mining processing industry. 

Markets &#32;- Markets for access systems are typically driven by infrastructure, industrial and commercial construction spending and can be cyclical depending on economic conditions in the markets in which we compete. Customers consist of construction firms or installers who participate in infrastructure, industrial and commercial construction projects, natural gas and mineral exploration companies, resellers such as steel service centers, and end users. Markets for the complex steel structures are in oil and gas, wind turbine towers, and material handling systems within Europe. The market for grinding media are mines typically within Australia. 

Competition &#32;- For both access systems and grinding media, we compete on the basis of product quality and timely, complete and accurate delivery of the product. There are numerous competitors for both of these product lines. Pricing can be very competitive, especially when demand is weak or when strong local currencies result in increased competition from imported products. For offshore and complex steel structures, we compete based on our ability to co-engineer and design solutions with customers, carry out advanced order production of complex steel constructions with electronics and hydraulics and having highly automated series production for more mature products. 

Coatings Segment 

Services Rendered &#8212;We add finishes to metals that inhibit corrosion, extend service lives and enhance physical attractiveness of a wide range of materials and products. Among the services provided include: 

&#8226; 

Hot-dipped Galvanizing 

&#8226; 

Anodizing 

&#8226; 

Powder Coating 

&#8226; 

E-Coating 

In our Coatings segment, we take unfinished products from our customers and return them with a galvanized, anodized or painted finish. Galvanizing is a process that protects steel with a zinc coating that is bonded to the product surface to inhibit rust and corrosion. Anodizing is a process applied to aluminum that oxidizes the surface of the aluminum in a controlled manner, which protects the aluminum from corrosion and allows the material to be dyed a variety of colors. We also paint products using powder coating and e-coating technology (where paint is applied through an electrical charge) for a number of industries and markets. 

Markets &#8212;Markets for our products are varied and our profitability is not substantially dependent on any one industry or customer. Demand for coatings services generally follows the local industrial economies. Galvanizing is used in a wide variety of industrial applications where corrosion protection of steel is desired. While markets are varied, our markets for anodized or painted products are more directly dependent on consumer markets than industrial markets. 

Competition &#8212;The Coatings markets traditionally have been very fragmented, with a large number of competitors. Most of these competitors are relatively small, privately held companies who compete on the basis of price and personal relationships with their customers. As a result of ongoing industry consolidation, there are also several (public and private) multi-facility competitors. Our strategy is to compete on the basis of quality of the coating finish and timely delivery of the coated product to the customer. We also use the production capacity at our network of plants to ensure that the customer receives quality, timely service. 

Distribution Methods &#8212;Due to freight costs, a galvanizing location has an effective service area of an approximate 300 to 500 mile radius. While we believe that we are globally one of the largest custom galvanizers, our sales are a small percentage of the total market. Sales and customer service are provided directly to the user by a direct sales force, generally assigned to each specific location. 

Irrigation Segment 

Products Produced &#8212;We manufacture and distribute mechanical irrigation equipment and related service parts under the &#8220;Valley&#8221; brand name. A Valley irrigation machine usually is powered by electricity and propels itself over a farm field and applies water and chemicals to crops. Water and, in some instances, chemicals are applied through sprinklers attached to a pipeline that is supported by a series of towers, each of which is propelled via a drive train and tires. A standard mechanized irrigation machine (also known as a &#8220;center pivot&#8221;) rotates in a circle, although we also manufacture and distribute center pivot extensions that can irrigate corners of square and rectangular farm fields as well as conform to irregular field boundaries (referred to as a &#8220;corner&#8221; machine). Our irrigation machines can also irrigate fields by moving up and down the field as opposed to rotating in a circle (referred to as a &#8220;linear&#8221; machine). Irrigation machines can be configured to irrigate fields in size from 4 acres to over 500 acres, with a standard size in the U.S. configured for a 160-acre tract of ground. One of the key components of our irrigation machine is the control system. This is the part of the machine that allows the machine to be operated in the manner preferred by the grower, offering control of such factors as on/off timing, individual field sector control, rate and depth of water and chemical application. We also offer growers options to control multiple irrigation machines through centralized computer control or mobile remote control. The irrigation machine used in international markets is substantially the same as the one produced for the North American market. 

Other Types of Irrigation &#32;&#8212; There are other forms of irrigation available to farmers, two of the most prevalent being flood irrigation and drip irrigation. In flood irrigation, water is applied through a pipe or canal at the top of the field and allowed to run down the field by gravity. Drip irrigation involves plastic pipe or tape resting on the surface of the field or buried a few inches below ground level, with water being applied gradually. We estimate that center pivot and linear irrigation comprises 50% of the irrigated acreage in North America. International markets use predominantly flood irrigation, although all forms are used to some extent. 

The Company through its majority ownership in AgSense LLC, develops and markets remote monitoring technology for pivot irrigation systems that is sold on a subscription basis under the WagNet product name. WagNet technology allows growers to remotely monitor and operate irrigation equipment and other farm structures such as grain bins. Data management and control is achieved using applications running on either a personal computer-based internet browser or various mobile devices connected to the internet. We also manufacture tubular products for industrial customers primarily in the agriculture industry as well as in the transportation and other industries. 

Markets &#8212;Market drivers in North American and international markets are essentially the same. Since the purchase of an irrigation machine is a capital expenditure, the purchase decision is based on the expected return on investment. The benefits a grower may realize through investment in mechanical irrigation include improved yields through better irrigation, cost savings through reduced labor and lower water and energy usage. The purchase decision is also affected by current and expected net farm income, commodity prices, interest rates, the status of government support programs and water regulations in local areas. In many international markets, the relative strength or weakness of local currencies as compared with the U.S. dollar may affect net farm income, since export markets are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. 

The demand for mechanized irrigation comes from the following sources: 

&#8226; 

conversion from flood irrigation 

&#8226; 

replacement of existing mechanized irrigation machines 

&#8226; 

converting land that is not irrigated to mechanized irrigation 

One of the key drivers in our Irrigation segment worldwide is that the usable water supply is limited. We estimate that: 

&#8226; 

only 2.5% of total worldwide water supply is freshwater 

&#8226; 

of that 2.5%, only 30% of freshwater is available to humans 

&#8226; 

the largest user of that freshwater is agriculture 

We believe these factors, along with the trend of a growing worldwide population and improving diets, reflect the need to use water more efficiently while increasing food production to feed this growing population. We believe that mechanized irrigation can improve water application efficiency by 40-90% compared with traditional irrigation methods by applying water uniformly near the root zone and reducing water runoff. Furthermore, reduced water runoff improves water quality in nearby rivers, aquifers and streams, thereby providing environmental benefits in addition to conservation of water. 

Competition &#8212;In North America, there are a number of entities that provide irrigation products and services to agricultural customers. We believe we are the leader of the four main participants in the mechanized irrigation business. Participants compete for sales on the basis of price, product innovation and features, product durability and reliability, quality and service capabilities of the local dealer. Pricing can become very competitive, especially in periods when market demand is low. In international markets, our competitors are a combination of our major U.S. competitors and privately&#8209;owned local companies. Competitive factors are similar to those in North America, although pricing tends to be a more prevalent competitive strategy in international markets. Since competition in international markets is local, we believe local manufacturing capability is important to competing effectively in international markets and we have that capability in key regions. 

Distribution Methods &#8212;We market our irrigation machines and service parts through independent dealers. There are approximately 280 dealer locations in North America, with another approximately 210 dealers serving international markets. The dealer determines the grower&#8217;s requirements, designs the configuration of the machine, installs the machine (including providing ancillary products that deliver water and electrical power to the machine) and provides after&#8209;sales service. Our dealer network is supported and trained by our technical and sales teams. Our international dealers are supported through our regional headquarters in South America, South Africa, Western Europe, Australia, China and the United Arab Emirates as well as the home office in Valley, Nebraska. 

General 

Certain information generally applicable to each of our five reportable segments is set forth below. 

Suppliers and Availability of Raw Materials. 

Hot rolled steel coil and plate, zinc and other carbon steel products are the primary raw materials utilized in the manufacture of finished products for all segments. We purchase these essential items from steel mills, steel service centers, and zinc producers and these materials are usually readily available. While we may experience increased lead times to acquire materials and volatility in our purchase costs, we do not believe that key raw materials would be unavailable for extended periods. We have not experienced extended or wide-spread shortages of steel during this time, due to what we believe are strong relationships with some of the major steel producers. In the past several years, we experienced volatility in zinc and natural gas prices, but we did not experience any disruptions to our operations due to availability. 

Patents, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions. 

We have a number of patents for our manufacturing machinery, poles and irrigation designs. We also have a number of registered trademarks. We do not believe the loss of any individual patent or trademark would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

Seasonal Factors in Business. 

Sales can be somewhat seasonal based upon the agricultural growing season and the infrastructure construction season. Sales of mechanized irrigation equipment to farmers are traditionally higher during the spring and fall and lower in the summer. Sales of infrastructure products are traditionally higher summer and fall and lower in the winter. 

Customers. 

We are not dependent for a material part of any segment&#8217;s business upon a single customer or upon very few customers. The loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

Backlog. 

The backlog of orders for the principal products manufactured and marketed was $590.4 million at the end of the 2015 fiscal year and $658.8 million at the end of the 2014 fiscal year. An order is reported in our backlog upon receipt of a purchase order from the customer or execution of a sales order contract. We anticipate that most of the 2015 backlog of orders will be filled during fiscal year 2016. At year-end, the segments with backlog were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):
