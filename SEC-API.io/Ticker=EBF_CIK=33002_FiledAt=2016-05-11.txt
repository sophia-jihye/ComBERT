 ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview 

Ennis, Inc. (the &#147; Company &#148;) (formerly Ennis Business Forms, Inc.) was organized under the laws of Texas in 1909. Ennis, Inc. and its subsidiaries print and manufacture a broad line of business forms and other business products (the &#147; Print Segment &#148;) and also manufacture a line of activewear (the &#147; Apparel Segment &#148;) for distribution throughout North America. The Print Segment distributes business products and forms throughout the United States primarily through independent dealers. This distributor channel encompasses independent print distributors, commercial printers, direct mail, fulfillment companies, payroll and accounts payable software companies, and advertising agencies, among others. We also sell products to many of our competitors to satisfy their customers&#146; needs. The Apparel Segment produces and sells activewear, including T-shirts, fleece goods and other wearables. Distribution of our activewear throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico is primarily through sales representatives. The distributor channel encompasses activewear wholesalers and screen printers. We offer a great selection of high-quality 

&#160;

activewear apparel with a wide variety of styles and colors in sizes ranging from toddler to 6XL. The apparel line features a wide variety of tees and fleece. 

On April 1, 2016, the Company entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement (the &#147; Initial Purchase Agreement &#148;) with Alstyle Operations, LLC (the &#147; Initial Buyer &#148;) and, for the limited purpose set forth in such Initial Purchase Agreement, Steve S. Hong. Under the Initial Purchase Agreement, the Initial Buyer agreed to acquire Alstyle Apparel, LLC and its subsidiaries (the &#147; Apparel Segment &#148;) from the Company for an aggregate purchase price of $88.0 million, consisting of $76.0 million in cash to be paid at closing, subject to a working capital adjustment, and an additional $12.0 million to be paid pursuant to a capital lease covering certain equipment utilized by the Apparel Segment that was to have been retained by the Company. The Initial Purchase Agreement contemplated post-closing transition services for up to 18 months. 

Under the Initial Purchase Agreement, the Company retained the right to terminate such agreement in the event that the Company were to receive an unsolicited purchase offer for the Apparel Segment that was not matched by the Initial Buyer, which, in the judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company in the exercise of their fiduciary duties on behalf of the Company&#146;s stockholders, deemed such offer to be a superior offer to the transactions contemplated by the Initial Purchase Agreement. 

On May 4, 2016, the Company received what was determined to be a superior offer from Gildan Activewear Inc. (&#147; Gildan &#148;). In connection therewith, the Company terminated the Initial Purchase Agreement and paid the required $3.0 million termination fee to the Initial Buyer in connection therewith. In connection with the superior offer, the Company and Gildan have entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement, dated May 4, 2016 (the &#147; Gildan Purchase Agreement &#148;), pursuant to which Gildan will acquire the Apparel Segment from the Company for an all-cash purchase price of $110.0 million, subject to a working capital adjustment, customary indemnification arrangements, and the other terms of such agreement (the &#147; Gildan Transaction &#148;). The closing of the Gildan Transaction, which is anticipated to occur during the Company&#146;s second fiscal quarter, is conditioned upon customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals. Following the closing, the Company will provide transition assistance to Gildan for certain administrative, financial, human resource, and information technology matters and will sublease from Gildan a portion of a certain property located in Anaheim, California that is leased by the Apparel Segment. As part of the purchase price, Gildan funded the Company&#146;s payment of the $3.0 million termination fee payable to the Initial Buyer of the Apparel Segment in connection with the termination of the Initial Purchase Agreement with such Initial Buyer, as more fully described above. The Company filed a current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 4, 2016 regarding the Gildan Transaction and reference is made herein to that report for further explanation. 

Based on presently available information, on a preliminary and unaudited basis, and assuming a closing date by the end of June 2016, the Company anticipates that it will incur a pre-tax loss on the sale of Alstyle Apparel to Gildan pursuant to the Gildan Purchase Agreement of between $25.0 million and $35.0 million. Based on certain tax elections expected to be made, the Company is expecting to be able to treat the loss as an operating loss for tax purposes. 

On July 31, 2015, we acquired the assets of CMC Group, Inc. for $0.3 million in cash plus the assumption of certain accrued liabilities. Management considers this acquisition immaterial and has omitted further discussion. 

On December 31, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the stock of Kay Toledo Tag and Special Service Partners and their related entities (collectively &#147;Kay Toledo&#148;) for $16.2 million cash, in a stock purchase transaction. An additional $1.0 million is available to be paid over the next 3 years under an earn-out provision if certain financial metrics are achieved. Kay Toledo has locations in Toledo, Ohio and Neenah, Wisconsin through Special Service Partners. Experts in digital printing and customer short-run printing, Kay Toledo produces tags, labels, tickets and commercial printing. Kay Toledo, generated approximately $25.0 million in unaudited sales for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014 and will continue to operate under its respective brand names. 

On October 3, 2014, we acquired the assets of Hoosier Data Forms for $0.2 million in cash plus the assumption of certain trade payables. Management considers this acquisition immaterial and has omitted further discussion. 

On June 16, 2014, we acquired the assets of Sovereign Business Forms, and its related entities, TRI-C Business Forms, Inc., Falcon Business Forms, Inc., Forms Manufacturers, Inc., Mutual Graphics, Inc., and Curtis Business 

&#160;

Forms, Inc. (collectively &#147;Sovereign&#148;) for $10.6 million in cash plus the assumption of certain trade liabilities. In addition, if certain financial metrics are met, an additional $1.0 million is available to be paid over the next 4 years under an earn-out provision. The cash portion of the purchase price was funded by borrowing under our line of credit facility. Sovereign produces snap sets, continuous forms and checks, laser forms, cut sheet forms and checks, and imprinted envelopes. Sovereign generated approximately $27.1 million in unaudited sales for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013 and will continue to operate under its respective brand names. 

Business Segment Overview 

Our management believes we are the largest provider of business forms, pressure-seal forms, labels, tags, envelopes, and presentation folders to independent distributors in the United States and are also a significant provider of blank T-shirts in North America to the activewear market. We operate in two reportable segments: Print and Apparel. For additional financial information concerning segment reporting, please see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-29. 

Print Segment 

The Print Segment, which represented 68%, 66%, and 63% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended February 29, 2016, February 28, 2015, and February 28, 2014, respectively, is in the business of manufacturing, designing and selling business forms and other printed business products primarily to distributors located in the United States. The Print Segment operates 58 manufacturing plants throughout the United States in 21 strategically located states. Approximately 96% of the business products manufactured by the Print Segment are custom and semi-custom products, constructed in a wide variety of sizes, colors, number of parts and quantities on an individual job basis depending upon the customers&#146; specifications. 

The products sold include snap sets, continuous forms, laser cut sheets, tags, labels, envelopes, integrated products, jumbo rolls and pressure sensitive products in short, medium and long runs under the following labels: Ennis &#174; , Royal Business Forms &#174; , Block Graphics &#174; , Specialized Printed Forms &#174; , 360&#186; Custom Labels SM , ColorWorx &#174; , Enfusion &#174; , Uncompromised Check Solutions &#174; , VersaSeal &#174; , Witt Printing &#174; , B&#38;D Litho &#174; , Genforms &#174; , PrintGraphics SM , Calibrated Forms &#174; , PrintXcel SM , Printegra &#174; , Curtis Business Forms SM , Falcon Business Forms SM , Forms Manufacturers SM , Mutual Graphics SM , TRI-C Business Forms SM and Hoosier Data Forms &#174; . The Print Segment also sells the Adams McClure &#174; brand (which provides Point of Purchase advertising for large franchise and fast food chains as well as kitting and fulfillment); the Admore &#174; and Folder Express &#174; brands (which provide presentation folders and document folders); Ennis Tag &#38; Label SM (which provides custom printed high performance labels and custom and stock tags); Atlas Tag &#38; Label &#174; , Kay Toledo Tag SM and Special Service Partners SM (SSP) (which provides custom and stock tags and labels); Trade Envelopes &#174; and Block Graphics &#174; , Wisco &#174; and National Imprint Corporation &#174; (which provide custom and imprinted envelopes) and Northstar &#174; and General Financial Supply &#174; (which provide financial and security documents). 

The Print Segment sells predominantly through private printers and independent distributors, as well as to many of our competitors. Northstar also sells direct to a small number of customers, generally large banking organizations (where a distributor is not acceptable or available to the end-user). Northstar acquired several of the top 25 banks in the United States as customers and is actively pursuing other large banks within the top 25 tier of banks in the United States. Adams McClure also sells direct to a small number of customers, where sales are generally through advertising agencies. 

The printing industry generally sells its products either through sales made predominantly to end users, a market dominated by a few large manufacturers, such as R.R. Donnelley, Staples, Standard Register (a subsidiary of Taylor Corporation), and Cenveo, or, like the Company, through a variety of independent distributors and distributor groups. While it is not possible, because of the lack of adequate public statistical information, to determine the Company&#146;s share of the total business products market, management believes the Company is the largest producer of business forms, pressure-seal forms, labels, tags, envelopes, and presentation folders in the United States distributing primarily through independent dealers. 

&#160;

There are a number of competitors that operate in this segment, ranging in size from single employee-owner operations to multi-plant organizations. We believe our strategic locations and buying power permit us to compete on a favorable basis within the distributor market on competitive factors, such as service, quality, and price. 

Distribution of business forms and other business products throughout the United States is primarily done through independent dealers, including business forms distributors, resellers, direct mail, commercial printers, payroll and accounts payable software companies, and advertising agencies. 

Raw materials of the Print Segment principally consist of a wide variety of weights, widths, colors, sizes, and qualities of paper for business products purchased from generally one major supplier at favorable prices based on the volume of business. 

Business products usage in the printing industry is generally not seasonal. General economic conditions and contraction of the traditional business forms industry are the predominant factor in quarterly volume fluctuations. 

Apparel Segment 

The Apparel Segment represented 32%, 34%, and 37% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended February 29, 2016, February 28, 2015, and February 28, 2014, respectively, and operates under the name of Alstyle Apparel (&#147; Alstyle &#148;). Alstyle markets high quality knitted activewear (including T-shirts, tank tops and fleece) across all market segments. The main products of Alstyle are standardized shirts manufactured in a variety of sizes and colors. Approximately 97% of Alstyle&#146;s revenues are derived from T-shirt sales and approximately 89% of its sales are domestic. Alstyle&#146;s branded product lines are sold mainly under the AAA &#174; , Alstyle Apparel and Activewear &#174; , and Murina &#174; brands. 

Alstyle&#146;s primary manufacturing operations are located in an owned manufacturing facility located in Agua Prieta, Mexico. Alstyle has three cut and sew facilities in Mexico (Agua Prieta, Ensenada and Hermosillo). In addition to its owned cut and sew facilities, Alstyle may also use outsourced manufacturers from time to time to supplement a portion of its cut and sew needs. After sewing and packaging are completed, the product is shipped to one of Alstyle&#146;s nine distribution centers located across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. 

Alstyle utilizes a customer-focused internal sales team comprised of twenty-one sales representatives assigned to specific geographic territories in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Sales representatives are assigned performance objectives for their respective territories and are provided financial incentives for achievement of their target objectives. Sales representatives are responsible for developing business with large accounts and spend a majority of their time in the field. 

Alstyle employs a staff of customer service representatives that handle call-in orders from smaller customers. Sales personnel sell directly to Alstyle&#146;s customer base, which consists primarily of screen printers, embellishers, retailers, and mass marketers. 

A majority of Alstyle&#146;s sales continue to be branded products, with the remainder being customers&#146; private label products. Generally, sales to screen printers and mass marketers are driven by price and the availability of products, which directly impacts our inventory level requirements. Sales in the private label business are characterized by higher customer loyalty. As such, the Company increased its sales emphasis in this area in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016. 

Alstyle&#146;s most popular styles are produced based on demand management forecasts to service at-once business and to level production schedules. Alstyle offers same-day shipping and uses third-party carriers to ship products to its customers. 

Alstyle&#146;s sales are seasonal, with sales in the first and second fiscal quarters generally being the highest. The apparel industry is characterized by rapid shifts in fashion, consumer demand and competitive pressures, resulting in both price and demand volatility. However, the imprinted activewear market to which Alstyle sells is generally &#147;event&#148; driven. Blank T-shirts can be thought of as &#147;walking billboards&#148; promoting movies, concerts, sports teams, and &#147;image&#148; brands. Still, the demand for any particular product varies from time to time based largely upon changes in 

&#160;

consumer preferences and general economic conditions affecting the apparel industry. Over the years, the customer base has moved from media-centric products to more fashion-oriented products. 

The apparel industry is comprised of numerous companies who manufacture and sell a wide range of products. Alstyle is primarily involved in the activewear market and produces T-shirts, fleece, blended and other fashion basic products and outsources some products from time-to-time from other countries like China, Pakistan, Central America and other foreign sources to sell to its customers through its sales representatives. Alstyle competes with many branded and private label manufacturers of knit apparel in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, some of which are larger in size and have greater financial resources than Alstyle. Alstyle competes on the basis of price, quality, service, and delivery. Alstyle&#146;s strategy is to provide the best value to its customers by delivering a consistent, high-quality product at a competitive price, not necessarily the lowest price. Alstyle&#146;s competitive disadvantage is its size in relation to its major competitors. Also, its brand name, Alstyle Apparel, is not as well-known as the brand names of its largest competitors, such as Gildan, Hanes, and Fruit of the Loom. While it is not possible to calculate precisely because of the lack of adequate public statistical information, management believes that Alstyle is one of the top providers of blank T-shirts in North America. 

Raw materials of the Apparel Segment principally consist of cotton and polyester yarn purchased from a number of major suppliers at prevailing market prices, although we purchased 43% of our cotton and yarn during the current period from one supplier. 

On April 1, 2016, the Company entered into the Initial Purchase Agreement with the Initial Buyer and, for the limited purpose set forth in such Initial Purchase Agreement, Steve S. Hong. Under the Initial Purchase Agreement, the Initial Buyer agreed to acquire the Apparel Segment from the Company for an aggregate purchase price of $88.0 million, consisting of $76.0 million in cash to be paid at closing, subject to a working capital adjustment, and an additional $12.0 million to be paid pursuant to a capital lease covering certain equipment utilized by the Apparel Segment that was to be retained by the Company. The Initial Purchase Agreement contemplated post-closing transition services for up to 18 months. 

Under the Initial Purchase Agreement, the Company retained the right to terminate such agreement in the event that the Company were to receive an unsolicited purchase offer for the Apparel Segment that was not matched by the Initial Buyer, which, in the judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company in the exercise of their fiduciary duties on behalf of the Company&#146;s stockholders constituted a superior offer to the transactions contemplated by the Initial Purchase Agreement. 

On May 4, 2016, the Company received what was determined to be a superior offer from Gildan. In connection therewith, the Company terminated the Initial Purchase Agreement and paid the required $3.0 million termination fee to the Initial Buyer in connection therewith. In connection with the superior offer, the Company and Gildan have entered into the Gildan Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which Gildan will acquire the Apparel Segment from the Company for an all-cash purchase price of $110.0 million, subject to a working capital adjustment, customary indemnification arrangements, and the other terms of such agreement. The closing of the Gildan Transaction, which is anticipated to occur during the Company&#146;s second fiscal quarter, is conditioned upon customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals. Following the closing, the Company will provide transition assistance to Gildan for certain administrative, financial, human resource, and information technology matters and will sublease from Gildan a portion of a certain property located in Anaheim, California that is leased by the Apparel Segment. As part of the purchase price, Gildan funded the Company&#146;s payment of the $3.0 million termination fee payable to the Initial Buyer of the Apparel Segment in connection with the termination of the Initial Purchase Agreement with such Initial Buyer, as more fully described above.

Based on presently available information, on a preliminary and unaudited basis, and assuming a closing date by the end of June 2016, the Company anticipates that it will incur a pre-tax loss on the sale of Alstyle Apparel to Gildan pursuant to the Gildan Purchase Agreement of between $25.0 million and $35.0 million. Based on certain tax elections expected to be made, the Company is expecting to be able to treat the loss as an operating loss for tax purposes.
