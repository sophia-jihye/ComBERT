 Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties 

Overview 

We are a leading independent producer of high-quality, specialty hydrocarbon products in North America. We are headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, and own specialty and fuel products facilities primarily located in northwest Louisiana, northwest Wisconsin, northern Montana, western Pennsylvania, Texas, New Jersey, eastern Missouri and North Dakota. We own and lease oilfield services locations in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and Ohio. We own and lease additional facilities, primarily related to production and distribution of specialty, fuel and oilfield services products, throughout the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;). Our business is organized into three segments: specialty products, fuel products and oilfield services. In our specialty products segment, we process crude oil and other feedstocks into a wide variety of customized lubricating oils, white mineral oils, solvents, petrolatums and waxes. Our specialty products are sold to domestic and international customers who purchase them primarily as raw material components for basic industrial, consumer and automotive goods. We also blend and market specialty products through our Royal Purple, Bel-Ray, TruFuel and Quantum brands. In our fuel products segment, we process crude oil into a variety of fuel and fuel-related products, including gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, asphalt and heavy fuel oils, and from time to time resell purchased crude oil to third party customers. Our oilfield services segment manufactures and markets products and provides oilfield services including drilling fluids, completion fluids and solids control services to the oil and gas exploration industry throughout the U.S. &#32;For the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 32.5% &#32;of our sales and 62.3% &#32;of our gross profit were generated from our specialty products segment, approximately 60.8% &#32;of our sales and 28.0% &#32;of our gross profit were generated from our fuel products segment and approximately 6.7% &#32;of our sales and 9.7% &#32;of our gross profit were generated from our oilfield services segment.

Drilling and Oilfield Services Assets. Anchor Drilling Fluids and Anchor Oilfield Services (as defined below) manufacture and market specialty products and provide oilfield services including drilling fluids, completion fluids and solids control services to the oil and gas exploration industry. We design, manufacture and package these specialty products at our locations in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and Ohio. These locations serve the great majority of major onshore oil fields in the U.S. 

Crude Oil Logistics Assets. We own and operate seven crude oil loading facilities and related assets in North Dakota and Montana, which provide us the ability to transport crude oil directly from the point of lease, into our crude oil loading facilities and then onto the Enbridge Pipeline System (&#8220;Enbridge Pipeline&#8221;) where it can be routed to our Superior refinery and/or third party customers. 

Storage, Distribution and Logistics Assets. We own and operate product terminals in Burnham, Illinois (&#8220;Burnham&#8221;), Rhinelander, Wisconsin (&#8220;Rhinelander&#8221;), Crookston, Minnesota (&#8220;Crookston&#8221;), and Proctor, Minnesota (&#8220;Duluth&#8221;), with aggregate storage capacities of approximately 150,000 , 166,000 , 156,000 &#32;and 200,000 &#32;barrels, respectively. These terminals, as well as additional owned and leased facilities throughout the U.S., facilitate the distribution of products in the Upper Midwest, East Coast, West Coast and Mid-Continent regions of the U.S. and Canada. 

We also use approximately 2,900 &#32;leased railcars to receive crude oil or distribute our products throughout the U.S. and Canada. In total, we have approximately 14.1 million &#32;barrels of aggregate storage capacity at our facilities and leased storage locations. 

Business Strategies 

Our management team is dedicated to improving our operations by executing the following strategies: 

&#8226; 

Concentrate on Stable Cash Flows. We intend to continue to focus on operating assets and businesses that generate stable cash flows over time. Approximately 32.5% &#32;of our sales and 62.3% &#32;of our gross profit in 2015 &#32;were generated by the sale of specialty products, a segment of our business which is characterized by stable customer relationships due to our customers&#8217; requirements for the highly specialized products we provide. In addition, we manage our exposure to crude oil price fluctuations in this segment by passing on incremental feedstock costs to our specialty products customers. In our fuel products segment, which accounted for 60.8% &#32;of our sales and 28.0% &#32;of our gross profit in 2015 , we seek to mitigate our exposure to fuel products margin volatility by maintaining a longer-term fuel products hedging program. Our entry into the oilfield services industry, which accounted for 6.7% &#32;of our sales and 9.7% &#32;of our gross profit in 2015 , also contributes to our diversity of cash flows. In addition, our recent acquisitions of various refineries located in different geographic regions provides for diversity of cash flows based on the refining margin environment in each such region. We believe the diversity of our operating assets and products, our broad customer base and our hedging activities help contribute to the stability of our cash flows. 

&#8226; 

Develop and Expand Our Customer Relationships. Due to the specialized nature of, and the long lead-time associated with, the development and production of many of our specialty products, our customers are incentivized to continue their relationships with us. We believe that our larger competitors do not work with customers as we do from product design to delivery for smaller volume specialty products like ours. We intend to continue to assist our existing customers in their efforts to expand their product offerings, as well as marketing specialty product formulations and services to new customers. By striving to maintain our long-term relationships with our broad base of existing customers and by adding new customers, we seek to limit our dependence on any one portion of our customer base. 

&#8226; 

Enhance Profitability of Our Existing Assets. We continue to evaluate opportunities to improve our existing asset base, to increase our throughput, profitability and cash flows. Following each of our asset acquisitions, we have undertaken projects designed to maximize the profitability of our acquired assets, such as: (1) the enhancement at our Superior refinery completed in November 2012, which enables the refinery to ship crude oil by railcar to our other facilities as well as third party customers, (2) the enhancements at our San Antonio refinery completed in December 2013 allowed us to blend finished gasoline and increased its production capacity from 14,500 bpd to 18,000 bpd, (3) the enhancements at our San Antonio refinery completed in December 2015 &#32;allowed us to take a portion of the refinery&#8217;s ultra-low sulfur diesel and jet fuel production and convert it into up to 3,000 bpd of higher margin solvents, (4) the more than doubling of esters production capacity at our Missouri facility completed in December 2015 and (5) the increase of production capacity at our Montana refinery from 10,000 bpd to 25,000 bpd, completed in February 2016 . We intend to further increase the profitability of our existing asset base through various measures which may include changing the product mix of our processing units, debottlenecking and expanding units as necessary to increase throughput, restarting idle assets and reducing costs by improving operations. We also continue to focus on optimizing current operations through improving reliability, product quality enhancements, product yield improvements and energy saving initiatives. 

&#8226; 

Pursue Strategic and Complementary Acquisitions. Our management team has demonstrated the ability to identify opportunities to acquire assets and product lines where we can enhance operations and improve profitability. In the future, we intend to continue to consider strategic acquisitions of assets or agreements with third parties that offer the opportunity for operational efficiencies, the potential for increased utilization and expansion of facilities, or the expansion of product offerings in each of our specialty products, fuel products and oilfield services segments. In addition, we may pursue selected acquisitions in new geographic or product areas to the extent we perceive similar opportunities. For example, since 2011 we have completed the following acquisitions that we believe significantly enhance and diversify our existing specialty products, fuel products and oilfield services segments: 

&#8226; 

Superior, Wisconsin, refinery (&#8220;Superior&#8221;) &#8212; a refinery that produces and sells gasoline, diesel, asphalt and heavy fuel oils acquired in September 2011 (&#8220;Superior Acquisition&#8221;). 

&#8226;

&#8226; 

ADF Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Anchor Drilling Fluids USA, Inc. (&#8220;Anchor Drilling Fluids&#8221;) &#8212; an independent provider and marketer of drilling fluids and completion fluids to the oil and gas exploration industry acquired in March 2014. 

&#8226; 

Specialty Oilfield Solutions, Ltd. assets (&#8220;Anchor Oilfield Services&#8221;) &#8212; a full-service drilling fluids and solids control company with primary operations in the Eagle Ford, Marcellus and Utica shale formations acquired from Specialty Oilfield Services, Ltd. in August 2014. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe that we are well positioned to execute our business strategies successfully based on the following competitive strengths: 

&#8226; 

We Offer Our Customers a Diverse Range of Specialty Products. We offer a wide range of approximately 4,500 specialty products. We believe that our ability to provide our customers with a more diverse selection of products than most of our competitors gives us an advantage in competing for new business. We believe that we are the only specialty products manufacturer that produces all four of naphthenic lubricating oils, paraffinic lubricating oils, waxes and solvents. A contributing factor in our ability to produce numerous specialty products is our ability to ship products between our facilities for product upgrading in order to meet customer specifications. 

&#8226; 

We Have Strong Relationships with a Broad Customer Base. We have long-term relationships with many of our customers and we believe that we will continue to benefit from these relationships. Our customer base includes more than 4,600 &#32;active accounts and we are continually seeking new customers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

&#8226; 

Our Facilities Have Advanced Technology. Our facilities are equipped with advanced, flexible technology that allows us to produce high-grade specialty products and to produce fuel products that comply with low sulfur fuel regulations. For example, our fuel products refineries have the capability to make ultra-low sulfur diesel and gasoline that meet federally mandated low sulfur standards and the Mobile Source Air Toxic Rule II standards (&#8220;MSAT II Standards&#8221;) set by the EPA requiring the reduction of benzene levels in gasoline. Also, unlike larger refineries which lack some of the equipment necessary to achieve the narrow distillation ranges associated with the production of specialty products, our operations are capable of producing a wide range of products tailored to our customers&#8217; needs. 

&#8226; 

We Have an Experienced Management Team. Our management has a proven track record of enhancing value through the acquisition, exploitation and integration of refining assets and the development and marketing of specialty products and services. Our senior management team has an average of over 25 years of industry experience. Our team&#8217;s extensive experience and contacts within the refining industry provide a strong foundation and focus for managing and enhancing our operations, accessing strategic acquisition opportunities and constructing and enhancing the profitability of new assets. 

Ongoing Acquisition Activities 

Consistent with our business growth strategy, we are continuously engaged in discussions with potential sellers regarding the possible purchase of assets and operations that are strategic and complementary to our existing operations. These acquisition efforts may involve participation by us in processes that have been made public and involve a number of potential buyers, commonly referred to as &#8220;auction&#8221; processes, as well as situations in which we believe we are the only potential buyer or one of a limited number of potential buyers in negotiations with the potential seller. These acquisition efforts often involve assets and operations which, if acquired, could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations and require special financing. 

We typically do not announce a transaction until we have executed a definitive acquisition agreement. However, in certain cases in order to protect our business interests or for other reasons, we may defer public announcement of an acquisition until closing or a later date. Past experience has demonstrated that discussions and negotiations regarding a potential acquisition can advance or terminate in a short period of time. Moreover, the closing of any transaction for which we have entered into a definitive acquisition agreement will be subject to customary and other closing conditions, which may not ultimately be satisfied or waived. Accordingly, we can give no assurance that our current or future acquisition efforts will be successful. Although we expect the acquisitions we make to be accretive in the long term, we can provide no assurance that our expectations will ultimately be realized.

We service oil and gas resource plays in North America, including the Bakken, Barnett, Eagle Ford, Fayetteville, Granite Wash, Haynesville, Marcellus, Niobrara, Permian, Piceance, Uinta and Utica shale formations. 

We develop custom formulations and innovative solutions based on unique customer and well specifications. Through our extensive line of drilling and completion fluids, we deliver solutions that reduce drilling and completion time, help to control reservoir formation pressures and maximize oil and gas production, contributing to improved well economics for end-users. 

Terminals 

Our terminals are complementary to our refineries and play a key role in moving our products to end-user markets by providing services including distribution and blending to achieve specified products and storage and inventory management. We operate the following terminals: 

Burnham Terminal : We own and operate a terminal located on an 11 &#32;acre site, in Burnham, Illinois. The Burnham terminal receives specialty products from certain of our refineries primarily by railcar and distributes them by truck and railcar to our customers in the Upper Midwest and East Coast regions of the U.S. and in Canada. The terminal includes a tank farm with 90 tanks having aggregate storage capacity of approximately 150,000 barrels, as well as blending equipment for producing engine oil additives and tackifiers. 

Rhinelander Terminal : We own and operate a terminal located on an 18 &#32;acre site, in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. The Rhinelander terminal receives asphalt by truck from the Superior refinery and distributes product by truck. Asphalt from this terminal is sold to customers in the Upper Midwest region of the U.S. The terminal includes a tank farm with four tanks with aggregate storage capacity of approximately 166,000 &#32;barrels. 

Crookston Terminal: We own and operate a terminal located on a 19 &#32;acre site, in Crookston, Minnesota. The Crookston terminal receives asphalt by truck from the Superior refinery and distributes product by truck. Asphalt from this terminal is sold to customers in the Upper Midwest region of the U.S. The terminal includes a tank farm with three tanks with aggregate storage capacity of approximately 156,000 &#32;barrels. 

Duluth Terminal: We own and operate a terminal located on a 49 &#32;acre site, in Proctor, Minnesota. The Duluth terminal is supplied refined fuel products from the Superior refinery by the Magellan pipeline and receives ethanol and biodiesel products by truck. Fuel products from this terminal are distributed by truck to customers in Minnesota and northern Wisconsin. The terminal includes seven tanks with aggregate storage capacity of approximately 200,000 &#32;barrels. 

In addition to the above terminals, we own and lease additional facilities, primarily related to distribution of finished products, throughout the U.S. 

Crude Oil Logistics Assets &#160; 

We own and operate seven crude oil loading facilities and related assets in North Dakota and Montana, which provide us with the ability to transport crude oil directly from the point of lease into our crude oil loading facilities and then onto the Enbridge Pipeline where it can be routed to our Superior refinery and/or third party customers. 

Other Logistics Assets 

We use approximately 2,900 &#32;railcars leased from various lessors. This fleet of railcars enables us to receive and ship crude oil and distribute various specialty products and fuel products throughout the U.S. and Canada to and from each of our facilities. 

Our Crude Oil and Feedstock Supply 

We purchase crude oil and other feedstocks from major oil companies as well as from various crude oil gatherers and marketers in Texas, north Louisiana, North Dakota and Canada. Crude oil supplies at our refineries are as follows:

&#160; 

Tank truck, railcar and Plains Pipeline 

In 2015 , subsidiaries of Plains supplied us with approximately 37.4% &#32;of our total crude oil supply under term contracts and month-to-month evergreen crude oil supply contracts. In 2015 , BP supplied us with approximately 14.8% &#32;of our total crude oil supply under the BP Purchase Agreement. Each of our refineries is dependent on one or more key suppliers and the loss of any of these suppliers would adversely affect our financial results to the extent we were unable to find another supplier of this substantial amount of crude oil. For more information about the BP Purchase Agreement, please read the information provided under Note 6 &#32;&#8220; Commitments and Contingencies &#8221; in Part II, Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Annual Report. 

We do not maintain long-term contracts with most of our crude oil suppliers. For example, our contracts with Plains are currently month-to-month, terminable upon 90 days&#8217; notice. In April 2012, we amended and restated the BP Purchase Agreement, which had an initial term of one year ending April 1, 2013, and automatically renews for successive one-year terms unless terminated by either party upon 90 days&#8217; notice prior to the end of any renewal term. We also purchase foreign crude oil when its spot market price is attractive relative to the price of crude oil from domestic sources. 

We have various long-term feedstock supply agreements with Phillips 66, with remaining terms ranging from one to two years, with some agreements operating under the option to continue on a month-to-month basis thereafter, for feedstocks that are key to the operations of our Karns City and Dickinson facilities. In addition, certain products of our refineries can be used as feedstocks by these facilities. 

We believe that adequate supplies of crude oil and feedstocks will continue to be available to us. 

Our cost to acquire crude oil and feedstocks and the prices for which we ultimately can sell refined products depend on a number of factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil and other feedstocks and specialty and fuel products. These, in turn, are dependent upon, among other things, the availability of imports, overall economic conditions, production levels of domestic and foreign suppliers, U.S. relationships with foreign governments, political affairs and the extent of governmental regulation. We have historically been able to pass on the costs associated with increased crude oil and feedstock prices to our specialty products customers, although the increase in selling prices for specialty products typically lags a rising cost of crude oil. From time to time, we use a hedging program to manage a portion of our commodity price risk. Please read Part II, Item 7A &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk &#8212; Commodity Price Risk &#160;&#8212; Derivative Instruments &#8221; for a discussion of our hedging program. 

Our Products, Markets and Customers 

Products 

Specialty Products and Fuel Products. We produce a full line of specialty products, including lubricating oils, solvents, waxes, packaged and synthetic specialty products, other by-products, as well as a variety of fuel and fuel related products, asphalt and heavy fuel oils. Our customers purchase specialty products primarily as raw material components for basic industrial, consumer and automotive goods. 

Oilfield Services. We are an independent provider and marketer of drilling fluids and completion fluids. 

&#8226; 

Drilling fluids &#8212; Drilling fluids, often referred to as &#8220;drilling mud,&#8221; are an essential and critical product of the drilling process for every oil and gas well. We provide three different types of drilling fluids including water-based mud, oil-based mud and synthetic-based mud. 

&#8226; 

Completion fluids &#8212; Completion fluids replace drilling fluids during the final operations leading up to oil and gas production from a well. Completion fluids are critical products designed to control reservoir formation pressures and minimize formation damage in the event of a failure in down hole equipment. 

&#8226; 

Solids control &#8212; Solids control is employed in drilling operations to filter out cuttings and clean the drilling fluid before it is pumped back into the well.

Based on the percentage of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Except for the listed fuel products and certain products sold by our Royal Purple, Bel-Ray and Calumet Packaging facilities and United Petroleum assets, we do not produce any of these end-use products. 

Marketing 

We have an experienced marketing department with average industry tenure of approximately 20 years. Our salespeople regularly visit customers, and our marketing department works closely with both the laboratories at our production facilities and our technical services department to help create specialized blends that will work optimally for our customers. 

Markets 

Specialty Products. The specialty products market represents a small portion of the overall petroleum refining industry in the U.S. Of the nearly 140 &#32;refineries currently in operation in the U.S., only a small number of the refineries are considered specialty products producers and only a few compete with us in terms of the number of products produced. 

Our specialty products are utilized in applications across a broad range of industries, including: 

&#8226; 

industrial goods such as metalworking fluids, belts, hoses, sealing systems, batteries, hot melt adhesives, pressure sensitive tapes, electrical transformers, refrigeration compressors and drilling fluids; 

&#8226; 

consumer goods such as candles, petroleum jelly, creams, tonics, lotions, coating on paper cups, chewing gum base, automotive aftermarket car-care products (e.g., fuel injection cleaners, tire shines and polishes), lamp oils, charcoal lighter fluids, camping fuel and various aerosol products; and 

&#8226; 

automotive goods such as motor oils, greases, transmission fluid and tires. 

We have the capability to ship our specialty products worldwide. In the U.S., we ship our specialty products via railcars, trucks and barges. We use our fleet of approximately 2,900 &#32;leased railcars to ship our specialty products and a majority of our specialty products sales are shipped in trucks owned and operated by several different third-party carriers. For shipments outside of North America, which accounted for less than 10% of our consolidated sales in 2015 , we ship via railcars and trucks to several ports where the product is loaded onto vessels for shipment to customers abroad. 

Fuel Products. The fuel products market represents a large portion of the overall petroleum refining industry in the U.S. Of the nearly 140 &#32;refineries currently in operation in the U.S., a large number of the refineries are fuel products producers; however, only a few compete with us in our local markets. 

Gulf Coast Market (PADD 3) 

Fuel products produced at our Shreveport refinery can be sold locally or to the Midwest region of the U.S. through the TEPPCO pipeline. Local sales are made from the TEPPCO terminal in Bossier City, Louisiana, located approximately 15 miles from the Shreveport refinery, as well as from our own Shreveport refinery terminal. 

Gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from the Shreveport refinery is sold primarily into the Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas markets, and any excess volumes are sold to marketers further up the TEPPCO pipeline. Should the appropriate market conditions arise, we have the capability to redirect and sell additional volumes into the Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas &#32;markets rather than transport them to the Midwest region via the TEPPCO pipeline. 

The Shreveport refinery has the capacity to produce about 9,000 bpd of commercial jet fuel that can be marketed to the U.S. Department of Defense, sold as Jet-A locally or sold via the TEPPCO pipeline, or occasionally transferred to the Cotton Valley refinery to be processed further as a feedstock to produce solvents. We have a sales contract with the U.S. Department of Defense for approximately 2,500 bpd of jet fuel. This contract is effective until March 2016 and is bid annually. 

Fuel products produced at our San Antonio refinery are sold locally in Texas. Additionally, the San Antonio refinery produces commercial and specialty jet fuel that can be marketed to the U.S. Department of Defense or sold locally as Jet-A fuel. We have a sales contract with the U.S. Department of Defense for approximately 550 bpd of jet fuel. This contract is effective until March 2017. 

Additionally, we produce a number of fuel-related products including fluid catalytic cracking (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) feedstock, vacuum residuals and mixed butanes. FCC feedstock is sold to other refiners as a feedstock for their FCC units to make fuel products. Vacuum residuals are blended or processed further to make asphalt products. Volumes of vacuum residuals which we cannot process are sold locally into the fuel oil market or sold via railcar to other refiners. Mixed butanes are primarily available in the summer months and are primarily sold to local marketers. If the mixed butanes are not sold, they are blended into our gasoline production. 

Upper Midwest Market (PADD 2) 

Fuel products produced at our Superior refinery can be sold locally, in the Upper Midwest region of the U.S. and in Canada. The Superior wholesale business sells fuel products produced at the Superior refinery through several Magellan pipeline terminals in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Utah &#32;and through its own leased or owned product terminals located in Superior, Wisconsin, and Duluth, Minnesota. The Superior wholesale business also sells gasoline wholesale to Calumet branded gas stations throughout the Upper Midwest, which are owned and operated by independent franchisees. 

Northwest Market (PADD 4) 

Fuel products produced at our Montana refinery can be sold locally and in Idaho, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming and Canada. Seasonally, the Montana refinery transports fuel products to terminals in Washington. 

We have a sales contract with the U.S. Department of Defense for approximately 150 bpd of jet fuel. This contract is effective until September 2016. 

Oilfield Services. We sell oilfield products and services in the Bakken, Barnett, Eagle Ford, Fayetteville, Granite Wash, Haynesville, Marcellus, Niobrara, Permian, Piceance, Uinta and Utica shale formations. 

Customers 

Specialty Products. We have a diverse customer base for our specialty products, with approximately 3,600 active accounts. Many of our customers are long-term customers who use our products in specialty applications, after an approval process ranging from six months to two years. No single customer in our specialty products segment accounted for 10% or greater of consolidated sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

Fuel Products. We have a diverse customer base for our fuel products, with approximately 600 active accounts. Our diverse customer base includes wholesale distributors and retail chains. We are able to sell the majority of the fuel products we produce at the Shreveport refinery to the local markets of Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas . We also have the ability to ship additional fuel products from the Shreveport refinery to the Midwest region through the TEPPCO pipeline should the need arise. Additionally, we are able to sell the majority of the fuel products we produce at the Superior refinery to local markets in Minnesota and Wisconsin. We also have the ability to ship additional fuel products from the Superior refinery to the Upper Midwest region through the Magellan pipeline. The majority of our fuel products produced at our Montana refinery are sold to local markets in Montana and Idaho as well as in Canada. Fuel products produced at our San Antonio refinery are sold to local markets in Texas. No single customer in our fuel products segment represented 10% or greater of consolidated sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

Oilfield Services. We have a diversified, established and unique customer base for our oilfield services, with approximately 400 active accounts. Our customers are companies operating in the domestic oil and gas exploration and production industry. No single customer in our oilfield services segment accounted for 10% or greater of consolidated sales in each of the two years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

Competition 

Competition in our markets is from a combination of large, integrated petroleum companies, independent refiners, wax production companies and oilfield services companies. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than us and are engaged on a national or international basis in many segments of the petroleum products business, including exploration and production, refining, transportation and marketing. These competitors may have greater flexibility in responding to or absorbing market changes occurring in one or more of these business segments. We distinguish our competitors according to the products that they produce. Set forth below is a description of our significant competitors according to product category. 

Naphthenic Lubricating Oils. Our primary competitors in producing naphthenic lubricating oils include Ergon Refining, Inc., Cross Oil Refining and Marketing, Inc., San Joaquin Refining Co., Inc. and Martin Midstream Partners L.P. 

Paraffinic Lubricating Oils. Our primary competitors in producing paraffinic lubricating oils include ExxonMobil Corporation, Motiva Enterprises, LLC, Phillips 66, Petro-Canada, HollyFrontier Corporation, Chevron Corporation, Sonneborn Refined Products and Royal Dutch Shell plc. 

Paraffin Waxes. Our primary competitors in producing paraffin waxes include ExxonMobil, HollyFrontier Corporation, The International Group Inc. and Sonneborn Refined Products. 

Solvents. Our primary competitors in producing solvents include CITGO Petroleum Corporation, ExxonMobil Chemical, Phillips 66 and Royal Dutch Shell plc. 

Packaged and Synthetic Specialty Products . Our primary competitors in retail and commercial packaged and synthetic specialty products include ExxonMobil (Mobil 1), Ashland, Inc. (Valvoline) and BP Lubricants, USA (Castrol). Our primary competitors in industrial packaged and synthetic specialty products include ExxonMobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell plc and Chevron. 

Fuel Products and By-Products. Our primary competitors in producing fuel products in the local markets in which we operate include Delek US Holdings, Flint Hills Resources, Northern Tier Energy LP, ExxonMobil, Valero Energy Corporation, Phillips 66, Cenex, Alon USA and Marathon Petroleum Corporation. 

Oilfield Services. Our primary competitors in servicing oilfields in the local markets in which we operate include Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Newpark Resources and other regional competition. 

Our ability to compete effectively depends on our responsiveness to customer needs and our ability to maintain competitive prices and product and service offerings. We believe that our flexibility and customer responsiveness differentiate us from many 

of our larger competitors. However, it is possible that new or existing competitors could enter the markets in which we operate, which could negatively affect our financial performance. 

Governmental Regulation 

From time to time, we are a party to certain claims and litigation incidental to our business, including claims made by various taxation and regulatory authorities, such as the EPA, various state environmental regulatory bodies, the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;), various state and local departments of revenue and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;), as the result of audits or reviews of our business. In addition, we have property, business interruption, general liability and various other insurance policies that may result in certain losses or expenditures being reimbursed to us. 

Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters 

Environmental 

We conduct crude oil and specialty hydrocarbon refining, blending and terminal operations in addition to providing oilfield services and products, which activities are subject to stringent federal, state, regional and local laws and regulations governing worker health and safety, the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection. These laws and regulations impose obligations that are applicable to our operations, such as requiring the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, restricting the manner in which we may release materials into the environment, requiring remedial activities or capital expenditures to mitigate pollution from former or current operations, requiring the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection and imposing substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations or the corresponding incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of delays in the permitting, development or expansion of projects; and the issuance of injunctive relief limiting or prohibiting our activities in a particular area. Moreover, certain of these laws impose joint and several, strict liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where petroleum hydrocarbons, wastes or other materials have been disposed of or released. In addition, new laws and regulations, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, increased governmental enforcement or other developments could significantly increase our operational or compliance expenditures, as discussed below in more detail. 

Remediation of subsurface contamination is in process at certain of our refinery sites and is being overseen by the appropriate state agencies. Based on current investigative and remedial activities, we believe that the soil and groundwater contamination at these refineries can be controlled or remedied without having a material adverse effect on our financial condition. However, such costs are often unpredictable and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the future costs will not become material. 

San Antonio Refinery 

In connection with the San Antonio Acquisition, we agreed to indemnify NuStar for an unlimited term and without consideration of a monetary deductible or cap from any environmental liabilities associated with the San Antonio refinery, except for any governmental penalties or fines that may result from NuStar&#8217;s actions or inactions during NuStar&#8217;s 20-month period of ownership of the San Antonio refinery. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (&#8220;Anadarko&#8221;) and Age Refining, Inc. (&#8220;Age Refining&#8221;), a third party that has since entered bankruptcy, are subject to a 1995 Agreed Order from the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, now known as the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, pursuant to which Anadarko and Age Refining are obligated to assess and remediate certain contamination at the San Antonio refinery that predates our acquisition of the facility. We do not expect this pre-existing contamination at the San Antonio refinery to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 

Montana Refinery 

In connection with the acquisition of the Montana refinery from Connacher Oil and Gas Limited (&#8220;Connacher&#8221;), we became a party to an existing 2002 Refinery Initiative Consent Decree (the &#8220;Montana Consent Decree&#8221;) with the EPA and the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (the &#8220;MDEQ&#8221;). The material obligations imposed by the Montana Consent Decree have been completed. On September 27, 2012, Montana Refining Company, Inc. received a final Corrective Action Order on Consent, replacing the refinery&#8217;s previously held hazardous waste permit. This Corrective Action Order on Consent governs the investigation and remediation of contamination at the Montana refinery. We believe the majority of damages related to such contamination at the Montana refinery are covered by a contractual indemnity provided by HollyFrontier Corporation (&#8220;Holly&#8221;), the owner and operator of the Montana refinery prior to its acquisition by Connacher, under an asset purchase agreement between Holly and Connacher, pursuant to which Connacher acquired the Montana refinery. Under this asset purchase agreement, Holly agreed to indemnify Connacher and Montana Refining Company, Inc., subject to timely notification, certain conditions and certain monetary baskets and caps, for environmental conditions arising under Holly&#8217;s ownership and operation of the Montana refinery and existing as of the date of sale to Connacher. During 2014, Holly provided us a notice challenging our position that Holly is obligated to indemnify our remediation expenses for environmental conditions to the extent arising under Holly&#8217;s ownership and operation of the refinery and existing as of the date of sale to Connacher, which expenses totaled approximately $17.6 million &#32;as of December 31, 

2015 , of which $14.4 million &#32;was capitalized into the cost of our recently completed expansion project and $3.2 million &#32;was expensed. We continue to believe that Holly is responsible to indemnify us for these remediation expenses disputed by Holly, and on September 22, 2015, we initiated a lawsuit against Holly and the sellers of the Montana refinery that were party to the asset purchase agreement. On November 24, 2015, Holly and such sellers filed a motion to dismiss the case pending arbitration. We are opposing the motion. In the event we are unsuccessful, we will be responsible for those remediation expenses. We expect that we may incur some costs to remediate other environmental conditions at the Montana refinery; however, we believe at this time that these other costs we may incur will not be material to our financial position or results of operations. 

Superior Refinery 

In connection with the acquisition of the Superior refinery, we became a party to an existing Refinery Initiative Consent Decree (&#8220;Superior Consent Decree&#8221;) with the EPA and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (&#8220;WDNR&#8221;) that applies, in part, to our Superior refinery. Under the Superior Consent Decree, we must complete certain reductions in air emissions at the Superior refinery as well as report upon certain emissions from the refinery to the EPA and the WDNR. We estimate costs of up to $4.0 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 , to make known equipment upgrades and conduct other discrete tasks in compliance with the Superior Consent Decree. Failure to perform these required tasks under the Superior Consent Decree could result in the imposition of stipulated penalties, which could be material. We are currently assessing certain past actions at the refinery for compliance with the terms of the Superior Consent Decree, which actions may be subject to stipulated penalties under the Superior Consent Decree but, in any event, we do not currently believe that the imposition of such penalties for those actions, should they be imposed, would be material. In addition, we are pursuing certain additional environmental and safety-related projects at the Superior refinery. Completion of these additional projects will result in us incurring costs, which could be substantial. We incurred approximately $0.7 million &#32;of costs in 2014 related to installing process equipment at the Superior refinery pursuant to the EPA fuel content regulations. 

On June 29, 2012, the EPA issued a Finding of Violation/Notice of Violation to the Superior refinery, which included a proposed penalty amount of $0.1 million . This finding is in response to information that we provided to the EPA in response to an information request. The EPA alleges that the efficiency of the flares at the Superior refinery is lower than regulatory requirements. We are contesting the allegations and are in settlement discussions with the EPA to resolve this issue. We have not yet received formal action from the EPA. We do not believe that the resolution of these allegations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 

We are contractually indemnified by Murphy Oil Corporation (&#8220;Murphy Oil&#8221;) under an asset purchase agreement between Murphy Oil and us for specified environmental liabilities arising from the operation of the Superior refinery including: (i) certain obligations arising out of the Superior Consent Decree (including payment of a civil penalty required under the Superior Consent Decree), (ii) certain liabilities arising in connection with Murphy Oil&#8217;s transport of certain wastes and other materials to specified offsite real properties for disposal or recycling prior to the Superior Acquisition and (iii) certain liabilities for certain third party actions, suits or proceedings alleging exposure, prior to the Superior Acquisition, of an individual to wastes or other materials at the specified on-site real property, which wastes or other materials were spilled, released, emitted or otherwise discharged by Murphy Oil. We believe contractual indemnity by Murphy Oil for such specified environmental liabilities is unlimited in duration and not subject to any monetary deductibles or maximums. The amount of any damages payable by Murphy Oil pursuant to the contractual indemnities under the asset purchase agreement are net of any amount recoverable under an environmental insurance policy that we obtained in connection with the Superior Acquisition, which named Murphy Oil and us as insureds and covers environmental conditions existing at the Superior refinery prior to the Superior Acquisition. 

Shreveport, Cotton Valley and Princeton Refineries 

On December 23, 2010 , we entered into a settlement agreement with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (&#8220;LDEQ&#8221;) under LDEQ&#8217;s &#8220;Small Refinery and Single Site Refinery Initiative,&#8221; covering the Shreveport, Princeton and Cotton Valley refineries. This settlement agreement became effective on January 31, 2012 . The settlement agreement, termed the &#8220;Global Settlement,&#8221; resolved alleged violations of the federal Clean Air Act and federal Clean Water Act regulations that arose prior to December 23, 2010 . Among other things, we agreed to complete beneficial environmental programs and implement emissions reduction projects at our Shreveport, Cotton Valley and Princeton refineries on an agreed-upon schedule. During 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we incurred approximately $6.8 million &#32;and $0.6 million , respectively, of such expenditures and estimate additional expenditures of approximately $3.0 million &#32;to $5.0 million &#32;of capital expenditures and expenditures related to additional personnel and environmental studies through 2016 as a result of the implementation of these requirements. These capital investment requirements will be incorporated into our annual capital expenditures budget, and we do not expect any additional capital expenditures as a result of the required audits or required operational changes included in the Global Settlement to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 

We are contractually indemnified by Shell Oil Company (&#8220;Shell&#8221;), as successor to Pennzoil-Quaker State Company, and Atlas Processing Company, under an asset purchase agreement between Shell and us, for specified environmental liabilities arising from the operations of the Shreveport refinery prior to our acquisition of the facility. We believe the contractual indemnity is 

unlimited in amount and duration, but requires us to contribute $1.0 million &#32;of the first $5.0 million &#32;of indemnified costs for certain of the specified environmental liabilities. 

Bel-Ray Facility 

Bel-Ray executed an Administrative Consent Order (&#8220;ACO&#8221;) with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, effective January 4, 1994, which required investigation and remediation of contamination at or emanating from the Bel-Ray facility. In 2000, Bel-Ray entered into a fixed price remediation contract with Weston Solutions (&#8220;Weston&#8221;), a large remediation contractor, whereby Weston agreed to be fully liable for the remediation of the soil and groundwater issues at the facility, including an offsite groundwater plume pursuant to the ACO (&#8220;Weston Agreement&#8221;). The Weston Agreement set up a trust fund to reimburse Weston, administered by Bel-Ray&#8217;s environmental counsel. As of December 31, 2015 , the trust fund contained approximately $0.8 million . In addition, Weston has remediation cost containment insurance, should Weston be unable to complete the work required under the Weston Agreement. In connection with the Bel-Ray Acquisition, we became a party to the Weston Agreement. 

Weston has been addressing the environmental issues at the Bel-Ray facility over time, and the next phase will address the groundwater issues, which extend offsite. 

Air Emissions 

Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, as amended (&#8220;CAA&#8221;), and comparable state and local laws. The CAA Amendments of 1990 require most industrial operations in the U.S. to incur capital expenditures to meet the air emission control standards that are developed and implemented by the EPA and state environmental agencies. Under the CAA, facilities that emit regulated air pollutants are subject to stringent regulations, including requirements to install various levels of control technology on sources of pollutants. In addition, in recent years, the petroleum refining sector has become subject to stringent federal regulations that impose maximum achievable control technology (&#8220;MACT&#8221;) on refinery equipment emitting certain listed hazardous air pollutants. Some of our facilities have been included within the categories of sources regulated by MACT rules. Our refining and terminal operations that emit regulated air pollutants are also subject to air emissions permitting requirements that incorporate stringent control technology requirements for which we may incur significant capital expenditures. Any renewal of those air emissions permits or a need to modify existing or obtain new air emissions permits has the potential to delay the development of our projects. We can provide no assurance that future compliance with existing or any new laws, regulations or permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. For example, on October 1, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA that became effective on December 28, 2015, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (&#8220;NAAQS&#8221;) for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. Also, in December 2015, the EPA published a final rule that amends three refinery standards already in effect, imposing additional or, in some cases, new emission control requirements on subject refineries. The final rule requires, among other things, the monitoring of air concentrations of benzene around the refinery fence line perimeter and submittal of the fence line monitoring data to the EPA on a quarterly basis; upgraded emissions controls for storage tanks, including controls for smaller capacity storage vessels and storage vessels storing materials with lower vapor pressures than previously regulated; enhanced performance requirements for flares including the use of a minimum of three pollution prevention measures, continuous monitoring of flares and pressure release devices and analysis and remedy of flare release events; and compliance with emissions standards for delayed coking units. These final rules and any other future air emissions rulemakings could impact us by requiring installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, resulting in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increasing our capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our business. 

The CAA authorizes the EPA to require modifications in the formulation of the refined transportation fuel products we manufacture in order to limit the emissions associated with the fuel product&#8217;s final use. For example, in February 2000, the EPA published regulations limiting the sulfur content allowed in gasoline. These regulations, referred to as &#8220;Tier 2 Standards,&#8221; required the phase-in of gasoline sulfur standards beginning in 2004, with special provisions for small refiners and for refiners serving those western U.S. states exhibiting lesser air quality problems. Similarly, the EPA published regulations that limit the sulfur content of highway diesel beginning in 2006 from its former level of 500 parts per million (&#8220;ppm&#8221;) to 15 ppm (the &#8220;ultra-low sulfur standard&#8221;). Our Shreveport, Superior, Montana and San Antonio refineries have implemented the sulfur standard with respect to produced gasoline and produced diesel meeting the ultra-low sulfur standard. In April 2014, the EPA published more stringent sulfur standards, referred to as &#8220;Tier 3 Standards,&#8221; including requiring that motor gasoline will not contain more than 10 ppm of sulfur on an annual average basis by January 1, 2017. Our Shreveport, Superior, Montana and San Antonio refineries will implement the 10 ppm sulfur standard with respect to produced gasoline by January 1, 2017, and we do not believe any remaining equipment upgrades at one or more of these refineries necessary to achieve the 10 ppm sulfur standard with respect to such produced gasoline will result in any material capital expenditures by us. In addition, we are required to meet the MSAT II Standards adopted by the EPA to reduce the benzene content of motor gasoline produced at our facilities. We have completed capital projects at our Shreveport, Superior, Montana and San Antonio refineries to comply with these fuel quality requirements. 

The EPA has issued Renewable Fuel Standard (&#8220;RFS&#8221;) mandates, requiring refiners such as us to blend renewable fuels into the petroleum fuels they produce and sell in the U.S. We, and other refiners subject to RFS, may meet the RFS requirements by 

blending the necessary volumes of renewable transportation fuels produced by us or purchased from third parties. To the extent that refiners will not or cannot blend renewable fuels into the products they produce in the quantities required to satisfy their obligations under the RFS program, those refiners must purchase renewable credits, referred to as RINs, to maintain compliance. To the extent that we exceed the minimum volumetric requirements for blending of renewable transportation fuels, we generate our own RINs for which we have the option of retaining the RINs for current or future RFS compliance or selling those RINs on the open market. 

Under the RFS program, the volume of renewable fuels that obligated parties are required to blend into their finished petroleum fuels increases annually over time until 2022. Our Shreveport, Superior, Montana and San Antonio refineries are normally subject to compliance with the RFS mandates. However, the RFS program further provides for a small refinery to be granted a temporary exemption from its annual mandated volume of renewable fuels if such refinery can demonstrate that compliance with those mandated volumes would cause the refinery to suffer disproportionate economic hardship. In October 2014, the EPA granted both the Shreveport and San Antonio refineries a &#8220;small refinery exemption&#8221; under the RFS for the 2013 calendar year. Under these 2013 exemptions granted by the EPA, both the Shreveport and San Antonio refineries are not subject to the requirements of RFS as an &#8220;obligated party&#8221; for fuels produced at these refineries between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2013. As a result of the exemptions, our requirements to purchase RINs for 2013 compliance were reduced by approximately 39 million RINs. As a result of the exemptions, we sold approximately 31 million &#32;RINs for a gain of approximately $18.2 million &#32;during the fourth quarter of 2014. 

On November 30, 2015, the EPA issued final multi-year volume mandates for 2014 to 2016. While these volume mandates are generally lower than the statutory mandates, they represent a slight increase over the volumes initially proposed by the EPA for this three-year period and such volume mandates could be increased in the future. We have reapplied for the small refinery exemption at selected refineries for the full year 2014 and are in the process of an assessment to determine which of our fuels refineries potentially could be eligible for economic hardship exemptions for the 2015 calendar year. While we received a small refinery exemption for the Shreveport and San Antonio refineries for 2013, there is no assurance that such an exemption will be obtained for either of these refineries for the 2014 year or in future years, which would result in the need for more RINs for the applicable calendar year. Our gross 2015 annual RINs obligation, which includes RINs that were required to be secured through either our own blending or through the purchase of RINs in the open market, was 99 million &#32;RINs for the 2015 calendar year. 

On October 13, 2010, the EPA raised the maximum amount of ethanol content allowed under federal law from 10% to 15% for cars and light trucks manufactured since 2007, and on January 21, 2011, EPA extended the maximum allowable ethanol content of 15% to apply to cars and light trucks manufactured between 2001 and 2006. The maximum amount allowed under federal law currently remains at 10% ethanol for all other vehicles. EPA required that fuel and fuel additive manufacturers take certain steps before introducing gasoline containing 15% ethanol (&#8220;E15&#8221;) into the market, including developing and obtaining EPA approval of a plan to minimize the potential for E15 to be used in vehicles and engines not covered by the partial waiver. EPA has taken several recent actions to authorize the introduction of E15 into the market, including approving, on June 15, 2012, the first plans to minimize the potential for E15 to be used in vehicles and engines not covered by the partial waiver, followed by approving, on February 7, 2013, a new blender pump configuration for general use by retail stations that wish to dispense E15 and gasoline containing 10% ethanol (&#8220;E10&#8221;) from a common hose and nozzle. Existing laws and regulations could change, and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum fuels may increase. Because we do not produce renewable transportation fuels at all of our refineries, increasing the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into our products displaces an increasing volume of our Shreveport, Superior, Montana and San Antonio refineries&#8217; fuel products pool, potentially resulting in lower earnings and materially adversely affecting our ability to make payments on our debt obligations. 

Climate Change 

In response to findings by the EPA that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to the warming of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere and other climatic changes, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (&#8220;PSD&#8221;) construction and Title V operating permit program requiring reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions will also be required to meet &#8220;best available control technology&#8221; standards, which will be established by the states or, in some instances, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, on December 23, 2010, the EPA entered a settlement agreement with environmental groups requiring the agency to propose by December 10, 2011, GHG New Source Performance Standards (&#8220;NSPS&#8221;) for refineries and to finalize these rules by November 15, 2012. To date, the EPA has not completed those rulemakings, and we do not know when they will be completed. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the U.S., including petroleum refineries, on an annual basis. We monitor for and report upon GHG emissions at our facilities, where required. These EPA policies and rulemakings or any new administrative legal requirements could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities. 

In addition, from time to time Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHG, and a number of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHG, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. On an international level, the U.S. is one of almost 200 nations that agreed on December 12, 2015, to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France, that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets. It is not possible at this time to predict how or when the U.S. might impose legal requirements as a result of this international agreement. The adoption of any legislation or regulations that requires reporting of GHG or otherwise limits emissions of GHG from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHG associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the refined petroleum products that we produce. For example, on August 18, 2015, the EPA published a proposed rule that will establish emission standards for methane and volatile organic compounds released from new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmissions facilities, as part of President Obama&#8217;s Administration&#8217;s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The EPA is expected to finalize those rules in 2016. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the earth&#8217;s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations. 

Hazardous Substances and Wastes 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), also known as the &#8220;Superfund&#8221; law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Such classes of persons include the current and past owners and operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released and companies that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations, such as landfills. Under CERCLA, these &#8220;responsible persons&#8221; may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances into the environment. In the course of our operations, we generate wastes or handle substances that may be regulated as hazardous substances, and we could become subject to liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws. 

We also may incur liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;), and comparable state laws, which impose requirements related to the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. In the course of our operations, we generate petroleum product wastes and ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. In addition, our operations also generate non-hazardous solid wastes, which are regulated under RCRA and state laws. Historically, our environmental compliance costs under the existing requirements of RCRA and similar state and local laws have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and the cost involved in complying with these requirements is not material. 

We currently own or operate, and have in the past owned or operated, properties that for many years have been used for refining and terminal activities. These properties have in the past been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes were not under our control. Although we used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes have been released on or under the properties owned or operated by us. These properties and the materials disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination. 

In addition, new laws and regulations, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, increased governmental enforcement or other developments could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. For example, in 2012, the EPA published final amendments to the NSPS for petroleum refineries, including standards for emissions of nitrogen oxides from process heaters and work practice standards and monitoring requirements for flares. 

Remediation of subsurface contamination is in process at certain of our refinery sites and is being overseen by the appropriate state agencies. Based on current investigative and remedial activities, we believe that the soil and groundwater contamination at these refineries can be controlled or remedied without having a material adverse effect on our financial condition. However, such costs are often unpredictable and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the future costs will not become material. 

Water Discharges 

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the federal Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and stringent controls on the discharge of pollutants, including oil, into federal and state waters. Such discharges are prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the appropriate state agencies. Any unpermitted release of pollutants, including crude oil or hydrocarbon specialty oils as well as refined products, could result in penalties, as well as significant remedial obligations. Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture, or leak. The EPA retains jurisdiction over federal waters of the U.S. pursuant to the Clean Water Act and has published a final rule on June 29, 2015, that attempted to clarify this jurisdiction over such waters of the U.S.; however, this rule is alleged to have impermissibly broadened such jurisdiction and thus the rule is subject to various legal impediments, including formalized opposition, lawsuits and/or court stays. Historically, our environmental compliance costs under the existing requirements of the federal Clean Water Act and similar state laws have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

The primary federal law for oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (&#8220;OPA&#8221;), which addresses three principal areas of oil pollution &#8212; prevention, containment and cleanup. OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities and onshore facilities, including refineries, terminals and associated facilities that may affect waters of the U.S. Under OPA, responsible parties, including owners and operators of onshore facilities, may be subject to oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages from oil spills. Our past environmental compliance with OPA and similar state laws have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

Occupational Health and Safety 

We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety, including OSHA and comparable state laws. These laws and regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA&#8217;s hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, contractors, state and local government authorities and customers. We maintain safety and training programs as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We conduct periodic audits of Process Safety Management (&#8220;PSM&#8221;) systems at each of our locations subject to the PSM standard. Our compliance with applicable health and safety laws and regulations has required, and continues to require, substantial expenditures. Changes in occupational safety and health laws and regulations or a finding of non-compliance with current laws and regulations could result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses, as well as civil penalties and, in the event of a serious injury or fatality, criminal charges. 

We have completed studies to assess the adequacy of our PSM practices at our Shreveport refinery with respect to certain consensus codes and standards. During the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we incurred approximately $0.6 million &#32;and $1.1 million , respectively, of related capital expenditures and expect to incur up to $1.4 million &#32;of capital expenditures during 2016 to address OSHA compliance issues identified in these studies. We expect these capital expenditures will enhance our equipment such that the equipment maintains compliance with applicable consensus codes and standards. 

In the first quarter of 2011, OSHA conducted an inspection of the Cotton Valley refinery&#8217;s PSM program. On March 14, 2011, OSHA issued a Citation and Notification of Penalty (the &#8220;Cotton Valley Citation&#8221;) to us as a result of our Cotton Valley inspection, which included a proposed penalty amount of $0.2 million . We have contested the Cotton Valley Citation and have reached a tentative settlement with OSHA on the matter, which we do not believe will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 

Other Environmental and Maintenance Items 

We perform preventive and normal maintenance on most, if not all, of our refining and terminal assets and make repairs and replacements when necessary or appropriate. We also conduct inspections of these assets as required by law or regulation. 

Insurance 

Our operations are subject to certain hazards of operations, including fire, explosion and weather-related perils. We maintain insurance policies, including business interruption insurance for each of our facilities, with insurers in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we, with the advice of our insurance advisors and brokers, believe are reasonable and prudent. We cannot, however, ensure that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal and property damage or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices. We are not fully insured against certain risks because such risks are not fully insurable, coverage is unavailable, or premium costs, in our judgment, do not justify such expenditures. 

Seasonality 

The operating results for the fuel products segment, including the selling prices of asphalt products we produce, generally follow seasonal demand trends. Asphalt demand is generally lower in the first and fourth quarters of the year, as compared to the second and third quarters, due to the seasonality of the road construction and roofing industries we supply. Demand for gasoline and diesel is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in highway traffic. In addition, our natural gas costs can be higher during the winter months, as demand for natural gas as a heating fuel increases during the winter. As a result, our operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters may be lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year due to seasonality related to these and other products that we produce and sell. &#32; 

The operating results for the oilfield services segment follow seasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the performance and delivery of our oilfield services and products. The severity and duration of the winter can have a significant impact on drilling activity. Additionally, customer spending patterns for other oilfield services and products can result in lower activity in the fourth calendar quarter. &#32; 

Properties 

We own and lease the principal properties which are listed below. The principal properties which we own, among others not listed below, are pledged as collateral under our Collateral Trust Agreement as discussed in Part II, Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8212; Debt and Credit Facilities.&#8221; We believe that all properties are suitable for their intended purpose, are being efficiently utilized and provide adequate capacity to meet demand for the next several years.
