Description of Business 

Nature of Business and Organization 

We are a leading global operator of regulated exchanges, clearing houses and listings venues, and a provider of data services for commodity and financial markets. We operate regulated marketplaces for trading and clearing a broad array of derivatives and securities contracts across major asset classes, including energy and agricultural commodities, interest rates, equities, equity derivatives, credit derivatives, bonds and currencies. 

Our exchanges include futures exchanges in the United States, or U.S., United Kingdom, or U.K., continental Europe, Canada and Singapore and cash equities exchanges and equity options exchanges in the U.S. We operate over-the-counter, or OTC, markets for physical energy and credit default swaps, or CDS. We operate central counterparty clearing houses serving the global derivatives markets in the U.S., U.K., continental Europe, Canada and Singapore (Note 12). In addition, we offer a range of data and connectivity services to our global financial and commodity markets and clearing houses. Following our December 2015 acquisition of Interactive Data Holdings Corporation, or Interactive Data, our suite of data products includes an expanded range of fixed income pricing and reference data, analytics and trading service offerings. Through our trading, clearing, listings, data services and post-trade platforms, we bring together buyers and sellers by offering liquid markets, benchmark products, access to capital markets, information, and a range of related services to support market participants&#8217; investing, risk management and capital raising activities.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The consolidated financial statements include our wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions between our wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. As discussed in Note 3, we completed several acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;and have included the financial results of these companies in the consolidated financial statements effective from the respective acquisition dates, including Interactive Data on December 14, 2015 and NYSE Holdings LLC, or NYSE, on November 13, 2013. As discussed in Note 16, we completed the initial public offering, or IPO, of our wholly-owned subsidiary Euronext N.V., or Euronext, in June 2014 and completed the sales of Wombat in July 2014 and NYFIX and Metabit in September 2014, and have included the financial results of these companies in discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. 

Comprehensive Income 

Other comprehensive income includes changes in unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments classified as available-for-sale, changes in fair value of net investment hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments and amortization of the difference in the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation associated with benefit plan liabilities, net of tax. 

Non-controlling Interest 

For those consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100% and for which we have control over the assets and liabilities and the management of the entity, the outside stockholders&#8217; interests are shown as non-controlling interests. For instances where outside stockholders&#8217; hold an option to require us to repurchase the outside stockholders&#8217; interest, these interests are shown as redeemable non-controlling interests. 

Segment and Geographic Information 

We currently operate as a single reportable business segment as this is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviews and operates the business. Substantially all of our identifiable assets are located in the U.S., U.K., Continental Europe, Asia, Israel and Canada. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

We consider all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities at the purchase date of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Short-Term and Long-Term Restricted Cash and Investments 

We classify all cash and cash equivalents and investments that are not available for immediate or general business use by us as restricted in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (Note 4). The restricted cash would include cash set aside due to regulatory requirements, earmarked for specific purposes, or through restrictions in specific agreements. 

Short-Term and Long-Term Investments 

We periodically invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in term deposits and investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities (Note 5). These investments are classified as available-for-sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We do not have any investments classified as held-to-maturity or trading. Additionally, we classify equity and fixed income mutual funds, held for the purpose of providing future payments for the supplemental executive savings plan and a component of the supplemental executive retirement plan, as available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair value using primarily quoted prices in active markets for identical securities, with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale investments, are recognized currently in earnings. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Investments that we intend to hold for more than one year are classified as long-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

Cost and Equity Method Investments 

We use the cost method to account for a non-marketable equity investment in an entity that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over an entity&#8217;s operating and financial policies. When we do not have a controlling financial interest in an entity but exercise significant influence over the entity's operating and financial policies, such investment is accounted for using the equity method. We recognize dividend income when declared. We recognized $16 million , $23 million , and $8 million &#32;in dividend income for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to our investment in Cetip (Note 15). 

Margin Deposits and Guaranty Funds 

Original margin, variation margin and guaranty funds held by our clearing houses for clearing members may be in the form of cash, government obligations, certain agency and corporate debt, letters of credit or gold (Note 12). Cash original margin, variation margin and guaranty fund deposits are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as current assets and current liabilities. The amount of margin deposits on hand will fluctuate over time as a result of, among other things, the extent of open positions held at any point in time by market participants in contracts and the margin rates then in effect for such contracts. Non-cash original margin and guaranty fund deposits are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These non-cash assets are held in safekeeping and our clearing houses do not take legal ownership of the assets as the risks and rewards remain with the clearing members, unless and until such time as a clearing member defaults on its obligations to the clearing house. 

Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment is recorded at cost, reduced by accumulated depreciation (Note 6). Depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, or in the case of leasehold improvements, the shorter of the initial lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement. We review the remaining estimated useful lives of our property and equipment at each balance sheet date and will make adjustments to the estimated remaining useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining useful lives have changed. Gains on disposals of property and equipment are included in other income and losses on disposals of property and equipment are included in depreciation expense. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that we believe to be sufficient to absorb probable losses in our accounts receivable portfolio. The allowance is based on several factors, including a continuous assessment of the collectability of each account. In circumstances where a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations is known, we record a specific provision for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. Accounts 

receivable are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when collection efforts cease. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;(in millions):

Bad debt expense in the table above is based on our historical collection experiences and our assessment of the collectability of specific accounts. Charge-offs in the table above represent the write-off of uncollectible receivables, net of recoveries. These lines also include the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments. 

Software Development Costs 

We capitalize costs, both internal and external direct and incremental costs, related to software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with U.S. GAAP . Software development costs incurred during the preliminary or maintenance project stages are expensed as incurred, while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized using the straight-line method over the useful life of the software, not to exceed three years (except for Interactive Data's new platform, which has an eight year useful life). Amortization of these capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use. General and administrative costs related to developing or obtaining such software are expensed as incurred. 

Accrued Employee Benefits 

In connection with our acquisition of NYSE on November 13, 2013, we assumed the NYSE defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, or collectively &#8220;benefit plans&#8221;. We recognize the funded status of the benefit plans in the consolidated balance sheets, measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year-end, and provide additional disclosures in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements (Note 14). 

Benefit plan costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, mortality rates and other factors. Actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. We immediately recognize in the consolidated statements of income certain of these unrecognized amounts when triggering events occur, such as when a settlement of pension obligations in excess of total interest and service costs occurs. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other post-retirement obligations and future expense recognized. 

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets (Note 7). We recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired. Goodwill has been allocated to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing based on the portion of synergy, cost savings and other expected future cash flows expected to benefit the reporting units at the time of the acquisition. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The reporting units identified for our goodwill testing are the futures, cash listings and credit default swaps reporting units. Goodwill impairment testing is performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the asset may be impaired. 

We also evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the asset may be impaired. Such evaluation includes either applying the optional qualitative screen to determine if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the asset continues to exceed its carrying value or determining the fair value of the asset and comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference. 

For both goodwill and indefinite lived impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that this is the case, we must perform additional testing of the asset or reporting unit. Otherwise, no further testing is necessary. 

We did not record an impairment charge related to goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;or 2013 . 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets 

We review our property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. To analyze recoverability, we project undiscounted net future cash flows over the remaining life of such assets. If these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment indicator would exist. The impairment loss is measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets. Finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis or using an accelerated method over the lesser of their contractual or estimated useful lives. We did not record an impairment charge related to long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;or 2013 . 

Derivatives and Hedging Activity 

We may use derivative instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. All derivatives are required to be recorded at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of such derivative financial instruments are recognized in net income as they are not designated as hedges under U.S. GAAP. 

From time to time, we may hedge the foreign currency translation of certain net investments by designating all or a portion of certain financial liabilities denominated in the same currency in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In such cases, the gain or loss on the currency translation of the designated financial instruments is recorded in other comprehensive income. Gains and losses on financial liabilities designated as hedging items under net investment hedging relationships are recognized in other comprehensive income, and we recorded a loss of $19 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2013 related to these items. The total unrealized loss of $21 million &#32;(inclusive of $2 million &#32;in unrealized losses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014) was recognized in earnings as a component of income from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2014 upon discontinuance of the net investment hedge in connection with the IPO of Euronext. 

Intellectual Property 

All costs related to internally developed patents and trademarks are expensed as incurred. All costs related to purchased patents, trademarks and internet domain names are recorded as other intangible assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. All costs related to licensed patents are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license. 

Income Taxes 

We recognize income taxes under the liability method. We recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect. 

We do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. 

We are subject to tax in numerous domestic and foreign jurisdictions primarily based on our operations in these jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 

Revenue Recognition 

We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sale price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Our revenues primarily consist of transaction and clearing fee revenues for transactions executed and/or cleared through our global electronic derivatives trading and clearing platforms, revenues relating to cash equities trading and listing fees, and data services fees. We also evaluate all contracts in order to determine appropriate gross versus net revenue reporting. 

Derivatives trading and clearing revenues are recognized over the period in which the services are provided, which is typically the date the transactions are executed or are cleared, except for a portion of clearing revenues related to cleared contracts which have an ongoing clearing obligation that extends beyond the execution date. The transaction and clearing fee revenues are determined on the basis of the transaction and clearing fee charged for each contract traded on the exchanges. Derivatives transaction and clearing fees are recorded net of rebates of $563 million , $466 million &#32;and $497 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volumes by providing qualified trading participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. These rebates reduce revenue that we would have generated had we charged full transaction fees and had we generated the same volume without the rebate program. The increase in rebates is due primarily to rebates relating to NYSE derivatives trading and clearing following our acquisition, an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts, an increase in the number of rebate programs offered and from higher contract volume traded under these programs during the periods. 

Cash trading fee revenues are paid by organizations based on their trading activity. Fees are assessed on a per share basis for trading in equity securities. The fees are applicable to all transactions that take place on any of our equity trading venues, and the fees vary based on the size and type of trade that is consummated and trading venue. The equity trading venues earn transaction fees for customer orders of equity securities matched internally, as well as for customer orders routed to other exchanges. Cash trading fees are recognized as earned, which is generally upon execution of the trade. Cash trading fees are recorded gross of liquidity rebates and routing charges. Liquidity payments made to cash and options trading customers and routing charges made to other exchanges are included in transaction-based expenses in the consolidated statements of income. 

Listing fee revenues consist of original listing fees paid by issuers to list the initial securities on the various cash markets, other listing fees related to other corporate actions (including stock splits, sales of additional securities and merger and acquisitions), annual listing fees paid by companies whose financial instruments are listed on the cash markets, and other services provided to our listed companies and other companies. Original listing fees are assessed primarily based on the number of shares that the issuer initially lists. Original listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated service periods ranging from 5 &#32;to 9 years. Other corporate action listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated service periods ranging from 3 &#32;to 6 &#32;years. The service periods are determined separately for each of our listing venues. Annual listing fees are billed at the beginning of the year and are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. We determined that at the time of the acquisition of NYSE, we did not have a legal performance obligation relating to the original and other listing fees. Therefore, in connection with purchase accounting rules under U.S. GAAP, we assigned a fair value of zero to the NYSE unamortized deferred revenue balances relating to the original and other listing fees as of the acquisition date of November 13, 2013. The listing fees unamortized deferred revenue balances as of December 31, 2015 &#32;relate to original and other corporate action listing fees received but not yet recognized as revenue subsequent to the November 13, 2013 acquisition through December 31, 2015 &#32;(Note 8). 

Data services fee revenues in our derivatives markets primarily include terminal and license fees received from data vendors in exchange for the provision of real-time futures price information and market data access fees. Market data fees are charged to data vendors on a monthly basis based on the number and type of terminals they have carrying futures data. Each data vendor also pays an annual license fee, which is deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the period of the annual license. Data services fee revenues also include market data access fees charged to customers that trade on the electronic platform. The market data access amount for each company is based on the number of users at each company trading on the electronic platform. The excess of the market data access fee total for each company over the actual amount of commissions paid for trading activity is recognized as market data access revenues. The actual amount of commissions paid that month for trading activity is recognized as transaction and clearing fee revenues. 

We collect market data revenues from our cash equity and options consortium-based data products and, to a lesser extent, for New York Stock Exchange proprietary data products. Consortium-based data fees are determined by securities industry plans. Consortium-based data revenues that coordinated market data distribution generates (net of administration costs) are distributed to participating markets on the basis of the Regulation NMS formula. We collect annual license fees from vendors for the right to distribute market data to third parties and a service fee from vendors for direct connection to market data. These fees are recognized as revenue as services are rendered. We also charge customers for accessing our data services through Secured Financial Transaction Infrastructure, or SFTI, and colocation services. SFTI is a physical network infrastructure that connects our markets and other major market centers with market participants and allows those participants to receive data feeds. Data analytics includes a number of products such as forward curves, index and valuation services. 

Revenue for subscription based contracts is recognized ratably over the life of the contract and revenue for usage based contracts is recognized in the month that the products/services are provided. Certain of our businesses collect fees for installation/set-up services which, if deemed a separate deliverable with standalone value, are recognized upon delivery as long as the remaining criteria for recognition of revenue have been achieved. Revenue for installation/set-up services, that do not meet the criteria for separation, is recognized ratably either over the contractual term or the expected client relationship life. Revenue for professional services is recognized as the services are provided. Revenue for hardware is recognized when installation is completed and the related services go-live. 

Some contracts include multiple elements for which we determine whether the various elements meet the applicable criteria to be accounted for as separate elements and makes estimates regarding the relative fair values. Revenue for elements that cannot be separated is recognized once the revenue recognition criteria for the entire arrangement have been met or over the period that our obligation to perform is fulfilled. Consideration for elements that are deemed separable is allocated to the separate elements at the inception of the arrangement on the basis of their relative selling price and recognized based on meeting authoritative criteria to do so. 

Other revenues primarily consist of various fees for services provided to our customers, including fees for facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, ICE Endex membership fees, agricultural grading and certification fees, regulatory penalties and fines, and interest income on certain clearing margin deposits. These fees are recognized as revenue as services are rendered. 

Activity Assessment Fees and Section 31 Fees 

We pay the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, fees pursuant to Section 31 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for transactions executed on our U.S. equities and options exchanges. These Section 31 fees are designed to recover the costs to the government for supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals. We (or the Options Clearing Corporation on our behalf), in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in transaction and clearing fees in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the U.S. equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts as revenue when invoiced. Fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semiannually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. The activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the Section 31 fees paid by us to the SEC. As a result, Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

We currently sponsor employee and director stock option and restricted stock plans (Note 10). U.S. GAAP requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options and restricted stock, based on estimated fair values. U.S. GAAP requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated financial statements. 

We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for purposes of valuing stock option awards. Our determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These variables include interest rates, our expected dividend yield, our expected share price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior. 

Treasury Stock 

We record treasury stock activities under the cost method whereby the cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury stock (Note 10). Our accounting policy upon the formal retirement of treasury stock is to deduct the par value from common stock and to reflect any excess of cost over par value as a deduction from additional paid-in capital (to the extent created by previous issuances of the shares) and retained earnings. 

Credit Risk and Significant Customers 

Our clearing houses have credit risk for maintaining certain of the clearing member cash deposits at various financial institutions (Note 12). Cash deposit accounts are established at larger money center banks and structured to restrict the rights of offset or liens by the banks. Our clearing houses monitor the cash deposits and mitigate credit risk by keeping such deposits in several financial institutions, ensuring that its overall credit risk exposure to any individual financial institution remains within acceptable concentration limits, and by ensuring that the financial institutions have strong or high investment grade ratings. We also limit our risk of loss by holding the majority of the cash deposits in high quality short-term sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements with several different counterparty banks or direct investments in short-term high quality sovereign and supranational debt issues. While we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. As the clearing houses may pass on interest revenues, minus costs, to the members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. 

When engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying securities in custody accounts under clearing house control. Additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. The typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% &#32;of the reverse repurchase amount. Thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse 

repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of securities with a value potentially greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty&#8217;s obligation to the clearing house. 

ICE Clear Credit has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the Financial Stability Oversight Council and has been authorized to establish and maintain a cash account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Such account was opened on July 30, 2015 and it is intended to decrease ICE Clear Credit's custodial, liquidity and operational risk as compared to alternative custodial and investment arrangements. 

Our futures businesses have minimal credit risk as all of their transaction revenues are currently cleared through our clearing houses. Our accounts receivable related to market data revenues, cash trading and listing revenues, technology revenues, CDS transaction revenues and bilateral over-the-counter energy transaction revenues subjects us to credit risk, as we do not require these customers to post collateral. We limit our risk of loss by terminating access to trade to entities with delinquent accounts. The concentration of risk on accounts receivable is also mitigated by the large number of entities comprising our customer base. 

Our accounts receivable are stated at cost. Excluding clearing members, there were no individual accounts receivable balances greater than 10% of total consolidated accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015 &#32;or December 31, 2014 . No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated revenues during any of the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;or 2013 . 

Leases 

We expense rent from non-cancellable operating leases, net of sublease income, on a straight-line basis based on future minimum lease payments. The net costs are included in rent and occupancy expenses and technology and communication expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (Note 13). 

Acquisition-Related Transaction and Integration Costs 

We incur incremental direct acquisition-related transaction costs relating to various completed and potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support growth. The acquisition-related transaction costs include fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, deal-related bonuses to certain of our employees, as well as costs associated with credit facilities and other external costs directly related to the proposed or closed transactions. We also incurred integration costs during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 relating to our NYSE acquisition, primarily related to employee termination costs, costs incurred relating to the IPO and sale of Euronext in Europe and the sale of NYSE Technologies, deal related bonuses, lease termination costs and professional services costs incurred relating to the NYSE integration. 

The acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily relate to the integration costs incurred for our NYSE integration and the acquisition-related transaction costs related to our Interactive Data and Trayport acquisitions. The acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily relate to the integration costs incurred for our NYSE integration and the acquisition-related transaction costs related to our SuperDerivatives, ICE Futures Singapore, ICE Clear Netherlands and True Office acquisitions. The acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relate to the costs incurred for our NYSE acquisition and integration and our ICE Endex acquisition. See Note 3 for additional information on our acquisitions. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

We apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (Note 15). Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, short-term and long-term investments, customer accounts receivable, margin deposits and guaranty funds, cost and equity method investments, short-term and long-term debt and other short-term assets and liabilities. 

Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments and Foreign Currency Transaction Gains and Losses 

Our functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. We have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in certain U.K., continental European, Asian and Canadian subsidiaries. The revenues, expenses and financial results of these subsidiaries are recorded in the functional currency of the countries that these subsidiaries are located in, which are primarily pounds sterling and euros. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses, net of tax, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. As of December 31, 2015 &#32; 

and 2014 , the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from foreign currency translation adjustments was $(45) million &#32;and $13 million , respectively. 

We have foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros. The transaction gain and losses are due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. Forward contracts on foreign currencies are entered into to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and resulted in net losses of $14 million , $2 million &#32;and $2 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Earnings Per Common Share 

Basic earnings per common share is calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during the year. Common equivalent shares from stock options and restricted stock awards, using the treasury stock method, are included in the diluted per share calculations unless the effect of inclusion would be antidilutive (Note 19). 

Recently Adopted and New Accounting Pronouncements 

In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, &#32;or ASU 2015-03. This standard amends the existing guidance to require that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of as a deferred asset. The amortization of the debt issuance costs will continue to be expensed as interest expense over the term of the related debt. ASU 2015-03 will be effective on a retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. We decided to early adopt ASU 2015-03 on a retrospective basis for the annual period ended December 31, 2015 and the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 9 for disclosure and related impact to the consolidated financial statements under this new guidance. 

In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Deferral of the Effective Date , or ASU 2015-14. This standard defers the guidance in ASU 2014-09, Revenue From Contracts with Customers , by one year. ASU 2015-14 requires these new revenue recognition rules to become effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this amendment but we currently do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, or ASU 2015-17. ASU 2015-17 is part of the FASB&#8217;s simplification initiative aimed at reducing complexity in accounting standards. This new standard requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 will be effective on a retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, but early adoption is permitted. We decided to early adopt ASU 2015-17 on a retrospective basis for the annual period ended December 31, 2015 and the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 11 for deferred taxes disclosure and related impact to the consolidated financial statements under this new guidance. 

Reclassifications 

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year&#8217;s financial statement presentation, including for the implementation of ASU 2015-14 and ASU 2015-17, discussed above. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we have reclassified $131 million &#32;and $14 million , respectively, of transaction based expenses in transaction and clearing fees, net to transaction based expenses. The amounts reclassified to transaction based expenses relate to certain derivative transactions.

Acquisitions 

Interactive Data Acquisition 

On December 14, 2015, we acquired 100% &#32;of Interactive Data in a stock and cash transaction. The total purchase price was $5.6 billion &#32;comprised of cash consideration of $4.1 billion &#32;and 6.5 million &#32;shares of our common stock. The cash consideration is gross of $301 million &#32;of cash held by Interactive Data on the date of the acquisition. Of the cash consideration, $2.6 billion &#32;was paid to retire Interactive Data's outstanding debt (Note 9). The fair value of the shares issued was $1.6 billion &#32;based on the average share price of our common stock of $244.48 &#32;per share on December 14, 2015. The cash consideration was funded from $2.5 billion &#32;of net proceeds received on November 24, 2015 in connection with the offering of new senior notes and $1.6 billion &#32;of borrowing under our 

commercial paper program (Note 9). We valued the shares issued for the acquisition using a volume-weighted average share price as the acquisition closed during the trading day on December 14, 2015. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase business combination. 

Interactive Data is a leading provider of financial market data, analytics and related trading solutions, serving the mutual fund, bank, asset management, hedge fund, securities and financial instrument processing and administration sectors. The acquisition builds on our global market data growth strategy by expanding the markets served, adding technology platforms and increasing new data and valuation services. Our combined company will offer customers efficiencies in accessing data on an integrated platform while serving the growing demand for data, analysis, valuation and connectivity globally. 

The total purchase price was allocated to Interactive Data&#8217;s preliminary tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of those assets as of December 14, 2015, as set forth below. The excess of the purchase price over the preliminary net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill and we are currently in the process of assigning the acquired goodwill to our reporting units. Goodwill represents potential revenue synergies related to new product development, expense synergies related to technology and opportunities to enter new markets. The fair value of accounts receivable acquired is not materially different than the contractual value. The preliminary purchase price allocation is as follows (in millions):

In performing the preliminary purchase price allocation, we considered, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of Interactive Data's business. We have not yet obtained all of the information related to the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities related to the acquisition to finalize the purchase price allocation. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the valuation of the identifiable intangible assets, property and equipment, income taxes (including uncertain tax positions) and certain other tangible assets and liabilities. The allocation of the purchase price will be finalized upon the completion of the analysis of the acquired assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2016. 

The following table sets forth the components of the preliminary intangible assets associated with the acquisition as of December 31, 2015 (in millions, except years):

&#160; 

Preliminary acquisition-date identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of intangibles derived from customer relationships, developed technology, in-process research and development, data/databases, trade names and trademarks, market data provider relationships and non-compete agreements. An average 25 -year useful life for customer relationships has been estimated based on the projected economic benefits associated with this asset. The average 25 -year estimated useful life represents the approximate point in the projection period in which a majority of the asset&#8217;s cash flows are expected to be realized based on assumed attrition rates. 

Developed technology represents completed software related to internal and external software platforms. In-process research and development represents the value assigned to acquired research and development projects that, as of the acquisition date, had not established technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The in-process research and development intangible assets are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets and are subject to impairment testing until completion or 

abandonment of the projects. Upon successful completion of each project and launch of the product, we will make a separate determination of useful life of the in-process research and development intangible assets and the related amortization will be recorded as an expense over the estimated useful life of the specific projects. 

Data/databases represents the underlying current and historical market data relating to daily pricing, intraday pricing and the evaluations and reference data. Market data provider relationships represents the unique relationships that Interactive Data has with exchanges and brokers worldwide. A 3 -year estimated useful life has been assigned for Interactive Data trade names and trademarks based on their estimated continued use following the acquisition. 

The customer relationship intangible asset was valued using the multi period excess earnings method, the market data provider relationships and data/databases intangible assets were valued using the replacement cost approach, the trade names and trademarks and the developed technology (including in-process research and development) intangible assets were valued using the relief from royalty income approach, and the non-compete agreements were valued using the with and without method within the income approach. The intangible assets will be amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Preliminary identifiable intangible assets acquired in the Interactive Data transaction that are subject to amortization will have a weighted average useful life of 23 &#32;years. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the Interactive Data results of operations and cash flows for the period from December 15, 2015 through December 31, 2015. Total revenues of $46 million &#32;and income from continuing operations of $5 million &#32;are included in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2015 relating to Interactive Data, subsequent to our acquisition. 

Trayport Acquisition 

On December 11, 2015, we acquired 100% &#32;of Trayport in a stock transaction. The total purchase price was $620 million , comprised of 2.5 million &#32;shares of our common stock based on the average share price of our common stock of $245.26 &#32;per share on December 11, 2015. We valued the shares issued for the acquisition using a volume-weighted average share price as the acquisition closed during the trading day on December 11, 2015. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase business combination. 

Trayport is a software company that licenses its technology to serve exchanges. OTC brokers and traders to facilitate electronic and hybrid trade execution primarily in the energy markets. The transaction is expected to enable us to provide new technology and software-related services to our energy customers. 

The total purchase price was allocated to Trayport&#8217;s preliminary tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of those assets as of December 11, 2015, as set forth below. The excess of the purchase price over the preliminary net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill and we are currently in the process of assigning goodwill to our reporting units. Goodwill represents potential revenue synergies related to new product development opportunities to enter new markets. The fair value of accounts receivable acquired is not materially different than the contractual value. The preliminary purchase price allocation is as follows (in millions):

Preliminary acquisition-date identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of intangibles derived from customer relationships, developed technology and trade names and trademarks. A 20 -year useful life for customer relationships has been estimated based on the projected economic benefits associated with this asset. The 20 -year estimated useful life represents the approximate point in the projection period in which a majority of the asset&#8217;s cash flows are expected to be realized based on assumed attrition rates. Developed technology represents completed software related to internal and external software platforms. Indefinite useful lives have been assigned for the Trayport trade names and trademarks based on their long history in the marketplace, their continued use following the acquisition, and their importance to the business and prominence in the industry. 

The customer relationships intangible asset was valued using the multi period excess earnings method, and the developed technology and the trade names and trademarks intangible assets were valued using the relief from royalty income approach. The intangible assets will be amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, except for the trade names and trademarks, which have indefinite lives. Preliminary identifiable intangible assets acquired in the Trayport transaction that are subject to amortization will have a weighted average useful life of 19 &#32;years. 

NYSE Acquisition 

On November 13, 2013, we acquired 100% of NYSE in a stock and cash transaction. The total purchase price was $11.1 billion &#32;comprised of cash consideration of $2.7 billion &#32;and 42.4 million &#32;shares of our common stock. The fair value of the shares issued was $8.3 billion &#32;based on the closing share price of our common stock of $197.80 &#32;per share on November 12, 2013. The cash consideration was funded from cash on hand, $1.4 billion &#32;of net proceeds received on October 8, 2013 in connection with the offering of senior notes and $400 million &#32;of borrowings on October 31, 2013 under our revolving facility (Note 9). 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the NYSE results of operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , and for the period from November 13, 2013 through December 31, 2013. Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses of $208 million &#32;and NYSE income from continuing operations of $30 million &#32;are included in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2013, subsequent to its acquisition. We have incurred employee termination costs following the acquisition, which are included in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, including $21 million , $99 million &#32;and $44 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively.

Other Acquisitions 

On October 7, 2014, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of SuperDerivatives, a leading provider of risk management analytics, financial market data and valuation services for $358 million &#32;in cash, of which $44 million &#32;is currently held in escrow (Note 4). The acquisition is intended to accelerate our multi-asset class clearing, risk management and market data strategy. 

On February 3, 2014, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Singapore Mercantile Exchange (which has been renamed ICE Futures Singapore). The acquisition included Singapore Mercantile Exchange Clearing Corporation (which has been renamed ICE Clear Singapore), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICE Futures Singapore, which was the clearing house for all of its trades. ICE Futures Singapore operates commodity futures markets in Singapore. ICE Futures Singapore and ICE Clear Singapore retain licenses to operate as an approved exchange and an approved clearing house, regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. These licenses provided us with exchange and clearing licenses in Asia. 

On December 2, 2014, we acquired 75% &#32;of the outstanding common stock of Holland Clearing House (which has been renamed ICE Clear Netherlands) to support our clearing strategy for financial products. ABN AMRO Clearing Bank N.V., or ABN AMRO, retained the remaining 25% &#32;minority interest in ICE Clear Netherlands. ICE Clear Netherlands is a continental European derivatives clearing house based in Amsterdam and is the primary clearing house for The Order Machine, or TOM, a multi-lateral trading facility for equity options. ICE Clear Netherlands is regulated and supervised in the Netherlands by the Authority for the Financial Markets and the Dutch Central Bank and is also European Market Infrastructure Regulation, or EMIR, authorized. ABN AMRO's 25% &#32;ownership has been recorded as &#8220;redeemable non-controlling interest&#8221; in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Short-Term and Long-Term Restricted Cash and Investments 

We own ICE Futures Europe, which operates as a U.K. Recognized Investment Exchange. As a U.K. Recognized Investment Exchange, ICE Futures Europe is required by the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. to restrict the use of the equivalent of six &#32;months of operating expenditures, subject to certain deductions, in cash or cash equivalents or investments at all times. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , this amount for ICE Futures Europe was $57 million . Such amounts are reflected as short-term restricted cash and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

We own LIFFE Administration and Management, or Liffe, which also operates as a U.K. Recognized Investment Exchange. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the six &#32;months of operating expenditures for Liffe was $106 million &#32;and $114 million , respectively. Such amounts are reflected as short-term restricted cash and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In November 2014, we completed the transition of Liffe&#8217;s contracts to ICE Futures Europe. While Liffe still has a regulated status as of December 31, 2015, we have applied for a de-recognition order, which will result in the release of the $106 million &#32;in regulatory capital and an increase in our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents when approved. 

As a U.K. Recognized Clearing House, ICE Clear Europe is required by the Bank of England to restrict the use of the equivalent of six &#32;months of operating expenditures, subject to certain deductions, in cash or cash equivalents or investments at all times. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , this amount for ICE Clear Europe was $87 million . As of December 31, 2014 the $87 million &#32;was reflected as short-term restricted cash and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. When EMIR becomes effective, which is currently anticipated during the first half of 2016, the Bank of England restricted cash capital requirements for ICE 

Clear Europe will be superseded by the EMIR capital requirements, which would require liquid regulatory capital requirements of $274 million . We have funded the entire $274 million &#32;of cash in ICE Clear Europe as of December 31, 2015 and it was reflected as short-term restricted cash and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 

Our Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, regulated U.S. Designated Contract Market, or DCM, ICE Futures U.S., our CFTC regulated U.S. Derivatives Clearing Organizations, or DCOs, ICE Clear U.S. and ICE Clear Credit, our CFTC regulated U.S. Swap Data Repository, or SDR, ICE Trade Vault, and our U.S. Swap Execution Facility, or SEF, ICE Swap Trade are required to maintain financial resources with a value at least equal to the amount that would cover certain operating costs for a one -year period, including maintaining cash or a committed line of credit, subject to certain deductions, to satisfy at least six months of such operating costs at all times. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the financial resources reserved necessary to satisfy such operating costs for these DCM, DCOs, SDR and SEF were $142 million &#32;and $49 million , respectively, in the aggregate, of which $7 million &#32;was satisfied by our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2014. A portion of such revolving credit facility has historically been reserved for use by certain of our DCOs for liquidity purposes (Note 9). As of December 31, 2015, we no longer reserved any of our revolving credit facility for use by our DCOs for liquidity purposes. The remaining $142 million &#32;and $42 million &#32;of the financial resources as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, was recorded as short-term restricted cash and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

ICE Clear Europe, in addition to being regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England once EMIR is effective, is also regulated by the CFTC as a DCO. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the financial resources reserved necessary to satisfy such operating costs for ICE Clear Europe as a CFTC DCO was $139 million &#32;and $107 million , respectively. No additional amounts were recorded for these amounts in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as they were already included as restricted cash as part of the EMIR financial resources requirements as of December 31, 2015 and part of the Financial Conduct Authority or revolving credit facility financial resources requirements as of December 31, 2014. 

Our clearing houses require that each clearing member make deposits to a fund known as the guaranty fund. The amounts in the guaranty fund will serve to secure the obligations of a clearing member to our clearing houses and may be used to cover losses in excess of the margin and clearing firm accounts sustained by our clearing houses in the event of a default of a clearing member. ICE Clear Europe has contributed $100 million &#32;of its own cash as part of its futures and options guaranty fund and this cash is reflected as long-term restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . ICE Clear Europe has also contributed $50 million &#32;and $28 million &#32;of its own cash as part of its CDS guaranty fund as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, and this cash is reflected as long-term restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. ICE Clear Credit has contributed $50 million &#32;of its own cash as part of its CDS guaranty fund as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;and this cash is reflected as long-term restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. ICE Clear U.S. has contributed $50 million &#32;of its own cash as part of its futures and options guaranty fund as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;and this cash is reflected as long-term restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. See Note 12 for additional information on the guaranty funds and our contributions of cash to our clearing houses guaranty funds. 

ICE Clear Netherlands, as a continental European derivatives clearing house, is regulated and supervised in the Netherlands by the Authority For the Financial Markets and the Dutch Central Bank and is required to maintain regulatory capital equal to various solvency and risk based calculations, subject to EMIR minimum regulations. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the regulatory capital for ICE Clear Netherlands was $11 million &#32;and $12 million , respectively, and is reflected as short-term restricted cash and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Our contribution to the guaranty fund of ICE Clear Netherlands as of December 31, 2014 was $24 million &#32;and is reflected as long-term restricted cash and investments. During the year ended December 31, 2015, there was a change in the ICE Clear Netherlands clearing fund rules and our contribution to the guaranty fund was no longer required. 

As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , there is $13 million &#32;and $6 million , respectively, of additional combined cash reflected as short-term restricted cash and investment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to other regulated entities and exchanges, included ICE Benchmark Administration, ICE Trade Vault U.K., ICE Endex and ICE Clear Singapore. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , there is $44 million &#32;of cash held as escrow for the SuperDerivatives acquisition that is reflected as short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the escrow could be held for up to 18 &#32;months from the date of our October 7, 2014 acquisition.

We acquired 31.6 million &#32;shares, or 12% , of the common stock of Cetip for an aggregate consideration of $514 million &#32;in cash in July 2011. We account for our investment in Cetip as an available-for-sale investment and we classify it as a long-term investment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the fair value of the equity security investment was $299 million &#32;and $379 million , respectively. The balance as of December 31, 2015 &#32;includes an unrealized loss of $25 million &#32;from our new cost basis. Our investment in Cetip was made in, and the shares are valued in, Brazilian reais. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income, and include the effects of both stock price and foreign currency translation fluctuations. The unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income until realized. Realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary, are recognized in earnings. 

During the year ended December 31, 2013 , we recognized an impairment loss on our Cetip investment of $190 million , primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes, which was equal to the difference between the $324 million &#32;fair value as of December 31, 2013 &#32;and the original investment cost of $514 million . The $324 million &#32;fair value of the Cetip investment as of December 31, 2013 &#32;became the new cost basis of the investment and the new cost basis will not be adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value. The $190 million &#32;impairment loss was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss and was recognized in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2013 . 

We concluded that the accumulated unrealized loss of $25 million &#32;in the investment in Cetip as of December 31, 2015 was not other than temporary as the loss was solely due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the share price of Cetip has increased, the short duration of the loss and our ability to hold the investment until it recovers in value. 

Upon closing of the Euronext IPO, we received &#8364;1.4 billion &#32;( $1.9 billion ) in net cash proceeds. We elected to set aside sufficient euro-denominated cash from the proceeds to effectively pre-fund the maturity of the NYSE EUR Notes and the related final interest coupon payment, both due on June 30, 2015 (Note 9). In connection with this, in July 2014, we placed &#8364;969 million &#32;( $1.2 billion ) of the cash proceeds from the Euronext IPO in term deposits at various banks each with a maturity date of June 25, 2015 to cover the &#8364;920 million &#160;( $1.1 billion ) principal and the &#8364;49 million &#32;( $60 million ) final interest coupon payment due on June 30, 2015. These deposits were classified as short-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 . The decrease in our short-term investments as of December 31, 2015 &#32;was due to the use of the short-term euro-denominated term deposit investments to repay the NYSE EUR Notes upon their maturity on June 30, 2015. 

Equity and fixed income mutual funds are held for the purpose of providing future payments for the supplemental executive savings plan and the supplemental executive retirement plan (Note 14) are classified as available-for-sale securities. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we were holding $449 million &#32;in U.S. Treasury securities, all of which had original maturities of less than one year from the date of purchase. Of these securities, $25 million &#32;were recorded as cash and cash equivalents (all of which have original maturities of less than 90 days), $274 million &#32;were recorded as short-term restricted cash and investments and $150 million &#32;were recorded as long-term restricted cash and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 . As of December 31, 2014 , we were holding $374 million &#32;in U.S. Treasury securities, all of which had original maturities of less than one year from the date of purchase. Of these securities, $159 million &#32;were recorded as cash and cash equivalents (all of which have original maturities of less than 90 days), $87 million &#32;were recorded as short-term restricted cash and investments and $128 million &#32;were recorded as long-term restricted cash and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 . We account for the U.S. Treasury securities held using the available-for-sale method.

For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , amortization of software and internally developed software was $89 million , $81 million &#32;and $48 million , respectively, and depreciation of all other property and equipment was $124 million , $138 million &#32;and $40 million , respectively. The unamortized software and internally developed software balances were $171 million &#32;and $141 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. The increase in the property and equipment as of December 31, 2015 is primarily due to the property and equipment acquired in the Interactive Data and Trayport acquisitions (Note 3), internally developed software and building improvements at the corporate headquarters in Atlanta and New York during the year ended December 31, 2015.

Senior Notes 

On November 24, 2015, we issued $2.5 billion &#32;in aggregate senior notes, including $1.25 billion &#32;principal amount of 2.75% &#32;senior unsecured fixed rate notes due November 2020, or the 2020 Senior Notes, and $1.25 billion &#32;principal amount of 3.75% &#32;senior unsecured fixed rate notes due November 2025, or the 2025 Senior Notes. We used the net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes offering, together with $1.6 billion &#32;of borrowings under our Commercial Paper Program, to finance the $4.1 billion &#32;cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of Interactive Data (Note 3). The 2020 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes contain affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, certain redemption rights, limitations on liens and 

indebtedness, limitations on certain mergers, sales, dispositions and lease-back transactions. Interest on the 2020 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes will be payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2016. 

In October 2013, we issued $600 million &#32;principal amount of 2.50% &#32;senior unsecured fixed rate notes due October 2018, or the 2018 Senior Notes, and $800 million &#32;principal amount of 4.00% &#32;senior unsecured fixed rate notes due October 2023, or the 2023 Senior Notes. We used the net proceeds from the 2018 Senior Notes and 2023 Senior Notes offering to finance, together with cash on hand and $400 million &#32;borrowed in October 2013 under the Revolving Facility, the $2.7 billion &#32;cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of NYSE (Note 3). The 2018 Senior Notes and 2023 Senior Notes contain affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, certain redemption rights, limitations on liens and indebtedness, limitations on certain mergers, sales, dispositions and lease-back transactions. 

Credit Facilities 

In April 2014, ICE, as parent borrower, and our subsidiary ICE Europe Parent Limited, as subsidiary borrower, entered into a $3.0 billion &#32;senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the 2014 Credit Facility, pursuant to a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or Wells Fargo, as administrative agent, issuing lender and swing line lender, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, and the lenders party thereto. The 2014 Credit Facility was scheduled to end on April 3, 2019. 

Of the amounts available under the 2014 Credit Facility, we previously reserved $303 million &#32;to provide liquidity or required financial resources for the operations of our clearing houses. This amount included $150 million &#32;for ICE Clear Europe, $100 million &#32;for ICE Clear Credit, $50 million &#32;for ICE Clear U.S., and $3 million &#32;for ICE Clear Canada. During the fourth quarter of 2015, after additional contributions to the capital of the respective clearing houses, the respective clearing houses determined their own resources to be sufficient and available such that the supplemental amounts previously reserved under the 2014 Credit Facility were no longer required to provide liquidity or required financial resources for their operations (Note 4). 

In November 2015, we agreed with a majority of the lenders under the 2014 Credit Facility to amend certain terms of the 2014 Credit Facility. The amendments include, but not limited to, extending the maturity date to November 13, 2020 and increasing the ratio level in the maximum total leverage ratio covenant from 3.25:1.00 to 3.75:1.00 beginning with the first fiscal quarter ending after the consummation of the Interactive Data acquisition until the first fiscal quarter ending after the first anniversary of the acquisition. In addition, ICE Europe Parent Limited no longer has the ability to borrow amounts under the 2014 Credit Facility. The 2014 Credit Facility, as amended, is referred to herein as the &#8220;Amended Credit Facility.&#8221; 

The Amended Credit Facility includes an option for us to propose an increase in the aggregate amount available for borrowing by up to $1.0 billion , subject to the consent of the lenders funding the increase and certain other conditions. On November 13, 2015, we utilized this option to increase the amount of the Amended Credit Facility to $3.4 billion . The commitments under the Amended Credit Facility will automatically reduce to $2.95 billion &#32;on April 3, 2019. No amounts were outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility as of December 31, 2015. 

Amounts borrowed under the Amended Credit Facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. The Amended Credit Facility provides for a $3.4 billion &#32;multi-currency revolving facility, with sub-limits for non-dollar borrowings and letters of credit and with a swing-line facility available on a same-day basis. Of the $3.4 billion &#32;that is available for borrowing under the Amended Credit Facility, $2.6 billion &#32;is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2015. The amount required to back-stop the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. The remaining $809 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 is available to us to use for working capital and general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, acting as a back-stop to the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program. 

Borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility will bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either (a) LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate or (b) a &#8220;base rate&#8221; plus an applicable margin rate; provided, however, that all loans denominated in a foreign currency will bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate. The &#8220;base rate&#8221; equals the higher of (i) Wells Fargo&#8217;s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% , or (iii) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.00% . The applicable margin rate is based upon our public long term debt ratings and ranges from 0.875% &#32;to 1.50% &#32;on LIBOR borrowings and from 0.00% &#32;to 0.50% &#32;on base rate borrowings. 

The Amended Credit Facility includes an unutilized revolving credit commitment fee that is equal to the unused maximum revolver amount, multiplied by an applicable commitment fee rate and is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. The applicable commitment fee rate ranges from 0.08% &#32;to 0.20% &#32;and is determined based on our long term debt rating. As of December 31, 2015, the applicable commitment fee rate was 0.125% &#32;based on our current long term debt ratings. 

The Amended Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including a leverage ratio, as well as limitations on liens on our assets, indebtedness of non-obligor subsidiaries, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and other matters. 

In November 2011, we entered into senior unsecured credit facilities in the aggregate amount of $2.6 billion , or the 2011 Credit Facilities. The 2011 Credit Facilities consisted of (i) an aggregate $500 million &#32;five-year senior unsecured term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility, and (ii) an aggregate $2.1 billion &#32;five-year senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Facility. 

In October 2013, we borrowed $900 million &#32;under the Revolving Facility, of which $400 million &#32;was used to pay the cash portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of NYSE while the remaining $500 million &#32;was used to pay off the outstanding commercial paper obligations of NYSE, as well as to fund certain deal related fees and expenses. In December 2013, we repaid the $900 million &#32;borrowed under the Revolving Facility with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and with cash on hand. 

In connection with us entering into the 2014 Credit Facility in April 2014, the 2011 Credit Facilities were terminated and the $367 million &#32;outstanding under the Term Loan Facility was repaid through the issuance of commercial paper. No amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Facility when it was terminated. 

Commercial Paper Program 

In December 2013, we entered into a U.S. dollar commercial paper program, or the Commercial Paper Program. Our Commercial Paper Program is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the Amended Credit Facility, equal to the amount of the commercial paper that is issued and outstanding at any given point in time. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short term interest rates (such as USD LIBOR). The fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may impact our interest expense. 

We used net proceeds from notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2015 to finance part of the cash portion of the purchase price of Interactive Data and to pay related fees and expenses, to repurchase our common stock, and for general corporate purposes. We used net proceeds from notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2014 to repay the $367 million &#32;that was outstanding under the Term Loan Facility upon termination of the Term Loan Facility in April 2014, to fund certain of our acquisitions, and to repurchase our common stock. We repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2014 using a combination of the cash proceeds received from the IPO and sale of Euronext, the sale of NYSE Technologies (Note 16) and cash flows from operations. We used the net proceeds from the notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2013, along with cash on hand, to repay the $900 million &#32;borrowed under the Revolving Facility and the $450 million &#32;borrowed under the 2013 364 Day Facility. 

Commercial paper notes of $2.6 billion &#32;with original maturities ranging from 2 &#32;to 89 &#32;days were outstanding as of December 31, 2015 &#32;under the Commercial Paper Program. As of December 31, 2015 , the weighted average interest rate on the $2.6 billion &#32;outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program was 0.60% &#32;per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 19 &#32;days. Commercial paper notes of $905 million &#32;with original maturities ranging from 2 &#32;to 82 &#32;days were outstanding as of December 31, 2014 &#32;under the Commercial Paper Program. As of December 31, 2014 , the weighted average interest rate on the $905 million &#32;outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program was 0.26% &#32;per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 24 &#32;days. 

364 Day Facilities 

On November 13, 2015, we entered into a $500 million &#32;364 day senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the 2015 364 Day Facility, pursuant to a credit agreement with Wells Fargo, as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, and the lenders signatory thereto. The amounts available under the 2015 364 Day Facility are available for use by us for working capital and general corporate purposes but specifically excluding any use to back-stop amounts issued under the Commercial Paper Program. The commitments under the 2015 364 Day Credit Facility will be automatically reduced to $375 million &#32;on May 13, 2016 and to $250 million &#32;on August 13, 2016. Borrowings under the 2015 364 Day Facility will bear interest on the principal amount outstanding under the same terms as the Amended Credit Facility disclosed above. 

The 2015 364 Day Facility includes an unutilized revolving credit commitment fee that is equal to the unused maximum revolver amount, multiplied by an applicable commitment fee rate and is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. The applicable commitment fee rate ranges from 0.07% &#32;to 0.175% &#32;and is determined based on our long term debt rating. As of December 31, 2015, the applicable commitment fee rate was 0.10% &#32;based on our current long term debt ratings. 

In July 2013, we entered into a $600 million &#32;364 day senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the 2013 364 Day Facility. The 2013 364 Day Facility was available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In October 2013, we borrowed $450 million &#32;under the 2013 364 Day Facility to fund the prepayment of the Private Senior Notes. In December 2013, we repaid the $450 million &#32;borrowed under the 2013 364 Day Facility with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. In connection with us entering into the 2014 Credit Facility, the 2013 364 Day Facility was terminated in April 2014, at which time no &#32;amounts were outstanding. 

NYSE Notes 

In connection with the acquisition of NYSE, one of our subsidiaries assumed the outstanding NYSE debt instruments, which included $850 million &#32;of 2.0% &#32;senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in October 2017, or the NYSE USD Notes, and &#8364;920 million &#32;( $1.1 billion ) of 5.375% &#32;senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in June 2015, or the NYSE EUR Notes, and together with the NYSE USD Notes, the NYSE Notes. 

On June 30, 2015, we repaid the NYSE EUR Notes using cash that had been set aside in July 2014 from the proceeds of the Euronext IPO. The cash, in the amount of &#8364;969 million &#32;( $1.2 billion ) had been placed in term deposits that matured on June 25, 2015. The cash was sufficient to settle the principal maturity of &#8364;920 million &#160;( $1.1 billion ) and the final interest coupon of &#8364;49 million &#32;( $60 million ). These deposits are classified as short-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014. 

During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the amortization of the increase in the fair value of the NYSE Notes that was recorded in connection with the NYSE acquisition purchase accounting was $23 million , $55 million &#32;and $7 million , respectively. No further amortization expense was recorded after the repayment of the NYSE EUR Notes. 

The terms of the bonds do not contain any financial covenants. The bonds may be redeemed by us or the bond holders under certain customary circumstances, including a change in control accompanied by a downgrade of the bonds below an investment grade rating. The terms of the bonds also provide for customary events of default and a negative pledge covenant. 

Private Senior Notes 

Simultaneous with entering into the 2011 Credit Facilities in November 2011, we also entered into a note purchase agreement with various institutional investors providing for the sale of $400 million &#32;aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $200 million &#32;of our 4.13% &#32;Senior Notes, Tranche A, due November 9, 2018 and $200 million &#32;of our 4.69% &#32;Senior Notes, Tranche B, due November 9, 2021, or collectively, the Private Senior Notes. &#32; 

In October 2013, following the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes, we prepaid the $400 million &#32;aggregate principal amount of Private Senior Notes. In connection with the early payoff of the Private Senior Notes, we incurred $51 million &#32;in expenses relating to a $49 million &#32;pre-payment to the Private Senior Notes investors and an associated $2 million &#32;write off of the related debt issuance costs. The $51 million &#32;expense was recorded as other expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2013. To fund the prepayment of the Private Senior Notes and the associated pre-payment, we borrowed $450 million &#32;in October 2013 under the 2013 364 Day Facility.

Debt Issuance Cost Presentation 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, which amends the existing guidance to require that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of as a deferred asset (Note 2). We decided to early adopt ASU 2015-03 on a retrospective basis for the annual period ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, there are $27 million &#32;in debt issuance costs shown above as a deduction of the carrying value of the related debt liability or facilities, including $19 million &#32;relating to the 2020 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes. The $27 million &#32;in debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2015 &#32;will be amortized over a weighted average life of 6.9 &#32;years as interest expense. The retrospective adoption resulted in $12 million &#32;of debt issuance costs being reclassified from prepaid and other current assets and other non-current assets to a deduction of the carrying value of long-term debt as of December 31, 2014. 

Interactive Data Debt Retirement 

At the date of the acquisition, Interactive Data had $2.6 billion &#32;of outstanding debt consisting of $1.9 billion &#32;under a credit facility, or the Interactive Data Credit Facility, and $700 million &#32;of senior notes, or the Interactive Data Senior Notes, all of which were repaid from the cash portion of the purchase price. In connection with the closing of the acquisition on December 14, 2015, the Interactive Data Credit Facility was repaid and terminated. 

On December 7, 2015, Interactive Data issued a notice of redemption with respect to the Interactive Data Senior Notes. On December 14, 2015, an amount sufficient to fully redeem the Interactive Data Senior Notes, plus accrued interest, was deposited with the Interactive Data Senior Notes trustee in trust, solely for the benefit of the holders of the Interactive Data Senior Notes. As a result, the indentures governing the Interactive Data Senior Notes were satisfied and discharged. Neither the cash deposited into the trust or the Interactive Data Senior Notes have been reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as of the acquisition date or December 31, 2015. The trustee paid the full amount held in the trust to holders of the Interactive Data Senior Notes at the redemption date on January 6, 2016.

Equity 

We currently sponsor employee and director stock option and restricted stock plans. Employee and director stock-based compensation expenses and the related excess income tax benefit recognized for both stock options and restricted stock in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;was $111 million &#32;and $16 million , respectively, was $82 million &#32;and $28 million , respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014 , and was $56 million &#32;and $17 million , respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 . The amount expensed for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;is net of $11 million , $7 million &#32;and $7 million , respectively, of stock-based compensation that was capitalized as software development costs. 

During the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we recognized excess tax benefits of $19 million , $26 million &#32;and $8 million , respectively, as an increase to the additional paid-in capital balance. These amounts were qualifying excess tax benefits that are eligible to absorb future write-offs, if any, of unrealized deferred tax assets related to stock options. These amounts are reported as financing cash flows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. Regarding the ordering of tax benefits to determine whether an excess tax benefit is realized, as well as to measure that excess tax benefit, we follow applicable tax laws and disregard indirect effects of the excess tax benefit. 

In connection with the acquisition of NYSE, we assumed the obligations of the Intercontinental Exchange Holdings, Inc. and NYSE employee and director equity plans. As of December 31, 2015 , we had 3.5 million &#32;shares in total under various equity plans that are available for future issuance of our stock option and restricted stock awards. 

Stock Option Plans 

Stock options are granted at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors. All stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant as well as certain other assumptions. The fair value of the stock options on the date of grant is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. We may grant, under provisions of the plans, both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options. The options generally vest over three &#32;years, but can vest at different intervals based on the compensation committee&#8217;s determination. Generally, options may be exercised up to ten &#32;years after the date of grant, but expire either 14 &#32;or 60 days after termination of employment. The shares of common stock issued under our stock option plans are made available from authorized and unissued common stock or treasury shares. The following is a summary of stock options for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , which includes 3,644 &#32;stock options issued in connection with the NYSE acquisition:

The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;were $22 million , $39 million &#32;and $24 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2015 , there were $7 million &#32;in total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 &#32;years as the stock options vest. 

Of the options outstanding at December 31, 2015 , 539,973 &#32;were exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $139.36 . Of the options outstanding at December 31, 2014 , 561,844 &#32;were exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $116.64 . Of the options outstanding at December 31, 2013 , 689,046 &#32;were exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $90.43 . 

We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for purposes of valuing stock option awards. During the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we used the weighted-average assumptions in the table below to compute the value of all options for shares of common stock granted to employees:

The risk-free interest rate is based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected life computation is derived from historical exercise patterns and anticipated future patterns. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our stock. For the year ended December 31, 2013, expected dividend yields were 0% since prior to the November 2013 acquisition of NYSE, we had not contemplated paying dividends. Our current dividend policy will impact the expected dividend yield on all stock options granted post-acquisition. 

Restricted Stock Plans 

Restricted stock units are granted at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors. Excluding our restricted stock issued in connection with the NYSE acquisition in 2013, discussed below, we granted 691,518 , 560,380 &#32;and 586,317 &#32;time-based and performance-based restricted stock units during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, including 374,357 , 385,897 &#32;and 249,670 &#32;time-based restricted stock units during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. The grant date fair value of each award is based on the closing stock price at the date of grant. The fair value of the time-based restricted stock units on the date of grant is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period, which is typically three years, net of forfeitures. Granted but unvested shares are generally forfeited upon termination of employment. When restricted stock is 

forfeited, compensation costs previously recognized for unvested shares are reversed. Until the shares vest and are issued, the participants have no voting or dividend rights and the shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered. Following the NYSE acquisition and in connection with our dividend declaration policy, unvested restricted stock is now subject to earn dividend equivalents which are paid in cash on the vesting date. 

We recognize compensation costs, net of forfeitures, using an accelerated attribution method over the vesting period for awards with performance conditions. Compensation costs for such awards are recognized only if it is probable that the condition will be satisfied. If we initially determine that it is not probable that the performance condition will be satisfied and later determine that it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied, or vice versa, the effect of the change in estimate is accounted for in the period of change by recording a cumulative catch-up adjustment to retroactively apply the new estimate. We recognize the remaining compensation costs over the remaining vesting period. Our compensation committee, pursuant to the terms of the equity plans and the authority delegated to it by our board of directors, can make equitable adjustments to the performance condition in recognition of unusual or non-recurring events. 

In January 2016, we reserved a maximum of 330,924 &#32;restricted shares for potential issuance as performance-based restricted shares to certain of our employees. The number of shares that will ultimately be granted under the performance awards will be based on our actual financial performance as compared to financial performance targets set by our board of directors and compensation committee for the year ending December 31, 2016. These restricted shares are also subject to a market condition that could reduce the number of shares that are ultimately granted. The reduction would occur if our 2016 total shareholder return falls below the 2016 return of the S&#38;P 500 Index and we achieve an above &#8220;target&#8221; financial performance level threshold. If our 2016 total shareholder return were to fall below the 2016 return of the S&#38;P 500 Index, the reduction would be either 10% or 20% of the number of shares granted, depending on the difference in the aforementioned returns (the &#8220;market condition&#8221;). 

The grant date of this award was January 14, 2016, which was the date when we and our employees reached a mutual understanding of award terms. January 14, 2016 is also the service inception date as that is the date when the requisite service period began. The maximum compensation expense to be recognized under these performance-based restricted shares is $80 million &#32;if the maximum financial performance target is met and all 330,924 &#32;shares vest. The compensation expense to be recognized under these performance-based restricted shares will be $40 million &#32;if the target financial performance is met, which would result in 165,462 &#32;shares vesting. We will recognize expense on an accelerated basis over the three -year vesting period based on our quarterly assessment of the probable 2016 actual financial performance as compared to the 2016 financial performance targets. If the market condition is not achieved, compensation cost will not be affected since the grant date fair value of the award gave consideration to the probability of market condition achievement. 

In January 2015 , we reserved a maximum of 429,468 &#32;restricted shares for potential issuance as performance-based restricted shares for certain of our employees. These restricted shares were subject to a market condition that could have reduced the number of shares that were granted if our 2015 &#32;total shareholder return fell below that of the 2015 &#32;return of the S&#38;P 500 Index and if we achieved a &#8220;target&#8221; financial performance level or above. Our total shareholder return for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;was higher than the 2015 &#32;return of the S&#38;P 500 Index. Therefore, no additional share reduction was taken. Based on our actual 2015 &#32;financial performance as compared to the 2015 &#32;financial performance targets, 317,161 &#32;restricted shares were granted, which resulted in $63 million &#32;in compensation expenses that will be expensed over the three -year accelerated vesting period, including $37 million &#32;that was expensed during the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

During the fourth quarter of 2013, we reserved a maximum of 154,912 &#32;restricted shares for potential issuance as performance-based restricted shares for certain of our employees. The number of shares granted under the performance awards will be based on our actual financial performance as compared to financial performance targets set by our board of directors and compensation committee for the three years ending December 31, 2016. The maximum compensation expense to be recognized under these performance-based restricted shares is $31 million &#32;if the maximum financial performance target is met and 154,912 &#32;shares vest. We will recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the three -year vesting period based on our quarterly assessment of the probable three-year actual financial performance as compared to the financial performance targets. Through December 31, 2015, we determined that it is probable that the maximum financial performance will be met, and based on this assessment, we recorded non-cash compensation expense of $10 million &#32;and $9 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

The grant date fair values of the awards with a market condition were estimated based on our stock price on the grant date, the valuation of historical awards with market conditions, the relatively low likelihood that the market condition will affect the number of shares granted (as the market condition only affects shares granted in excess of certain financial performance targets), and our expectation of achieving the financial performance targets. The grant date fair value of the awards, when considering the impact of the market condition on fair value, was determined to not be materially different from our stock price on the respective grant dates. 

We assumed the NYSE equity plans, including certain unvested restricted stock awards of NYSE into our stock award plans as of the date of the NYSE acquisition in November 2013. As a result, we exchanged our restricted stock for NYSE restricted stock. We issued 239,488 &#32;unvested time-based restricted stock awards to NYSE employees and will recognize non-cash compensation expense on a straight-line basis as the awards vest based on the fair value of the awards on the consummation date of the transaction. These 

239,488 &#32;restricted stock shares issued are included in the table below as being granted during the year ended December 31, 2013, at a weighted average grant-date fair value of $197.80 &#32;per share. 

Restricted shares are used as an incentive to attract and retain qualified employees and to increase shareholder returns with actual performance-based awards based on enhanced shareholder value. Our equity plans include a change in control provision that may accelerate vesting on both the time-based and performance-based restricted shares if the awards are not assumed by an acquirer in the case of a change in control. The following is a summary of the nonvested restricted shares under all plans discussed above for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 : &#160;

Restricted stock shares granted in the table above include both time-based and performance-based grants. Performance-based shares have been adjusted to reflect the actual shares to be issued based on the achievement of past performance targets. As of December 31, 2015 , there were $112 million &#32;in total unrecognized compensation costs related to the time-based restricted stock and the performance-based restricted stock. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.3 &#32;years as the restricted stock vests. During the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the total fair value of restricted stock vested under all restricted stock plans was $96 million , $138 million &#32;and $62 million , respectively. 

Treasury Stock 

During the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we received 195,859 &#32;shares, 240,676 &#32;shares and 430,677 shares, respectively, of common stock from certain of our employees related to tax withholdings made by us on our employee&#8217;s behalf for restricted stock and stock option exercises. We recorded the receipt of the shares as treasury stock. Treasury stock activity is presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in equity, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and redeemable non-controlling interest. 

In connection with the acquisition of NYSE on November 13, 2013, all shares of common stock held by Intercontinental Exchange Holdings, Inc. immediately prior to the acquisition as treasury shares were canceled and extinguished and no consideration was delivered for the treasury shares. Therefore, on November 13, 2013, 7,560,480 &#32;treasury stock shares were retired. In connection with the retirement, of the $741 million &#32;value assigned to the treasury stock shares, $541 million &#32;was allocated to additional paid-in capital and $200 million &#32;was allocated to retained earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital was determined based on the paid-in capital per share generated from the historical issuances of these treasury shares. 

Stock Repurchase Program 

During the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we repurchased 2,868,769 &#32;shares and 3,231,484 &#32;shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $660 million &#32;and $645 million , respectively. These repurchases were completed under a stock repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors. The shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. We did not repurchase any shares during the year ended December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2015 , the remaining board authorization permits repurchases of up to $137 million &#32;of our common stock with no fixed expiration date. 

In September 2014, we entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan as authorized by our board of directors permitting open market repurchases of our common stock based on certain parameters described in the trading plan. In connection with our acquisition of 

Interactive Data during the fourth quarter of 2015, we suspended purchases under our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. The trading plan expired at the end of December 2015. The timing and extent of any future repurchases, if any, that are not made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon market conditions, the amount authorized by our board of directors, our stock price, our target debt ratio and corporate debt rating, and our strategic growth initiatives at that time. In addition, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time.

The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;are lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the favorable foreign income tax rate differential, partially offset by state income taxes. Favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result from lower income tax rates in the U.K., the Netherlands and various other lower tax jurisdictions than compared to the income tax rates in the U.S. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the U.K. reduced the corporate income tax rate from 20% &#32;to 19% &#32;effective April 1, 2017 and to 18% &#32;effective April 1, 2020. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with future U.K. income tax rate reductions (representing $60 million &#32;of the $61 million &#32;deferred tax benefit in the income tax provision table above) along with certain favorable settlements with various taxing authorities. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 is higher than the statutory federal rate primarily due to the favorable foreign income tax rate differential being largely offset by the non-tax deductible impairment loss on the Cetip investment (Note 5) along with state income taxes. 

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We decided to early adopt ASU 2015-17 retrospectively and classified all deferred taxes and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, as non-current on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 (Note 2). As a result of the early adoption of this new standard, we reclassified $90 million &#32;current deferred tax liabilities to non-current deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014. The following table reflected the requirements under ASU 2015-17 and summarizes the significant components of our deferred tax liabilities and assets as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;(in millions):

We recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $72 million &#32;and $75 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Increases charged to income tax expense in the table above relate to capital losses that we do not expect to be realizable in future periods. Increases charged against goodwill in the table above relate to loss carryforwards acquired that we do not expect to be realizable in future periods. Decreases in the table above relate to net operating loss carryforwards that we determined would be available to offset income in future periods. 

Our non-U.S. subsidiaries had $2.9 billion &#32;in cumulative undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2015 . This amount represents the post-income tax earnings under U.S. GAAP adjusted for previously taxed income. The earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Further, a determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability is not 

practicable. Any future distribution by way of dividend of these non-U.S. earnings may subject us to both U.S. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for non-U.S. tax credits, and withholding taxes payable to various non-U.S. countries. 

As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we have gross U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $340 million &#32;and $126 million , respectively, and gross state and local net operating loss carryforwards of $1.0 billion &#32;and $611 million , respectively. These carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income until they begin to expire in 2018. In addition, as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we have gross foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $105 million &#32;and $77 million , respectively, related primarily to net operating loss carryforwards acquired which have an indefinite life.

&#32;As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the balance of unrecognized tax benefits which would, if recognized, affect our effective tax rate was $80 million &#32;and $106 million , respectively. It is reasonably possible, as a result of settlements of ongoing audits or statute of limitations expirations, unrecognized tax benefits could increase as much as $16 million &#32;and decrease as much as $23 million &#32;within the next twelve months. Of the $107 million &#32;in unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2015 , $77 million &#32;is recorded as other non-current liabilities and $30 million &#32;is recorded as other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 

We recognize interest accrued on income tax uncertainties and accrued penalties as a component of income tax expense. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we recognized an income tax benefit of $12 million &#32;for interest and penalties, and for the years ended December 31, 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we recognized $4 million &#32;and $3 million , respectively, of income tax expense for interest and penalties. Accrued interest and penalties were $33 million &#32;and $45 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Of the $33 million &#32;in accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2015 , $13 million is recorded as other non-current liabilities and $20 million is recorded as other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 

We or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The following table summarizes open tax years by major jurisdiction:

Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, we believe that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have been provided for any adjustments expected to result from open tax years.

Clearing Organizations 

We operate regulated central counterparty clearing houses for the settlement and clearance of derivative contracts. The clearing houses include ICE Clear Europe, ICE Clear Credit, ICE Clear U.S., ICE Clear Canada, ICE Clear Netherlands and ICE Clear Singapore (referred to herein collectively as the &#8220;ICE Clearing Houses&#8221;). 

&#8226; 

ICE Clear Europe performs the clearing and settlement for all futures and options contracts traded through ICE Futures Europe and ICE Endex, for CDS contracts submitted for clearing in Europe and for energy futures and options contracts trading through ICE Futures U.S. 

&#8226; 

ICE Clear U.S. performs the clearing and settlement of agricultural, metals, currencies and financial futures and options contracts traded through ICE Futures U.S. 

&#8226; 

ICE Clear Canada performs the clearing and settlement for all futures and options contracts traded through ICE Futures Canada. 

&#8226; 

ICE Clear Singapore performs the clearing and settlement for all futures and options contracts traded through ICE Futures Singapore. 

&#8226; 

ICE Clear Credit performs the clearing and settlement for CDS contracts submitted for clearing in North America. 

&#8226; 

ICE Clear Netherlands offers clearing primarily for TOM (Note 3). 

Each of the ICE Clearing Houses requires all clearing members to maintain cash on deposit or pledge certain assets, which may include government obligations, non-government obligations, letters of credit or gold to guarantee performance of the clearing members&#8217; open positions. Such amounts in total are known as &#8220;original margin.&#8221; The ICE Clearing Houses may make intraday original margin calls in circumstances where market conditions require additional protection. The daily profits and losses from and to the ICE Clearing Houses due to the marking-to-market of open contracts is known as &#8220;variation margin&#8221;. The ICE Clearing Houses mark all outstanding contracts to market, and therefore pay and collect variation margin, at least once daily, and in some cases multiple times throughout the day. Marking-to-market allows the ICE Clearing Houses to identify any clearing members that may be unable to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of the ICE Clearing Houses to ensure financial performance of clearing members&#8217; open positions. 

Each of the ICE Clearing Houses requires that each clearing member make deposits into a fund known as a &#8220;guaranty fund&#8221;, which is maintained by the relevant ICE Clearing House. These amounts serve to secure the obligations of a clearing member to the ICE Clearing House to which it has made the guaranty fund deposit and may be used to cover losses sustained by the respective ICE Clearing House in the event of a default of a clearing member. 

Each of the ICE Clearing Houses has equal and offsetting claims to and from their respective clearing members on opposite sides of each cleared contract. This arrangement allows the ICE Clearing Houses to serve as the central financial counterparty on every cleared contract. Each ICE Clearing House bears financial counterparty credit risk in the event that market movements create conditions that lead to its clearing members failing to meet their financial obligations to that ICE Clearing House. Accordingly, the ICE Clearing Houses account for this central counterparty guarantee as a performance guarantee. Given that each contract is margined and marked-to-market or settled at least once daily for each clearing member, the ICE Clearing Houses&#8217; maximum estimated exposure for this guarantee, excluding the effects of original and variation margin requirements and mandatory deposits to the applicable guaranty fund by clearing members, is $76.1 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 , which represents the maximum estimated value by the ICE Clearing Houses of a hypothetical one day movement in pricing of the underlying unsettled contracts. This amount is based on calculations determined using proprietary risk management software that simulates gains and losses based on historical market prices, volatility and other factors present at that point in time for those particular unsettled contracts. Future actual market price volatility could result in the exposure being significantly different than the amount estimated by the ICE Clearing Houses. The net notional value of unsettled contracts was $2.4 trillion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . We performed calculations to determine the fair value of our counterparty performance guarantee taking into consideration factors such as daily settlement of contracts, margining requirements, other elements of our risk management program, historical evidence of default payments, and estimated probability of potential default payouts by the ICE Clearing Houses. Based on these analyses, the estimated counterparty performance guaranty liability was determined to be nominal and no liability was recorded as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

The ICE Clearing Houses seek to reduce their exposure through a risk management program that includes initial and ongoing financial standards for clearing member admission and continued membership, original and variation margin requirements, and mandatory deposits to the guaranty fund. The amounts that the clearing members are required to maintain in the original margin and guaranty fund accounts are determined by standardized parameters established by the risk management departments and reviewed by the risk committees and the boards of directors of each of the ICE Clearing Houses and may fluctuate over time. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the ICE Clearing Houses have received or have been pledged $87.2 billion &#32;and $77.0 billion , respectively, in cash and non-cash collateral in original margin and guaranty fund deposits to cover price movements of underlying contracts for both periods. The ICE Clearing Houses also have powers of assessment that provide the ability to collect additional funds from their clearing members to cover a defaulting member&#8217;s remaining obligations up to the limits established under the respective rules of each ICE Clearing House. 

Should a particular clearing member fail to deposit original margin, or fail to make a variation margin payment, when and as required, the relevant ICE Clearing House may liquidate or hedge the clearing member&#8217;s open positions and use the clearing member&#8217;s original margin and guaranty fund deposits to make up any amount owed. In the event that those deposits are not sufficient to pay the amount owed in full, the ICE Clearing Houses may utilize the respective guaranty fund deposits of their respective clearing members on a pro-rata basis for that purpose. 

We have contributed $150 million , $50 million &#32;and $50 million &#32;in cash to the ICE Clear Europe, ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear U.S. guaranty funds, respectively, as of December 31, 2015 , and such amounts are at risk and could be used in the event of a clearing member default where the amount of the defaulting clearing member&#8217;s original margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient. The $250 million &#32;combined contributions to the guaranty funds as of December 31, 2015 &#32;are included in long-term restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet (Note 4). 

The $50 million &#32;contribution to the ICE Clear U.S. guaranty fund would be utilized after the available funds of the defaulting clearing member but before all other amounts within the guaranty fund. For ICE Clear Europe, if a futures and options clearing member&#8217;s deposits are depleted and a default occurs, then a $100 million &#32;contribution made by us to the ICE Clear Europe guaranty fund would be utilized after the available funds of the defaulting clearing member but before all other amounts within the guaranty fund. The $100 million &#32;is solely available in the event of an ICE Clear Europe futures and options clearing member default. 

We have contributed $50 million &#32;to the ICE Clear Credit guaranty fund and $50 million &#32;to the ICE Clear Europe CDS guaranty fund. The first $25 million &#32;contributed to each of the ICE Clear Credit guaranty fund and ICE Clear Europe CDS guaranty fund will be utilized after the available funds of the defaulting CDS clearing member but before all other amounts within the guaranty funds. The additional $25 million &#32;contributed to each of the ICE Clear Credit guaranty fund and ICE Clear Europe CDS guaranty fund will be utilized pro-rata along with other non-defaulting CDS clearing members&#8217; deposits in the respective guaranty funds. Subject to regulatory approval, ICE Clear Europe plans to move the total $50 million &#32;contribution to the CDS guaranty fund to be utilized after the available funds of the defaulting clearing member but before all other amounts within the guaranty fund.

We have recorded these cash deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members of the relevant ICE Clearing House. All cash, securities and letters of credit are available only to meet the financial obligations of that clearing member to the relevant ICE Clearing House. ICE Clear Europe, ICE Clear Credit, ICE Clear U.S., ICE Clear Canada, ICE Clear Netherlands and ICE Clear Singapore are separate legal entities and are not subject to the liabilities of the other ICE Clearing Houses or the obligations of the members of the other ICE Clearing Houses. The amount of these cash deposits may fluctuate due to the types of margin collateral choices available to clearing members and the change in the amount of deposits required. As a result, these assets and corresponding liabilities may vary significantly over time. Except as noted below with respect to ICE Clear Credit, the majority of the cash held by the ICE Clearing Houses is secured in reverse repurchase agreements with primarily overnight maturities or direct investment in U.S. government securities. The remaining cash deposits at the ICE Clearing Houses are held in demand deposit accounts at large, highly rated financial institutions and directly in U.S. Treasury securities with original maturities of less than 12 months. 

Of the $31.0 billion &#32;of ICE Clear Europe cash deposits as of December 31, 2015 , which are primarily held in U.S. dollars, euros and pounds sterling, $25.0 billion &#32;relates to futures and options products and $6.0 billion &#32;relates to cleared OTC European CDS instruments. ICE Clear Europe offers a separate clearing platform, risk model and risk pool for futures and options products that is distinct from those associated with cleared OTC European CDS instruments. 

Of the $31.0 billion &#32;of ICE Clear Europe cash deposits as of December 31, 2015 , $22.6 billion &#32;represent funds invested under reverse repurchase agreements through third party investment and custody agents, with several different counterparty banks, some of which are also our clearing members and are large commercial financial institutions, and $8.2 billion &#32;represent funds invested directly in sovereign debt. Under these arrangements, ICE Clear Europe primarily purchases U.S. Treasury securities and certain sovereign debt obligations from the seven largest industrialized nations, and the various counterparties agree to repurchase the instruments on the 

set repurchase date at the set repurchase price, plus interest. The carrying value of these securities approximates their fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments and repurchase agreements. 

ICE Clear Credit has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the Financial Stability Oversight Council and has been authorized to establish and maintain a cash account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Such account was opened on July 30, 2015. Of the $15.8 billion &#32;of ICE Clear Credit cash deposits as of December 31, 2015 , $7.2 billion &#32;is held in the cash account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. An additional $5.7 billion &#32;represent funds invested under reverse repurchase agreements with several counterparty banks, which are all large commercial financial institutions. Under these arrangements, ICE Clear Credit purchases U.S. Treasury securities and other U.S. securities and the various counterparties agree to repurchase the instruments the following business day at a set price, plus interest. The remaining $2.9 billion &#32;in ICE Clear Credit cash deposits represent primarily euro cash in demand deposit accounts at large, highly-rated financial institutions. 

In addition to the cash deposits for original margin and the guaranty fund, the ICE Clearing Houses have also received other assets from clearing members, which may include government obligations, certain agency and corporate debt, letters of credit or gold to mitigate credit risk. These assets are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the risks and rewards of these assets remain with the clearing members unless the ICE Clearing Houses have sold or re-pledged the assets or in the event of a clearing member default, where the clearing member is no longer entitled to redeem the assets. Any income, gain or loss accrues to the clearing member. For certain non-cash deposits, the ICE Clearing Houses may impose discount or &#8220;haircut&#8221; rates to ensure adequate collateral levels to account for fluctuations in the market value of these deposits. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the assets pledged by the clearing members as original margin and guaranty fund deposits for each of the ICE Clearing Houses are detailed below (in millions):

Commitments and Contingencies 

Leases 

We lease office space, equipment facilities and certain computer equipment under lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2028. Our leases typically contain terms which may include renewal options, rent escalations, rent holidays and leasehold improvement incentives. We had no capital leases as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . Rental expense under these leases, included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in rent and occupancy and technology and communication expenses, totaled $60 million , $82 million &#32;and $47 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. As of December 31, 2015 , future minimum lease payments under these non-cancelable operating agreements are as follows (in millions): 2016

Redeemable Non-controlling Interest 

As part of the ICE Endex purchase agreement, Gasunie has a put option to sell to us, and we have a call option to purchase from Gasunie, Gasunie&#8217;s entire 21% &#32;remaining ownership in ICE Endex at fair market value provided that the fair value falls between a stated cap and floor. Both the call and put option became exercisable on March 26, 2015 and they both expire on March 26, 2018. As part of the ICE Clear Netherlands acquisition (Note 3), ABN AMRO has a put option to sell to us, and we have a call option to purchase from ABN AMRO, ABN AMRO&#8217;s entire remaining 25% &#32;ownership in ICE Clear Netherlands at fair market value subject to a stated floor. Both the call and put option become exercisable after the third anniversary of the date of closing of the acquisition. 

Since the likelihood of us acquiring both of the non-controlling interests in the future is probable, we have recorded the full redemption fair value of $35 million &#32;and $40 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, relating to ICE Endex and ICE Clear Netherlands as mezzanine equity and classified the related balance as &#8220;redeemable non-controlling interest&#8221; in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the proportionate share of profits was recorded as net income from continuing operations attributable to non-controlling interest in the consolidated statements of income. Changes in the redemption value of the non-controlling interest are recorded to the redeemable non-controlling interest balance in full as they occur. 

Prior to the our acquisition of NYSE, NYSE completed the sale of a significant equity interest in NYSE Amex Options, one of our two &#32;U.S. options exchanges, to seven &#32;external investors. Under the terms of the sale, the external investors had the option to require us to repurchase a portion of the equity interest on an annual basis. Since the likelihood of us acquiring the non-controlling interest was probable, the full redemption fair value had been recorded as mezzanine equity and the related balance as &#8220;redeemable non-controlling interest&#8221; in the consolidated balance sheets and the proportionate share of profits was recorded as net income from continuing operations attributable to non-controlling interest in the consolidated statements of income. In July 2014 we repurchased 16% &#32;of the interest held by the seven &#32;external investors for $129 million &#32;in cash, and in June 2015 we repurchased the remaining 16% &#32;of the interest for $128 million &#32;in cash. Effective from July 1, 2015, all of the profits from NYSE Amex Options are retained by us as we now own 100% of NYSE Amex Options. 

Legal Proceedings 

We are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the course of our business. Typically, we do not believe that the resolution of ordinary course matters, including the matters described below, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially and adversely affected by any developments relating to the legal proceedings and claims. The matters described below all relate to our operation of NYSE. A range of possible losses related to the cases below cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, except as otherwise disclosed below. 

In April 2014, the first of four purported class action lawsuits was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, or the Southern District, by the City of Providence, Rhode Island, against more than 40 defendants, including &#8220;Exchange Defendants&#8221;, &#8220;Brokerage Defendants&#8221; and &#8220;HFT (High Frequency Trading) Defendants&#8221;, which we refer to as the City of Providence lawsuit. New York Stock Exchange LLC and NYSE Arca, Inc., two of our subsidiaries, were among the named Exchange Defendants. On July 2, 2014, the court ordered the cases consolidated for all purposes, and appointed lead plaintiffs. On September 3, 2014, the lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting claims against only a subset of the original Exchange Defendants, including New York Stock Exchange LLC and NYSE Arca, Inc., and also asserting claims against Barclays PLC, or Barclays, a subsidiary of which operates an alternative trading system known as Barclays LX. The lead plaintiffs are suing on behalf of a class of &#8220;all public investors&#8221; who bought or sold stock from April 18, 2009 to the present on the U.S.-based equity exchanges operated by the remaining Exchange Defendants or on Barclays LX. The amended complaint asserts violations by all remaining Exchange Defendants of Sections 10(b) and 6(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, and seeks unspecified compensatory damages against all defendants, jointly and severally, as well as various forms of equitable relief. The defendants filed a motion on November 3, 2014 to dismiss the amended complaint. On November 24, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint asserting the same legal claims and substantially the same factual allegations. On January 23, 2015, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the second amended complaint. 

On August 26, 2015, the court issued an opinion and order granting the defendants&#8217; motions to dismiss and dismissing the second amended complaint in its entirety with prejudice. The court held that the plaintiffs had failed to sufficiently state a claim against the defendants under Sections 10(b) and 6(b) of the Exchange Act, and additionally that some of the claims against the exchanges were barred by the doctrine of self-regulatory organization immunity. On September 24, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the dismissal of the lawsuit. Briefing in the appeal is expected to occur during the first half of 2016. 

In May 2014, three purported class action lawsuits were filed in the Southern District by Harold Lanier against the securities exchanges that are participants in each of the three national market system data distribution plans - the Consolidated Tape Association/Consolidated Quotation Plan, the Nasdaq UTP Plan, and the Options Price Reporting Authority, or the Plans, - which are established under the Exchange Act and regulated by the SEC. On August 15, 2014, Lanier filed amended complaints in each of the three lawsuits but did not alter the named defendants. New York Stock Exchange LLC, NYSE Arca, Inc. and NYSE MKT LLC, which are our subsidiaries, are among the defendants named in one or more of the suits. Lanier is claiming to sue on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated subscribers to the market data disseminated by the Plans. Lanier&#8217;s allegations include that the exchange participants in the Plans breached agreements with subscribers by disseminating market data in a discriminatory manner in that other &#8220;preferred&#8221; customers allegedly received their data faster than the proposed class. The complaints seek, among other relief, unspecified compensatory damages, restitution of the putative class&#8217;s subscription fees paid to the defendants, disgorgement of the fees paid by the so-called preferred customers, and injunctive and declaratory relief. On September 29, 2014, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On April 28, 2015, the court issued an opinion and order granting the motion and dismissing the three lawsuits with prejudice. The court determined that the claims were preempted by a &#8220;comprehensive federal regulatory scheme&#8221;, and that in any 

event Lanier had failed to state a claim for breach of contract. On May 20, 2015, Lanier filed notices of appeal of the dismissal of the lawsuits. Briefing in the appeals is complete and oral argument is scheduled to occur on March 3, 2016. 

One of our subsidiaries, NYSE Brazil Holdings, B.V., or NYSE BV, was a party to an arbitration proceeding initiated by an arbitration demand dated June 4, 2014 in Brazil, filed by ATG Americas Trading Group, S.A. and ATS Brasil S.A., or ATG/ATS, which we refer to as the ATG/ATS arbitration proceeding. NYSE BV and ATG Americas Trading Group, S.A. own 20% &#32;and 80% , respectively, of the equity in ATS Brasil S.A., a company with a prospective cash equity trading platform in Brazil, which is not yet operational. ATG/ATS alleged NYSE BV breached certain obligations and asserted damages. On June 3, 2015, the arbitration panel granted a request by ATG/ATS to add NYSE Holdings LLC as a party to the arbitration, but denied its request to add any other alleged NYSE BV affiliates. In August 2015, NYSE BV and ATG/ATS settled the dispute and the arbitration panel terminated the arbitration proceeding. NYSE Holdings LLC was also released from any potential liability to ATG/ATS, although it never accepted the jurisdiction of the arbitration panel or formally appeared in the proceeding. The settlement expense for the ATG/ATS arbitration proceeding is recorded in other expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;in the accompanying consolidated statement of income. 

Tax Audits 

We are engaged in ongoing discussions and audits with taxing authorities on various tax matters, the resolutions of which are uncertain. Currently, there are matters that may lead to assessments involving us or one of our subsidiaries, some of which may not be resolved for several years. Based on currently available information, we believe we have adequately provided for any assessments that could result from those proceedings where it is more likely than not that we will be assessed. We continuously review our positions as these matters progress.

Pension and Other Benefit Programs 

Defined Benefit Pension Plan 

We have a pension plan covering certain of our U.S. operations. The pension plan was assumed in the NYSE acquisition. The benefit accrual for the pension plan is frozen. Retirement benefits are derived from a formula, which is based on length of service and compensation. Based on this calculation, we may contribute to our pension plan to the extent such contributions may be deducted for income tax purposes. During the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014, we contributed $10 million &#32;and $51 million , respectively, to our pension plan. Our practice is to fund our frozen defined benefit pension plan each year at the level above the minimum required contribution but within tax deductible limits. Based on actuarial projections, we estimate that a contribution of $10 million &#32;during the year ended December 31, 2016 will allow us to meet our funding goal. However, the actual contribution is contingent on the actual plan performance relative to assumptions. 

During year ended December 31, 2014 , as part of certain plan amendments, lump sum payments were offered to certain terminated vested participants as part of a de-risking strategy in the pension plans. The offer was made to 2,725 &#32;participants, of whom 935 , or 34% , elected to receive a lump sum. The total amount paid to this group was $55 million &#32;and when combined with other lump sum payments made during the year, it exceeded the total interest cost and service cost for the year. We recognized a loss of $4 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2014 &#32;in connection with these plan settlements, which is included in acquisition-related transaction and integration cost in our consolidated statement of income. 

We base our investment policy and objectives on a review of the actuarial and funding characteristics of the retirement plan, the demographic profile of plan participants, and our business and financial characteristics. Capital market risk/return opportunities and tradeoffs also are considered as part of the determination. The primary investment objective of our plan is to achieve a long-term rate of return that meets the actuarial funding requirements of the plan and maintain an asset level sufficient to meet all benefit obligations of the plan. The target allocations for the U.S. plan assets are 65 percent &#32;equity securities and 35 percent &#32;U.S. fixed income securities. Equity securities primarily include investments in large-cap and small-cap companies primarily located in the U.S., which include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries and U.S. treasuries. Based on the valuation techniques described in Note 15, the fair values of our pension plan assets as of December 31, 2015 , by asset category, are as follows (in millions):

We use a market-related value of plan assets when determining the estimated return on plan assets. Gains/losses on plan assets are amortized over a four year period and accumulate in other comprehensive income. We recognize deferred gains and losses in future net income based on a &#8220;corridor&#8221; approach, where the corridor is equal to 10% &#32;of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year.

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan 

We have a U.S. nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan, or SERP, which provides supplemental retirement benefits for certain employees. The future benefit accrual of the SERP plan is frozen. To provide for the future payments of these benefits, we have purchased insurance on the lives of certain of the participants through company-owned policies. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the cash surrender value of such policies was $51 million &#32;and $54 million , respectively, and is included in other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Pension and SERP Plans Assumptions

The assumed discount rate reflects the market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. The discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed on a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rates reflect the matching of plan liability cash flows to yield curves. To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio. 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we changed the method we use to estimate the interest component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. This change compared to the previous method will result in a decrease in the interest component of pension cost in 2016. Historically, we estimated the interest cost component utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. We have elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. We have made this change to provide a more precise measurement of interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. This change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations or our annual net periodic benefit cost as the change in the interest costs is completely offset in the actuarial (gain) loss reported. We have accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle and accordingly have accounted for it prospectively. We do not anticipate this change having a material impact on future period results. 

Post-retirement Benefit Plans 

Our defined benefit plans provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retired NYSE U.S. employees. These post-retirement benefit plans, which may be modified in accordance with their terms, are fully frozen. The net periodic post-retirement benefit costs were $8 million , $9 million &#32;and $1 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;and for the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013, respectively. The defined benefit plans are unfunded and we currently do not expect to fund the post-retirement benefit plans. The weighted average discount rate as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;is 4.1% &#32;and 3.8% , respectively. The following table shows the actuarial determined benefit obligation, interest costs, employee contributions, actuarial (gain) loss, benefits paid during the period and the accrued employee benefits (in millions):

Other Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution Plans 

The employees of our historical ICE U.S.-based subsidiaries are eligible to participate in a 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan, or the 401(k) Plan. We offer a match of 100% &#32;of the first 6% &#32;of the eligible employee&#8217;s compensation contributed to the 401(k) Plan, subject to plan and statutory limits. Total matching contributions under our 401(k) Plan were $7 million , $5 million &#32;and $4 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. No discretionary or profit sharing contributions were made during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;or 2013 . 

Our historical ICE U.K.-based subsidiaries have a defined contribution pension plan for eligible employees. We contribute a percentage of the employee&#8217;s base salary to the plan each month and employees are also able to make additional voluntary contributions, subject to plan and statutory limits. Our contribution ranges from 10% &#32;to 20% &#32;of the employee&#8217;s base salary. Total contributions made by us for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;were $5 million , $4 million &#32;and $3 million , respectively, related to the historical ICE U.K. defined contribution pension plan. 

Under NYSE's defined contribution plans, most NYSE's employees contribute a portion of their salary within legal limits. Our U.S. operations match an amount equal to 100% &#32;of the first 6% &#32;of eligible contributions. The U.K. operations contribute an equivalent of 7% &#32;of the employee's salary for all employees who are active in the savings plan. Total contributions made by us for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;and for the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013 were $9 million , $20 million &#32;and $2 million , respectively, related to the NYSE's defined contribution plans. The U.S. operations also provide benefits under a Supplemental Executive Savings Plan, or SESP, to which eligible employees may contribute. SESP employee contributions were $2 million &#32;and $2 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2014 and for the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013, respectively (there were no contributions for the year ended December 31, 2015). Included in accrued employee benefits payable was $11 million &#32;and $13 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 , and 2014 , respectively, relating to the SESP plan. 

Interactive Data's U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) Plan, or the Plan, which allows all employees to make contributions of a specified percentage of their compensation. We offer a match up to 4.5% &#32;of the employee&#8217;s eligible pay if the employee contributes at least 6% &#32;of their eligible pay, subject to statutory limits. The Plan additionally allows certain employees to contribute amounts above the specified percentage, which are not subject to any employer match. Interactive Data's U.K. employees are eligible for an Interactive Data defined contribution plan that matches employee contributions depending on hire date and age band up to a maximum amount.

Fair Value Measurements 

Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, short-term and long-term investments, customer accounts receivable, margin deposits and guaranty funds, cost and equity method investments, short-term and long-term debt and certain other short-term assets and liabilities. The fair value of our financial instruments are measured based on a three-level hierarchy: 

&#8226; 

Level 1 inputs &#8212; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

&#8226; 

Level 2 inputs &#8212; observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable. 

&#8226; 

Level 3 inputs &#8212; unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 

In general, we use Level 1 inputs to determine fair value. The Level 1 assets consist of U.S. Treasury securities, equity and other securities listed in active markets, and investments in publicly traded mutual funds held for the purpose of providing future payments of the SERP and SESP plans. Financial assets and liabilities recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the asset or liability&#8217;s fair value measurement. Financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 &#32;are as follows (in millions):

As of December 31, 2015 , the fair value of our $1.24 billion &#32;2020 Senior Notes were $1.25 billion , the fair value of our $1.24 billion &#32;2025 Senior Notes were $1.26 billion , the fair value of our $597 million &#32;2018 Senior Notes were $605 million , the fair value of our $789 million &#32;2023 Senior notes were $838 million , and the fair value of our $852 million &#32;NYSE USD Notes were $854 million . The fair values of these fixed rate notes were estimated using quoted market prices for these instruments. The fair value of our other short-term and long-term debt approximates the carrying value since the rates of interest on the debt approximate market rates as of December 31, 2015 . All other financial instruments are determined to approximate carrying value due to the short period of time to their maturities. 

The long-term investment in equity securities as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;represents our 12% &#32;investment in Cetip, recorded at its fair value using its quoted market price (Note 5). The mutual funds represent equity and fixed income mutual funds held for the purpose of providing future payments to the SERP and SESP (Note 14). As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we are holding $449 million &#32;and $374 million &#32;in U.S. Treasury securities, respectively, all of which had maturities of less than one year from the date of purchase (Note 5). 

We did not use Level 2 and 3 inputs to determine the fair value of assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . We measure certain assets, such as intangible assets and cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are recognized at fair value if they are deemed to be impaired. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , none of these assets were required to be recorded at fair value since no impairment indicators were present. 

Cost and equity method investments were $116 million &#32;and $53 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, and are classified as other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the cost and equity method investments during the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily due to our $60 million &#32;additional investment in OCC. 

We own a 40% &#32;interest in OCC through a direct investment by NYSE which we record as an equity method investment. OCC serves as a clearing house for securities options, security futures, commodity futures and options on futures traded on various independent exchanges. OCC clears securities options traded on NYSE Arca and NYSE MKT, along with other non-affiliated exchanges, and is regulated by the SEC as a registered clearing agency and by the CFTC as a derivatives clearing organization. Under equity method accounting, we will subsequently adjust the carrying value of our OCC investment on our balance sheet by recognizing our pro-rata share of the earnings or losses of OCC, with a corresponding adjustment in our statement of income to other income, after eliminating any intra-entity income or expenses. The share of OCC's earnings that we will recognize is calculated based on our 40% &#32;ownership of OCC's net income. Also, if OCC issues cash dividends to us in the future, we will deduct the amount of these dividends from the carrying amount of our investment. 

OCC adopted a new capital plan during the first quarter of 2015, which raised $150 million &#32;in equity capital from OCC's shareholders, including $60 million &#32;contributed by us. Pursuant to the terms of the capital plan, in exchange for the contributions of equity capital from its shareholders, OCC is required, subject to determination by its board of directors and compliance with legal 

requirements, to pay an annual dividend to its shareholders, on a pro rata basis, equal to the after-tax income of OCC, in excess of the amount required to maintain its target capital requirement and satisfy other capital requirements, and after refunds to its clearing members equal to 50% of distributable earnings before tax. 

Subsequent to our investment of the $60 million , aggrieved parties petitioned the SEC to review its approval, by delegated authority, of the capital plan. As a result of such petition, the SEC's approval of the capital plan was automatically stayed and OCC halted further implementation of the capital plan pending further SEC action. In September 2015, the SEC lifted the stay. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the OCC capital plan was implemented. 

Historically, OCC declared a refund to its clearing members each year that resulted in minimal profit for OCC. However, based on a new capital plan designed to comply with proposed new regulatory capital standards, OCC declared in December 2014 a reduced refund for 2014. Based on the OCC net income for the year ended December 31, 2014, we increased the carrying value of our OCC investment by $26 million , and recorded other income of $25 million &#32;during the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, we eliminated intra-entity transaction-based expenses paid to OCC of $1 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2014. We recorded the increase in our equity investment during the fourth quarter of 2014, versus throughout 2014, because we were not able to determine what the OCC refund for 2014 was going to be until the new capital plan was formalized during the fourth quarter of 2014 and the 2014 fee refund was declared. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we increased the carrying value of our investment in OCC and recorded other income of $7 million &#32;ratably throughout the year for our pro-rata share of OCC's earnings. We also reduced our carrying value of our investment in OCC by $7 million &#32;during the year ended December 31, 2015 , based on the OCC dividend that was declared in December 2015. 

In addition, under the OCC capital plan, the OCC shareholders will contribute up to $200 million &#32;in additional equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million &#32;to be contributed by us. The OCC shareholders would receive Class C stock in exchange for any additional capital contribution. No dividends or other remuneration would be paid to OCC shareholders holding Class C stock. Unless and until such $200 million &#32;capital contribution is repaid to the shareholders, OCC would be prohibited from declaring any dividends and paying refunds to its clearing members.

Discontinued Operations 

&#160; 

On June 24, 2014, we sold an aggregate 65.8 million &#32;shares of common stock of Euronext, representing 94% &#32;of Euronext's outstanding shares, in three &#32;transactions. The three &#32;transactions include our sale of 42.2 million &#32;shares of Euronext common stock in an IPO at &#8364;20 &#32;per share, 23.4 million &#32;shares of Euronext common stock to a group of European institutional investors at &#8364;19.20 &#32;per share, and 0.2 million &#32;shares of Euronext common stock to eligible Euronext employees at &#8364;16 &#32;per share. On December 9, 2014, we sold our remaining 6% , or 4.2 million &#32;shares, of Euronext common stock for &#8364;95 million &#32;( $118 million ), including a realized net gain of $4 million , which was recognized in other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2014 . The $4 million &#32;net gain included a stock price gain of $15 million &#32;based on the difference in the Euronext stock price from the IPO date to the date of sale on December 9, 2014, less $11 million &#32;in foreign currency translation losses relating to the decrease in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar during this same period of time. We no longer hold any shares of Euronext stock, and these four transactions generated an aggregate &#8364;1.5 billion &#32;( $2.1 billion ) of net cash proceeds for us. The net cash proceeds received included cash of $220 million &#32;distributed from Euronext as part of the separation of Euronext from ICE. 

On July 23, 2014, we sold Wombat, a unit of NYSE Technologies, to SR Labs. On September 19, 2014 we sold NYFIX and Metabit, the remaining businesses of NYSE Technologies, to ULLINK. These agreements complete our previously announced intention to divest non-core NYSE Technologies assets. 

Due to the sale of a controlling interest in Euronext and the sales of the three &#32;companies comprising NYSE Technologies, we de-consolidated the assets and liabilities of Euronext (as of the June 24, 2014 IPO date) and NYSE Technologies (as of the various sales dates) and included the financial results of these entities in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements effective from the NYSE acquisition date of November 13, 2013. There was no gain or loss recognized on the Euronext IPO or on the sale of the NYSE Technologies companies, as any differences in the carrying value of these net assets was adjusted in the NYSE purchase price allocation (Note 3). 

The results below include external advisory costs and professional services costs related to the sales of Euronext and NYSE Technologies of $51 million &#32;and $2 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, which have been included with acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, below, from discontinued operations. The results below also include deal-related compensation and severance costs related to the sales of Euronext and NYSE Technologies of $42 million &#32;and $19 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, which have also been included with acquisition-related transaction and integration costs below from discontinued operations. Further, the income tax provision for discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily from the impact of certain foreign tax law changes that occurred after our acquisition of NYSE on Euronext's tax assets and liabilities. 

We used the cash proceeds from the sale of Euronext to repay debt (Note 9). We used the net cash proceeds from the sale of NYSE Technologies to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Results of discontinued operations were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in millions): &#160;

Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements 

&#160; 

In connection with our acquisition of NYSE, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc., or ICE, and NYSE Holdings LLC, or NYSE Holdings, established various guarantees to protect against structural subordination of each entities&#8217; existing indebtedness. NYSE Holdings is our wholly-owned subsidiary and fully and unconditionally guarantees, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest of our Amended Credit Facility, Commercial Paper Program and our senior notes. Similarly, ICE fully and unconditionally guarantees, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest of the NYSE USD Notes. The guarantees will remain in place until each applicable debt obligation has been satisfied. 

The following consolidating financial information sets forth, under the equity method of accounting, the condensed consolidating statements of income and comprehensive income, the condensed consolidating balance sheets, and the condensed consolidating statements of cash flows for (i) ICE (Parent); (ii) NYSE Holdings; (iii) the subsidiary non-guarantors; (iv) elimination entries necessary to consolidate each of ICE (Parent) and NYSE Holdings with the non-guarantor subsidiaries; and (v) on a consolidated basis. As discussed in Note 1, we were formed on March 6, 2013 for purposes of effecting the acquisition of NYSE. Therefore, the condensed consolidating statements for periods prior thereto reflect how these statements would have been presented had we been established for all periods presented. The condensed consolidating financial statements only include activity related to NYSE for the period subsequent to November 13, 2013, the closing date of the NYSE acquisition, for the condensed consolidating statements of income, comprehensive income and cash flows. The condensed consolidating financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

&#160; 

Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Basic earnings per common share is calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average common shares outstanding increased for the year ended December 31, 2014, over the prior year period, primarily due to stock issued for the NYSE acquisition, partially offset by stock repurchases, and then decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to stock repurchases, partially offset by stock issued for the Interactive Data and Trayport acquisitions. We issued 42.4 million &#32;shares of our common stock to NYSE stockholders, 6.5 million &#32;shares of our common stock to Interactive Data stockholders and 2.5 million &#32;shares of our common stock to Trayport stockholders, weighted to show these additional shares outstanding for periods after the respective acquisition dates (Note 3). Common equivalent shares from stock options and restricted stock awards, using the treasury stock method, are also included in the diluted per share calculations unless the effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive. During the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , 167,000 &#32;and 155,000 &#32;outstanding stock options, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share, because to do so would have had an antidilutive effect. There were no &#32;outstanding stock options for the year ended December 31, 2013 with an antidilutive effect. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , there were 45,000 &#32;and 88,000 &#32;restricted stock units, respectively, that were vested but have not been issued that are included in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share. Certain figures in the table above may not recalculate due to rounding.
