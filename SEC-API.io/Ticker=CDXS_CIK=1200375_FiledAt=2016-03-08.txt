 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Company Overview 

We develop biocatalysts for the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals markets. Our proven technologies enable scale-up and implementation of biocatalytic solutions to meet customer needs for rapid, cost-effective and sustainable process development, from research to manufacturing. 

Biocatalysts are enzymes that initiate and/or accelerate chemical reactions. Manufacturers have historically used naturally occurring biocatalysts to produce many goods used in everyday life. However, inherent limitations in naturally occurring biocatalysts have restricted their commercial use. Our proprietary CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology platform, which introduces genetic mutations into genes in order to give rise to changes in the enzymes that they produce, is able to overcome many of these limitations, allowing us to evolve and optimize biocatalysts to perform specific and desired chemical reactions at commercial scale. Once potentially beneficial mutations are identified through this proprietary process, combinations of these mutations can then be tested until variant enzymes have been created that exhibit marketable performance characteristics superior to competitive products. This process allows for continuous, efficient improvements to the performance of enzymes. In the past, we implemented the CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology platform through paid collaborations with our customers. In July 2014, we entered into our first license agreement pursuant to which we granted a license to a global pharmaceutical company to use the CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology platform for their internal development purposes. In August 2015, we entered into a second license agreement involving the CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology platform with another global pharmaceutical company and we continue to pursue platform licensing opportunities with additional customers. 

We have commercialized our technology and products in the pharmaceuticals market, which is our primary business focus. Our pharmaceutical customers, which include several of the large global pharmaceutical companies, use our technology, products and services in their manufacturing processes and process development. 

We also use our technology to develop biocatalysts for use in the fine chemicals market. The fine chemicals market consists of several large market verticals, including food and food ingredients, animal feed, flavors and fragrances, and agricultural chemicals. 

We have also used our technology to develop an early stage, novel enzyme therapeutic product candidate for the potential treatment of phenylketonuria (&#8220;PKU&#8221;) in humans. PKU is an inherited metabolic disorder in which the enzyme that converts the essential amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine is deficient. 

We are actively collaborating with new and existing customers in the pharmaceutical and other markets. 

In this Annual Report, the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Codexis, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. 

Our Pharmaceutical Enzymes and Intermediates 

Our pharmaceutical products include enzymes, pharmaceutical intermediates and Codex &#174; &#32;Biocatalyst Kits and Panels. We market and sell enzymes, development services and Codex &#174; &#32;Biocatalyst Kits and Panels screening tools that enable novel manufacturing processes for active pharmaceutical ingredients (&#8220;APIs&#8221;) and their precursor pharmaceutical intermediates. We also market and sell pharmaceutical intermediates that are manufactured using our custom enzymes. Our customers include several large global pharmaceutical companies. 

We sell our products and services to both the generic and innovator pharmaceutical end markets. Our products and services have been adopted at various points of the pharmaceutical product lifecycle, from early-stage clinical testing to post-launch commercialization. 

Our Fine Chemicals Enzymes and Intermediates 

We entered the fine chemicals market in 2013, specifically through application of our biocatalysis technology in the commercial food space when we signed a joint development agreement with a market-leading food ingredients company. Our existing technology is a natural fit for the fine chemicals market and we are seeking to expand our opportunities to several market segments beyond the food market, including, for example, the animal feed, agricultural chemicals, and flavors and fragrances markets. In addition to developing biocatalyst processes for the manufacture of commercial goods using our biocatalysts, we also hope to satisfy our customers&#8217; biocatalyst manufacturing and supply needs. 

Our Novel Enzyme Therapeutic Developments 

We have developed a novel enzyme therapeutic product candidate for the potential treatment of PKU via oral administration. PKU is an inherited metabolic disorder in which the enzyme that converts the essential amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine is deficient. As a result, phenylalanine accumulates in high levels in the brain causing serious neurological problems, including intellectual disability, seizures and cognitive and behavioral problems. Phenylalanine is found in many foods, including meat, dairy products, fish, poultry and many fruits and vegetables. We continue to invest in the evaluation of our preclinical therapeutic enzyme candidate for the potential treatment of PKU. We have filed patent applications covering the composition of matter for our therapeutic enzymes and the use of these enzymes as a treatment for PKU. In addition to the PKU program, we are planning to make modest additional investments in 2016 with the aim of generating additional product candidates targeting other therapeutic areas. 

Our Strategy 

Our strategy is to grow our business by leveraging our CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology platform in the following ways: 

Licensing our CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology platform. &#32;We intend to continue to license our CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology platform to our partners for their in-house protein engineering. 

Continuing to grow our pharmaceutical biocatalysis product business. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry to integrate biocatalysts to reduce the cost for small molecule drug manufacturers. 

Continuing to grow our fine chemicals biocatalysis product business. &#32;We intend to continue to pursue opportunities in the fine chemicals market to use biocatalysts to reduce the costs for manufacturing in adjacent markets like food and food ingredients. 

Expanding our pharmaceutical R&#38;D services. &#32;We intend to continue to pursue opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry to enable the discovery or improve the manufacture &#32; of our customers&#8217; drug candidates. 

Expanding our fine chemicals R&#38;D services. &#32;We intend to pursue the development of opportunities in the fine chemical industry to enable the cost-efficient manufacture of chemical intermediates for food, agricultural chemicals, flavors and fragrances and other industries. 

Creating and advancing novel therapeutics. &#32;We intend to advance our own novel enzyme therapeutic candidate for the potential treatment of PKU. We also intend to invest in R&#38;D in an effort to generate early stage novel therapeutic candidates 

Our therapeutic candidate for the potential treatment of PKU and any other therapeutic candidates that we generate will be developed either with a partner or by ourselves. 

License Our CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;Protein Engineering Technology Platform 

Our CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology platform enables rapid development of custom-designed enzymes that are highly optimized for efficient manufacturing processes. We intend to continue to enter into license arrangements with third parties that will allow the third parties to use our CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology platform to discover and develop novel proteins for their internal use. 

GlaxoSmithKline 

We entered into our first CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology Platform Technology Transfer, Collaboration and License Agreement (&#8220;GSK CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;Agreement&#8221;) on July 10, 2014 with GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property Development Limited, a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline plc (collectively, &#8220;GSK&#8221;). 

The GSK CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;Agreement allows GSK to use our proprietary CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology platform in the field of human healthcare. The CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology platform enables rapid development of custom-designed enzymes that are highly optimized to enable more efficient manufacturing processes. The CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology platform, which is comprised of proprietary methods for the design and generation of diverse genetic libraries, automated screening techniques, algorithms for the interpretation of screening data and predictive modeling, is covered by more than 170 issued patents and patent applications worldwide.

Merck has the right to grant sublicenses to affiliates of Merck and, in certain limited circumstances, to third parties. We also granted to Merck a license to make or have made products manufactured using the CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology platform with a right to grant sublicenses solely to affiliates of Merck, contract manufacturing organizations and contract research organizations. The manufacturing license is exclusive in the Merck Exclusive Field and non-exclusive in the Merck Non-Exclusive Field. The licenses are subject to certain limitations based on pre-existing contractual obligations that apply to the technology and intellectual property that are the subject of the license grants. The licenses do not permit the use of the CodeEvolver &#174; protein engineering technology platform to discover any therapeutic enzyme, diagnostic product or vaccine. In addition, Merck is prohibited from using the CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology platform to develop or produce enzymes or any other compounds for or on behalf of any third parties except in a very limited manner when Merck divests a therapeutic product that is manufactured using an enzyme developed using the CodeEvolver &#174; protein engineering technology platform. 

Under the terms of the Merck CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;Agreement, Merck will pay us up to $18.0 million in technology transfer milestone payments over the period of approximately 15 to 24 months from August 3, 2015, the effective date of the Merck CodeEvolver &#174; Agreement . We also have the potential to receive product-related payments of up to $15.0 million for each API that is manufactured by Merck using one or more enzymes that have been developed or are in development using the CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology platform during the 10-year period that begins on the conclusion of the 15 to 24 month technology transfer period. These product-related payments, if any, will be paid by Merck to us for each quarter that Merck manufactures API using a CodeEvolver &#174; -developed enzyme. The payments will be based on the total volume of API produced using the CodeEvolver &#174; -developed enzyme. We have the right to conduct an annual audit to confirm that all payments that are owed to us have been paid in full and on time. 

Under the Merck CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;Agreement, we are transferring our CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering platform technology to Merck during the technology transfer period. As a part of this technology transfer, we provide to Merck our proprietary enzymes, proprietary protein engineering protocols and methods, and proprietary software algorithms.

Our Pharmaceutical Products and Services 

Our Opportunity in the Pharmaceutical Market 

The pharmaceutical industry represents a significant market opportunity for us and is our primary business focus. Pharmaceutical companies are now under significant competitive pressure both to reduce costs and to increase the speed to market for their products. To meet these pressures, pharmaceutical companies seek manufacturing processes for their new and existing drugs that reduce overall costs, simplify production and increase efficiency and product yield, while not affecting drug safety and efficacy. In addition, for pharmaceutical products whose patents have expired, the importance of cost reduction is even higher, as the manufacturers that developed those patent-protected drugs, known as innovators, compete with manufacturers of generic drugs. 

The pharmaceutical product lifecycle begins with the discovery of new chemical entities and continues through preclinical and clinical development, product launch, commercial scale-up and, ultimately, patent expiration and the transition from branded to generic products. As innovators develop, produce and then market products, manufacturing priorities and processes evolve. Historically, innovators have focused on production cost reduction in the later stages of clinical development and have been reluctant to make process changes after a product has been launched. However, as pressures to reduce costs have increased, innovators have pursued cost reduction measures much earlier in the pharmaceutical product lifecycle and are increasingly looking for opportunities to improve their operating margins, including making manufacturing process changes for marketed products after the products have been launched if these changes can result in significant cost reductions. As a result, innovators are investing in new technologies to improve their manufacturing productivity and efficiency or outsourcing the manufacture of their intermediates and APIs. 

Our Solution for the Pharmaceutical Market 

Our CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology platform enables us to deliver solutions to our customers in the pharmaceutical market by developing and delivering optimized enzymes that perform chemical transformations at a lower cost and improve the efficiency and productivity of manufacturing processes. We provide value throughout the pharmaceutical product lifecycle. Our pharmaceutical products and services allow us to provide benefits to our customers in a number of ways, including: 

&#8226; reducing the use of raw materials and intermediate products; 

&#8226; reducing the number of processing steps; 

&#8226; improving product yield; 

&#8226; using water as a primary solvent; 

&#8226; performing reactions at or near room temperature and pressure; 

&#8226; eliminating the need for certain costly manufacturing equipment; 

&#8226; reducing energy requirements; 

&#8226; reducing the need for late-stage purification steps; 

&#8226; reducing the generation of chemical byproducts or waste; 

&#8226; eliminating multiple steps in the manufacturing process; and 

&#8226; eliminating hazardous inputs. 

Early in the product lifecycle, customers can use our products and services to achieve speed to market and to reduce manufacturing costs. If an innovator incorporates our products or processes into a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) approved product, we expect the innovator to continue to use these products or processes over the patent life of the approved drug. 

After a product is launched, customers can also use our products and services to reduce manufacturing costs. At this stage, changes in the manufacturing process originally approved by the FDA may require additional regulatory review. Typically, pharmaceutical companies will only seek FDA approval for a manufacturing change if there are substantial cost savings associated with the change. We believe that the cost savings associated with our products may lead our customers to change their manufacturing processes for approved products and, if necessary, seek FDA approval of the new processes which incorporate our enzymes. Moreover, we believe these cost savings are attractive to generics manufacturers, who compete primarily on price. 

Pharmaceutical Products and Services 

Codex &#174; Biocatalyst Panels and Kits. We sell Codex &#174; &#32;Biocatalyst Panels and Kits to customers who are engaged in both drug development and drug manufacturing &#32; to allow them to screen and identify possible enzymes that can be applied in the manufacturing processes for their drug candidates and their marketed products. Codex &#174; &#32;Biocatalyst Panels are tools that provide genetically diverse variants of our proprietary enzymes, which allow our customers to determine whether an enzyme produces a desired activity that is applicable to a particular process. Codex &#174; &#32;Biocatalyst Kits provide subsets of the Codex &#174; &#32;Biocatalyst Panel enzymes in individual vials for the same purpose. 

For compounds that are in development, Codex &#174; &#32;Biocatalyst Panels and Kits: 

&#8226; 

allow innovators to screen and identify possible enzymatic manufacturing processes rapidly and inexpensively for many of their drug candidates in-house, without the risks of disclosing the composition of their proprietary molecules before they have received patent protection; and 

&#8226; 

generate data that we can use to optimize enzymes rapidly for a particular reaction, if necessary, reducing the time required to generate a manufacturing process capable of supporting clinical trials with inexpensively produced, pure drugs. 

We believe that our Codex &#174; &#32;Biocatalyst Panels and Kits have helped us build early and broad awareness of the power and utility of our technology platform, and will increasingly lead to sales of our enzymes and enzyme optimization services, as well as intermediates and APIs made using our enzymes. Many of our pharmaceutical customers, which include several large global pharmaceutical companies, have used our Codex &#174; &#32;Biocatalyst Panels and Kits. If our customers incorporate an enzymatic manufacturing process early in a product&#8217;s lifecycle, they can reduce their manufacturing costs throughout that lifecycle, while we, in turn, could realize a long term revenue stream resulting from the use of our enzymes during that time. In addition, Codex &#174; &#32;Biocatalyst Panels and Kits are increasingly used by our customers to evaluate the feasibility of changing the manufacturing process for their marketed products to an enzyme-enabled process. 

Enzyme screening services. If a customer prefers, rather than subscribing to our Codex &#174; &#32;Biocatalyst Panels or Kits to use for their own screening, they can send us their materials to test against our existing libraries of enzymes. If we detect desired activity in a specific enzyme, we can supply the customer with this enzyme or perform optimization services to improve the performance of the enzyme. 

Enzyme optimization services. We work with our customers throughout the pharmaceutical product lifecycle to customize enzymes, resulting in optimized enzymes that have been evolved specifically to perform a desired process according to a highly selective set of specifications. 

Our enzyme optimization services: 

&#8226; 

allow innovators to improve the manufacturing process as their drug candidates progress through preclinical and clinical development, in some cases deferring or reducing the need for significant manufacturing investment until the likelihood of commercial success is more certain; and 

&#8226; 

enable manufacturing processes that are highly efficient, inexpensive, require relatively little energy, reduce the need for hazardous reagents and reduce waste. For example, our activities with Merck have included developing an optimized enzymatic manufacturing process for a key intermediate that reduces a fourteen step manufacturing process to five steps. 

Enzymes. We supply varying quantities of our enzymes to pharmaceutical companies, from small to moderate quantities while they are optimizing their production processes, to larger quantities during later-stage clinical development and commercial scale drug production. 

Our enzymes: 

&#8226; 

enable innovators to manufacture products more efficiently during preclinical and clinical development using optimized enzymatic processes, with relatively low investment; 

&#8226; 

eliminate the need for innovators to invest in the development of complex chemical synthesis routes during the development stage; 

&#8226; 

allow innovators to achieve higher product purity during the development stage prior to investing in expensive late-stage clinical trials; 

&#8226; 

reduce the risk of adverse effects arising from product impurities; 

&#8226; 

allow the removal of entire steps from synthetic chemical production routes during commercial scale production, reducing raw material costs, energy requirements and the need for capital expenditures; and 

&#8226; 

decrease the manufacturing costs for our customers. 

For instance, as a part of our ongoing collaboration with Merck, we have developed an enzyme for use in a manufacturing process for sitagliptin, the API in Merck&#8217;s pharmaceutical product Januvia &#174; . Januvia &#174; &#32;is Merck&#8217;s medication for the treatment of Type II diabetes. 

Intermediates and APIs. We can supply our customers with intermediates and APIs made using our enzymes throughout the drug lifecycle. 

Our supply of intermediates has the following uses and benefits: 

&#8226; 

lowers capital investment for innovators through outsourcing of manufacturing; and 

&#8226; 

provides a source of less expensive, more pure products to innovator and generics manufacturers. 

We have developed enzymes for use in the manufacture of certain generic intermediates and APIs by various companies. In addition, we market several intermediates and APIs for the generic equivalents of branded pharmaceutical products for sale in markets where innovators have not sought patent protection for their products and intend to sell these same intermediates and APIs for use in markets where innovators have sought patent protection when the patent protection for each product expires. 

Pharmaceutical Business Model 

We typically enter into research collaborations with our pharmaceutical customers. These agreements often contain service and intellectual property provisions under which we develop optimized enzymes for innovator pharmaceutical companies in connection with their drug development efforts. In these collaborations, we typically receive consideration in the form of one or more of the following: up-front payments, milestone payments, payments for screening and optimization services and licensing fees and royalties. 

Our pharmaceutical products include enzymes, pharmaceutical intermediates APIs, and Codex &#174; &#32;Biocatalyst Panels and Kits. We sell our products primarily to pharmaceutical manufacturers through our directed sales and business development force in the United States and Europe. 

Our Fine Chemicals Industry Products and Services 

We entered the fine chemicals market in 2013, specifically through application of our biocatalysis technology in the commercial food space when we signed a joint development agreement with a market-leading food ingredients company. Our existing technology is a natural fit for the fine chemicals market and we believe that we are able to significantly leverage the technological innovations that we have developed in our pharmaceutical business to the fine chemicals market in order to provide fine chemicals customers with enzyme development and services similar to what we currently provide to our pharmaceutical customers. 

We are seeking to expand our fine chemicals market opportunities beyond the food market, including for example, the animal feed, agricultural chemicals and flavors and fragrances markets. In addition to developing biocatalyst processes for the manufacture of commercial fine goods using our biocatalysts for the fine chemicals markets, we also hope to satisfy our fine chemicals customers&#8217; biocatalyst manufacturing and supply needs. 

Discovery and Development of Biologic Drug Candidates 

We are targeting new opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry to discover or improve biologic drug candidates for our customers. We believe that our CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering platform technology can be used to discover novel biologic drug candidates that will target indications that our customers select. Similarly, we believe that we can deploy our platform technology to improve specific characteristics of a customer&#8217;s pre-existing biologic drug candidate. For example, we may be able to use our technology to improve the activity, stability or immunogenicity of a customer&#8217;s biologic drug candidate. 

Novel Enzyme Therapeutic Program 

We have developed a novel enzyme therapeutic product candidate for the potential treatment of PKU via oral administration. PKU is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes for the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (&#8220;PAH&#8221;), making the enzyme deficient or nonfunctional. PAH is necessary to convert the essential amino acid phenylalanine into the amino acid tyrosine. Phenylalanine is found in many foods, including meat, dairy products, fish, poultry and many fruits and vegetables. Without functional PAH, high levels of phenylalanine accumulate in the body and cause serious neurological complications, including intellectual disability, seizures, mental illness, tremors and cognitive and behavioral problems. To avoid high levels of phenylalanine in their blood, individuals with PKU must follow a strict, life-long diet that is low in phenylalanine and supplement their diet with a synthetic phenylalanine-free formula to provide them with sufficient nutrients. Maintaining a strict, life-long diet can be challenging for individuals with PKU. There are an estimated 50,000 people with PKU in the developed world. PKU is considered a rare disease in the United States and the European Union. The United States and most other developed countries test for PKU as part of newborn screening programs. 

We continue to invest in the evaluation of our preclinical therapeutic enzyme candidate for the potential treatment of PKU. We have filed patent applications covering the composition of matter for our therapeutic enzymes and the use of these enzymes as a treatment for PKU. In addition to the PKU program, we are planning to make modest additional investments in 2016 with the aim of generating additional product candidates targeting other therapeutic areas.&#8221; 

CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;Protein Engineering Technology Platform 

We engineer custom enzymes, which we sometimes refer to as biocatalysts. In simple terms, our biocatalysts accelerate chemical reactions. We use our CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology platform, which includes computational biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and various other technologies to develop novel enzymes that enable industrial biocatalytic reactions and fermentations. Our technology platform has enabled commercially viable products and processes for the manufacture of pharmaceutical intermediates and active ingredients. 

Our approach to developing commercially viable biocatalytic manufacturing processes begins by conceptually designing the most cost-effective and practical process for a targeted product. We then develop optimized biocatalysts to enable that process design, using our directed technology, including screening and validating biocatalysts under relevant conditions. Typical design criteria include stability in the desired reaction conditions, biocatalyst activity and productivity (yield), ease of product isolation, product purity and cost. Alternative approaches to biocatalytic process development typically involve designing and engineering the biocatalytic processes around shortcomings of available biocatalysts, including, for example, the use of dilute reaction systems, suboptimal solvents, special equipment and costly product isolation and purification methods. We circumvent 

the need for these types of costly process design modifications by optimizing the biocatalyst for fitness in the desired process environment. As a result, we enable and develop cost-efficient processes that typically are relatively simple to run in conventional manufacturing equipment. This also allows for the efficient technical transfer of our process to our manufacturing partners. 

The successful embodiment of our CodeEvolver &#174; &#32;protein engineering technology platform in commercial manufacturing processes requires well-integrated expertise in a number of technical disciplines. In addition to those directly involved in practicing our directed evolution technologies, such as molecular biology, enzymology, microbiology, cellular engineering, metabolic engineering, bioinformatics, biochemistry and high throughput analytical chemistry, our process development projects also involve integrated expertise in organic chemistry, chemical process development, chemical engineering, fermentation process development and fermentation engineering. Our integrated, multi-disciplinary approach to biocatalyst and process development is a critical success factor for our company. 

Enzyme Optimization Overview 

The enzyme optimization process starts by identifying genes that code for enzymes known to have the general type of catalytic reactivity for a desired chemical reaction. Typically, we identify gene sequences from our extensive in-house collection or from published databases and then synthesize candidate genes having those sequences. Using a variety of biotechnology tools, we diversify these genes by introducing mutations, giving rise to changes in the enzymes for which they encode. The methods for diversifying these genes, and types of diversity being tested, often vary over the course of an enzyme optimization program. For finding initial diversity, methods typically include random mutagenesis and site-directed (included structure-guided) mutagenesis. We also test mutational variations that distinguish related enzymes among different organisms. Once we have identified potentially beneficial mutations, we test combinations of these mutations in libraries made using our proprietary gene recombination methodologies, gene shuffling and automated parallel multiplexed gene SOEing (APS), where SOE is a PCR based technique, Splicing by Overlap Extension. 

With our proprietary gene shuffling methodology, we generate libraries of genes that have programmed and random combinations of the mutations we are testing. The pool of genes is used to transform host cells, which entails introducing the various genes into host cells. These cells are then grown into colonies. Cells from individual colonies are cultured in high throughput to produce the enzyme encoded by the shuffled gene in those cells. The enzymes expressed by these cells are then screened in high throughput using test conditions relevant to the desired process. The screening results identify individual shuffled genes that produce improved enzymes having combinations of beneficial mutations and weed out enzymes having detrimental ones. Using different test conditions and/or different analytical methods, we can identify variant enzymes that exhibit various improved performance characteristics, such as stability, activity and selectivity, under conditions relevant to the desired chemical process. 

In the next step in our optimization process, we use our proprietary software tools, ProSAR&#8482; and MOSAIC &#174; , to analyze protein sequence-activity relationships. ProSAR&#8482; aids in identifying specific gene and enzyme mutations that are beneficial, neutral or detrimental with respect to the desired performance characteristics. MOSAIC &#174; &#32;aids in identifying functional interactions of mutations within a specific gene or enzyme that are beneficial, neutral or detrimental with respect to the desired performance characteristics. Earlier directed evolution methods did not separately evaluate individual mutations or their interactions in libraries of variants which carry multiple mutations, where beneficial and detrimental performance characteristics may be mixed in an individual gene or enzyme. Capitalizing on the advent of inexpensive gene sequencing, we are able to determine which particular mutations are present in the genes and proteins we have screened. Our ProSAR&#8482; and MOSAIC &#174; &#32;bioinformatics software relates the screening results to the mutations and ranks the individual mutations (ProSAR&#8482;) and interacting mutations (MOSAIC &#174; ) with regard to their degree of benefit or detriment, relative to the process parameter(s) tested. Using this information, we can bias the pool of mutational diversity in the next iteration to further the accumulation of beneficial diversity and cancel out detrimental diversity in the individual genes in the resulting shuffled library. The results from both ProSAR&#8482; and MOSAIC &#174; &#32;also help us develop ideas about new diversity to test. ProSAR&#8482; and MOSAIC &#174; , combined with efficient gene synthesis and high quality library generation methods, have led to a significant increase in the efficiency and speed of enzyme improvement and optimization. 

In another step of our optimization process, we take the best variants we have identified and prepare small amounts of each to test in the desired chemical process at laboratory scale, for in-process confirmation. This optimization routine is done iteratively, typically adding new diversity to the pool in each iteration. The gene that codes for the best performing enzyme in one iteration is used as the starting gene for the next iteration of shuffling and screening. As the enzymes improve over these iterations, the screening conditions are made increasingly more stringent. In this way, enzymes are rapidly optimized until all in-process performance requirements have been achieved and the economic objectives for the desired process have been met. 

Multiplexed gene SOEing is our proprietary methodology for rapidly generating gene variants. Using multiplexed gene SOEing, we rapidly generate collections of individual gene variants that have predetermined, as opposed to random, combinations of mutations we are testing. It is based on a biotechnology technique, which we refer to as SOEing, generally used to make a hybrid, or spliced, gene from fragments of two genes and/or to introduce a specific mutation into a splice between fragments of one gene. We have automated the process to make robotically, in parallel, one hundred to several hundred variants, each with a predetermined combination of the mutations we are testing. The variants are introduced into host cells, and the encoded enzyme is produced and screened in high throughput, as described above. 

Using multiplexed gene SOEing, we can test many mutations and combinations thereof in parallel, and because the mutation incorporation is controlled and predetermined before screening, as opposed to random incorporation and selection after screening, the resulting data set can be more optimal for ProSAR&#8482; analysis. 

We believe using multiplexed gene SOEing to survey many mutations quickly, followed by ProSAR&#8482; and MOSAIC &#174; -driven shuffling of beneficial mutations, is a particularly effective approach, providing rapid gains in enzyme performance. 

Codex &#174; &#32;Biocatalyst Panels and Kits 

Codex &#174; &#32;Biocatalyst Panels were initially developed to speed our own internal process for identifying enzymes with desired characteristics for further optimization. Each Codex &#174; &#32;Biocatalyst Panel is comprised of variants of one or more enzymes that catalyze one type of a generally useful chemical reaction. We assemble, on one or more multi-well sample plates, variants of a parent enzyme that we pre-optimize for stability in industrial chemical processes and for ready manufacturability. The variants are diversified to react to a variety of chemical structures that are susceptible to that type of chemical reaction. 

Either we or our innovator pharmaceutical customers use the Codex &#174; &#32;Biocatalyst Panels to screen a new chemical structure against the assembled variants to identify variants that react with the new chemical structure rapidly. For some new structures, a variant on the panel could enable production of the desired product. We can also analyze the data from the panel screen using ProSAR&#8482; to identify the mutations that are beneficial for the reaction of the new structure and further optimize the enzyme as needed using the enzyme optimization techniques described above. In cases where a customer wishes to screen a proprietary new chemical structure itself, we can produce a custom panel of new variants on a sample plate produced by multiplexed gene SOEing. 

In 2010, we launched Codex &#174; &#32;Screening Kits as an alternative format to provide our enzymes to pharmaceutical development laboratories that are not equipped to use multi-well sample plates. The enzymes are instead individually provided in vials for the researchers to sample. 

Intellectual Property 

Our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary products and technology under patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws. We also rely heavily on confidential disclosure agreements for further protection of our proprietary products and technologies. Protection of our technologies is important for us to offer our customers and partners proprietary services and products that are not available from our competitors, and to exclude our competitors from practicing technology that we have developed or exclusively licensed from other parties. For example, our ability to supply innovator pharmaceutical manufacturers depends on our ability to supply proprietary enzymes or methods for making pharmaceutical intermediates or APIs that are not available from our competitors. Likewise, in the generic pharmaceutical area, proprietary protection, through patent, trade secret or other protection of our enzymes and methods of producing a pharmaceutical product is important for us and our customers to maintain a lower cost production advantage over competitors. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned or controlled approximately 500 &#32;issued patents and approximately 290 &#32;pending patent applications in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. These patents and patent applications include many that are directed to our enabling technologies and specific methods and products that support our business in the pharmaceutical markets. Our intellectual property rights have terms that expire between 2016 &#32;and 2035 . Our United States intellectual property rights directed to enabling technologies developed by Codexis have terms that expire from 2019 to 2034. We continue to file new patent applications, for which terms generally extend 20 years from the non-provisional filing date in the United States. 

In October 2010, we acquired substantially all of the patents and other intellectual property rights associated with directed evolution technology, known as the MolecularBreeding&#8482; technology platform, of Maxygen, Inc. (&#8220;Maxygen&#8221;), including patents, trademarks, copyrights, software and certain assumed contracts. The intellectual property rights and assets that we acquired from Maxygen continue to be subject to existing license rights previously granted by Maxygen to third parties, including Novozymes A/S (&#8220;Novozymes&#8221;). Codexis and Novozymes enjoy co-exclusive rights in certain fields. Novozymes also has exclusive rights to some of the intellectual property that we acquired from Maxygen in certain limited fields, including development, production and sales of industrial proteins for use in processes for textile, garment, leather, wood and paper 

production, certain starch, food and animal feed production, certain personal care products, oil drilling, dyestuffs and dyeing, and electronics industry waste water treatment. The enabling technology developed by Codexis is not subject to any of the limitations or pre-existing rights of the Maxygen license to any third parties. 

&#32;We will continue to file and prosecute patent applications and maintain trade secrets in an ongoing effort to protect our intellectual property. It is possible that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may be successfully challenged or invalidated in whole or in part. It is also possible that we may not obtain issued patents from our pending patent applications or other inventions we seek to protect. We sometimes permit certain intellectual property to lapse or go abandoned under appropriate circumstances. Due to uncertainties inherent in prosecuting patent applications, sometimes patent applications are rejected and we subsequently abandon them. It is also possible that we may develop proprietary products or technologies in the future that are not patentable or that the patents of others will limit or altogether preclude our ability to conduct business. In addition, any patent issued to us may provide us with little or no competitive advantage, in which case we may abandon such patent or license it to another entity. 

Our registered and pending United States and foreign trademarks include Codexis &#174; , Codex &#174; , CodeEvolver &#174; , CodeXporter &#174; , CodeXol &#174; , CodeXyme &#174; , Powered by CodeEvolver &#174; , We Are Biocatalysis &#174; , Mosaic &#174; , Sage&#8482;, Microcyp &#174; , MYCP&#8482;, Hit from a Kit&#8482;, ProSAR&#8482;, We&#8217;re Codexis. Proven Products. Real Results &#174; , Driving the New Sugar Economy &#174; , and a Codexis and design mark (i.e., the Codexis logo). We are no longer using the marks related to our biofuels or biochemical businesses (i.e., CodeXyme &#174; , CodeXol &#174; , and Driving the New Sugar Economy &#174; ), but still own the rights and registrations. 

Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop technology or products that are similar to ours or that compete with ours. Patent, trademark, and trade secret laws afford only limited protection for our technology platform and products. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties have in the past attempted, and may in the future attempt, to operate under aspects of our intellectual property or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights, which may render our protected technology and products less valuable, if the design around is favorably received in the marketplace. In addition, if any of our products or technology is covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, we could be subject to various legal actions. We cannot assure you that our technology platform and products do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future. 

Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement, invalidity, misappropriation, or other claims. For example, in February 2016, we filed a complaint against EnzymeWorks, Inc., a California corporation, EnzymeWorks, Inc., a Chinese corporation, and Junhua &#8220;Alex&#8221; Tao (collectively, the &#8220;Defendants&#8221;), alleging that the Defendants have engaged in, among other things, willful patent infringement, trade secret misappropriation and breach of confidence. The outcome of the case and the timing of its resolution are uncertain. For further information regarding this litigation, see Item 3, &#8220;Legal Proceedings.&#8221; Our litigation against the Defendants and any other such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. Moreover, any settlement of or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to make, use or sell the products or technology that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology. 

Former Biofuels and Bioindustrial Programs 

In November 2013, we announced that we were winding down our CodeXyme &#174; &#32;cellulase enzymes program, and that we had stopped development of our CodeXol &#174; &#32;detergent alcohols program. These decisions relating to our biofuels and bioindustrial programs have allowed us to re-direct our resources to other opportunities for our technology in other fields, including the fine chemicals field. 

Competition 

Overview 

We face differing forms of competition in the pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals markets, as set forth below. 

Pharmaceuticals 

Our primary competitors in the biocatalysis market for pharmaceutical products are companies using conventional, non-enzymatic processes to manufacture pharmaceutical intermediates and APIs that compete in the marketplace with our enzymatically manufactured products. The principal methods of competition and competitive differentiation in this market are price, product quality and performance, including manufacturing yield and safety and environmental benefits and speed of 

delivery of product. The market for the manufacture and supply of APIs and intermediates is large with many established companies. These companies include many of our large innovator and generic pharmaceutical customers, such as Merck, GSK, Pfizer, Bristol Myers Squibb and Teva, who have significant internal research and development efforts directed at developing processes to manufacture APIs and intermediates. The processes used by these companies include classical conventional organic chemistry reactions, chemo catalysis reactions catalyzed by chemical catalysts, or biocatalytic routes using commercially available enzymes, or combinations thereof. Our manufacturing processes must compete with these internally developed routes. Additionally, we also face competition from companies such as Solvias AG and Takasago International Corporation who use metal-based chemical reactions for pharmaceutical products, rather than a biocatalytic process. Finally, we face increasing competition from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers in low cost centers such as India and China. 

The market for supplying enzymes for use in pharmaceutical manufacturing is quite fragmented. There is competition from large industrial enzyme companies, such as Novozymes, as well as subsidiaries of larger contract research/contract manufacturing organizations (&#8220;CRO/CMO&#8221;), such as Royal DSM N.V. (&#8220;DSM&#8221;), Cambrex Corporation and Almac Group Ltd. There is also competition in the customized and optimized enzyme area from several small European companies, such as BRAIN AG, c-LEcta GmbH and evocatal GmbH. 

We believe that our principal advantage is our ability to rapidly deliver customized enzyme products for existing and new intermediates and APIs in the pharmaceuticals market. This capability has allowed us to create a breadth of products with improved performance characteristics including, for example, activity, stability, and activity on a range of substrates, compared to traditional chemistry-based manufacturing processes and naturally occurring biocatalysts. We believe that our directed evolution technology provides substantially superior results, in shorter time frames, than companies offering competing biocatalyst development services. 

Fine Chemicals 

We entered the fine chemicals market in 2013 by applying our biocatalysis technology in the food market. We face similar forms of competition in this market as in the pharmaceutical markets, with the exception that the risk of losing out on opportunities to larger competitors in fine chemicals is greater given the larger scale of opportunities available in the fine chemicals market compared to the pharmaceutical market. Our significant competitors in the fine chemicals markets include companies that have been in these marketplaces for many years, such as Dupont-Genencor, DSM, Novozymes and A.B. Enterprises. These companies have greater resources in these markets than we do and have long-term supply arrangements already in place with customers. Our ability to compete in these markets may be limited by our relatively late entrance into these markets. 

Core Technology 

We are a leader in the field of directed molecular evolution of biocatalysts. Both our pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals businesses rely on our core technology. We are aware that other companies, organizations and persons have developed technologies that appear to have some similarities to our patented proprietary technologies. For example, we are aware that other companies, including DSM and BASF, have alternative methods for obtaining and generating genetic diversity or use mutagenesis techniques to produce genetic diversity. In addition, academic institutions such as the California Institute of Technology, the Max Planck Institute and the Center for Fundamental and Applied Molecular Evolution (&#8220;FAME&#8221;), a jointly sponsored initiative between Emory University and Georgia Institute of Technology, are also working in this field. This field is highly competitive and companies and academic and research institutions are actively seeking to develop technologies that could be competitive with our technologies. 

Technological developments by others may result in our products and technologies, as well as products developed by our customers using our biocatalysts, becoming obsolete. We monitor publications and patents that relate to directed molecular evolution to be aware of developments in the field and evaluate appropriate courses of action in relation to these developments. 

Many of our competitors have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development, personnel and marketing resources than we do. In addition, certain of our competitors may also benefit from local government subsidies and other incentives that are not available to us. As a result, our competitors may be able to develop competing and/or superior technologies and processes, and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could. Our technologies and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors. As more companies develop new intellectual property in our markets, the possibility of a competitor acquiring patent or other rights that may limit our products or potential products increases, which could lead to litigation. 

Enzyme Therapeutics 

There are numerous companies that participate in the enzyme therapeutics market or PKU market. Many of these companies are large, successful and well-capitalized. BioMarin and Daiichi Sankyo market Kuvan&#174; in the United States, Europe and Japan for the treatment of a certain type of PKU. BioMarin is also conducting a phase III clinical trial for an injectable enzyme substitution therapy for the potential treatment of PKU. Shire, Genzyme / Sanofi and other companies market or are actively developing new enzyme therapeutics. There are numerous companies that are developing other forms of therapeutics, such as small molecules and gene therapy, that could compete with enzyme therapeutics. 

Operations 

Our corporate headquarters is located in Redwood City, California and provides general administrative support to our business and is the center of our research, development and business operations. We have limited internal manufacturing capacity at our headquarters in Redwood City. We expect to rely on third-party manufacturers for commercial production of our biocatalysts for the foreseeable future. Our in-house manufacturing is dedicated to producing both Codex &#174; &#32;Biocatalyst Panels and Kits and enzymes for use by our customers in pilot scale production. We also supply initial commercial quantities of biocatalysts for use by our collaborators to produce pharmaceutical intermediates and manufacture biocatalysts that we sell. Please see Note 15 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our revenue and long-lived assets both within and outside of the United States. 

Our research and development operations include efforts directed towards biocatalyst evolution, bioprocess development, cellular engineering, biocatalyst screening, metabolites, strain improvement, fermentation development and process engineering. We conduct enzyme evolution, enzyme production development, microbial bioprocess development, cellular engineering, microbial evolution and process engineering evaluations and design primarily at our headquarters in Redwood City, California. For more information on our research and development expenditures, see Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Manufacturing of our enzymes is conducted primarily in two locations, at our in-house facility in Redwood City, California and at a third-party contract manufacturing organization, Lactosan, GmbH &#38; Co. KG (&#8220;Lactosan&#8221;), in Kapfenberg, Austria. In late 2015, we commenced limited manufacturing of certain enzymes at another third-party contract manufacturing organization in Western Europe. Generally, we perform smaller scale manufacturing in-house and outsource the larger scale manufacturing to Lactosan and the other contract manufacturer. 

We intend to rely on contract manufacturers for the production of the biocatalysts used in our fine chemicals business.
