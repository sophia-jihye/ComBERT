 Item 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Chemours, a leading global provider of performance chemicals, began operating as an independent public company on July 1, 2015 (the Distribution Date) after separating from E. I. du Pont de Nemours (DuPont). We have three reporting segments: Titanium Technologies, Fluoroproducts and Chemical Solutions. Our products are key inputs into end-products and processes in a variety of industries. Our Titanium Technologies segment is the leading global producer of titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ), a premium white pigment used to deliver whiteness, brightness, opacity and protection in a variety of applications. Our Fluoroproducts segment is a leading global provider of fluoroproducts, such as refrigerants and industrial fluoropolymer resins. Our Chemical Solutions segment is the leading North American provider of industrial and specialty chemicals used in gold production, oil refining, agriculture, industrial polymers and other industries. 

Effective prior to the opening of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on July 1, 2015, DuPont completed the separation of the businesses comprising DuPont&#8217;s Performance Chemicals reporting segment, and certain other assets and liabilities, into Chemours, a separate and distinct public company. The separation was completed by way of a distribution of all of the then-outstanding shares of common stock of Chemours through a dividend in kind of Chemours&#8217; common stock (par value $0.01 ) to holders of DuPont common stock (par value $0.30 ) as of the close of business on June 23, 2015 (the Record Date) (the transaction is referred to herein as the Distribution). 

On the Distribution Date, each holder of DuPont's common stock received one share of Chemours' common stock for every five shares of DuPont's common stock held on the Record Date. The spin-off was completed pursuant to a separation agreement and other agreements with DuPont related to the spin-off, including an employee matters agreement, a tax matters agreement, a transition services agreement and an intellectual property cross-license agreement. These agreements govern the relationship between Chemours and DuPont following the spin-off and provided for the allocation of various assets, liabilities, rights and obligations. These agreements also include arrangements for transition services to be provided by DuPont to Chemours. 

We operate 35 production facilities located in 11 countries and serve more than 5,000 customers across a wide range of end markets in more than 130 countries. The following chart illustrates the global scope of our businesses: 

Chemours is committed to creating value for our customers through the reliable delivery of high quality products and services around the globe. We create value for customers and stockholders through (i) operational excellence and asset efficiency, which includes our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, (ii) strong customer focus to produce innovative, high-performance products, (iii) focus on cash flow generation through optimization of our cost structure, and improvement in working capital and supply chain efficiencies through our transformation plan (described in Chemours Strategy section below), (iv) organic growth and (v) creation of an organization that is committed to our corporate values of safety, customer appreciation, simplicity, collective entrepreneurship and integrity. 

Many of Chemours' commercial and industrial relationships have been in place for decades. Our customers are comprised of a diverse group of companies, many of which are leaders in their respective industries. Our sales are not materially dependent on any single customer. As of December 31, 2015, no one individual customer balance represented more than five percent of Chemours&#8217; total outstanding receivables balance and no single customer represented more than ten percent of our sales. 

Chemours Five-Point Transformation Plan 

Immediately after Chemours was launched as an independent public company, we began to make changes to our organization, cost structure and portfolio of businesses to transform our company into a higher growth chemistry company. The objectives of our multi-year five-point transformation plan are to improve our financial performance, streamline and strengthen our portfolio and reduce our leverage by: 

1. 

Reducing our costs through a simpler business model; 

2. 

Optimizing our portfolio to focus on our businesses where we have leading positions; 

3. 

Growing our market positions where we have competitive advantages; 

4. 

Refocusing our investments by concentrating our capital expenditures on our core businesses; and 

5. 

Enhancing our organization to deliver our values and support our transformation to a higher-value chemistry company. 

Through cost reduction and growth, Chemours expects the transformation plan to deliver $500 million of incremental Adjusted EBITDA improvement over 2015 through 2017. Based on our anticipated cost reduction and growth initiatives, we would expect an approximately similar improvement in pre-tax income. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the closest GAAP financial measures, see our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Item 7. Through a combination of higher free cash flow from operations, lower capital spending, and potential proceeds from asset sales, the Company anticipates reducing its leverage ratio (net debt to Adjusted EBITDA) to approximately three times by 2017. This plan will allow us to narrow our focus to businesses with the highest return and earnings growth potential. 

In our Titanium Technologies segment, we have a long-standing history of delivering high-quality TiO 2 &#32;pigment using our proprietary chloride technology. We are the largest global producer of TiO 2, and our low-cost network of manufacturing facilities allows us to efficiently and cost-effectively serve our global customer base. We expect to further enhance our operating cost advantage with the start up of our second production line at our Altamira, Mexico facility in 2016. Chemours is well positioned to remain the lowest cost TiO 2 &#32;producer and continue to meet our customers&#8217; growing needs around the world. 

In Fluoroproducts, we are one of two globally integrated producers making both fluorochemicals and fluoropolymers. In Fluorochemicals, we expect to market Opteon&#8482;, the world&#8217;s lowest global warming potential refrigerant, around the world as governments pass legislation that makes the use of low global warming potential refrigerants a requirement. We will also apply our application expertise across our fluoropolymers offerings, providing our customers with tailored products that have unique properties, including very high temperature resistance and high chemical resistance. We will continue to invest in research and development to remain a leader in these areas, and ensure that we are able to meet our customers needs as regulations change. 

In Chemical Solutions, we are investing in our cyanides business to increase capacity by 50 percent. This additional capacity will allow us to serve the growing demand for sodium cyanide in the gold mining industry in the Americas. We also made significant progress on our strategic review of our portfolio, including the announced sale of the Beaumont Aniline facility, planned exit of the Reactive Metals business, and decision to retain the Methylamines business. We plan to complete our strategic review of this segment in 2016, which is ultimately expected to result in a streamlined set of businesses with reduced capital requirements. 

We will maintain our commitment to responsible stewardship and safety for our employees, customers and the communities where we operate. Meeting and exceeding our customers&#8217; expectations while conducting business in accordance with our high ethical standards will continue to be a primary focus for our company as we continue to transform Chemours into a higher-value chemistry company. 

Segments 

Additional information on our segments can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Titanium Technologies Segment 

Segment Overview 

Chemours' Titanium Technologies segment is the leading global manufacturer of TiO 2 . TiO 2 &#32;is a pigment used to deliver whiteness, opacity, brightness and protection from sunlight in applications such as architectural and industrial coatings, flexible and rigid plastic packaging, PVC window profiles, laminate papers, coated paper and coated paperboard used for packaging. We sell our TiO 2 &#32;products under the Ti-Pure TM &#32;brand name to over 800 customers globally. We operate four TiO 2 &#32;production facilities: two in the United States (U.S.), one in Mexico and another in Taiwan. In addition, we have a large-scale repackaging and distribution facility in Belgium and operate a mineral sands mining operation in Starke, Florida. In total, we have a TiO 2 &#32;production capacity of 1.05 million metric tons per year. We are expanding our TiO 2 &#32;production facility in Altamira, Mexico which will increase our total TiO 2 &#32;production capacity to 1.25 million metric tons per year. 

Chemours is one of a limited number of producers operating a chloride process for the production of TiO 2 . We believe that our proprietary chloride technology enables us to operate plants at a much higher capacity than other chloride technology- based TiO 2 &#32;producers, uniquely utilizing a broad spectrum of titanium-bearing ore feedstocks and achieving the highest unit margins in our industry. This technology, which operates at all of our production facilities, provides us with one of the industry&#8217;s lowest manufacturing cost positions. Our research and development efforts focus on improving production processes and developing TiO 2 &#32;grades that help our customers achieve optimal performance in both their cost and product performance. 

Demand for TiO 2 &#32;comes from the coatings, paper and plastics industries and is highly correlated to growth in the global residential housing, commercial construction and packaging markets. Industry demand for TiO 2 &#32;is generally expected to be in line with global GDP, and can be cyclical due to economic and industry-specific market dynamics. 

A breakdown of our TiO 2 &#32;sales by region and end-market is shown in the charts below: 

* include specialty applications 

We sell approximately 20 different grades or forms of TiO 2 , each tailored for different applications to address undertone, dispersion and other application criteria for different end uses. 

We have operated a titanium mine in Starke, Florida since 1949. The mine provides us with access to a low cost source of domestic, high quality ilmenite feedstock and supplies less than ten percent of our feedstock consumption needs. Co-products of our mining operations are zircon (zirconium silicate) and staurolite minerals. We are a major supplier of high quality zircon in North America, primarily focused on the precision investment casting (PIC) industry, foundry and specialty applications, and ceramics. Our staurolite blasting abrasives, sold as Starblast&#8482;, are widely used in steel preparation and maintenance, and paint removal. 

Industry Overview and Competitors 

Worldwide effective capacity in 2015 was estimated to be approximately 6.5 million metric tons. This capacity base was more than sufficient to serve worldwide demand for TiO 2 &#32;in 2015 of approximately 5.5 million metric tons. 

The global TiO 2 &#32;market in which we operate is highly competitive. Competition is based primarily on product price, quality and technical service. We face competition from producers using the chloride process as well as those using the alternative sulfate process. Furthermore, due to the low cost of transporting TiO 2 , there is also competition between producers with production facilities located in different geographies, with some cost advantage belonging to the production facility that is closest to the customer. 

In most regions of the world, we compete primarily against large multinational producers such as The National Titanium Dioxide Company, Ltd. (Cristal), Huntsman International LLC, Kronos Worldwide, Inc. and Tronox Limited. In recent years, manufacturing capacity of those multinational producers has only modestly increased, primarily due to de-bottlenecking of the industry&#8217;s existing production facilities. Overall, in 2015, approximately 250,000 metric tons of capacity was taken offline and another approximately 170,000 metric tons were temporarily shut down due to worldwide oversupply of TiO 2 . 

In addition to these multinational producers, we also compete against numerous other producers, including producers in China, who, although generally having smaller facilities, have significantly expanded their TiO 2 &#32;production capacity over the last decade. Most Chinese producers utilize the sulfate process to produce a product line that, while cost competitive in China, is suitable principally for lower-end and limited mid-range applications. The quality differential and logistic considerations has limited the global export of TiO 2 &#32;produced in China to approximately 600 thousand metric tons in 2015, a decline of 3% from 2014. TZMI, an independent industry consultant, indicated that environmental factors and weak prices and margins contributed to the idling of capacity in China, some of which is likely to be permanent. The net permanent capacity reduction in China is estimated to be approximately 30,000 metric tons in 2015. In 2015, two of the largest Chinese domestic producers, Henan Billions and Lomon, announced their intention to merge. This transaction, currently under regulatory review, is believed to be a potential trend in China toward additional consolidation and more efficient production facilities. 

Raw Materials 

The primary raw materials used in the manufacture of TiO 2 &#32;are titanium-bearing ores, chlorine, calcined petroleum coke and energy. We source titanium-bearing ores from a number of suppliers around the globe, who are primarily located in Australia, South Africa, Canada and Mozambique. To ensure proper supply volume and to minimize pricing volatility, we generally enter into contracts in which volume is requirement-based and pricing is determined by a range of mechanisms structured to help us achieve competitive pricing relative to the market. We typically enter into a combination of long- and mid-term supply contracts and source our raw material from multiple suppliers across different regions and from multiple sites per supplier. Furthermore, we typically purchase multiple grades of ore from each supplier to limit our exposure to any single supplier for any single grade of ore in any given time period. Historically, we have not experienced any problems renewing such contracts for raw materials or securing our supply of titanium-bearing ores. 

We play an active role in ore source development around the globe, especially for those ores which can only be used by us, given the capability of our unique process technology. Supply chain flexibility allows for ore purchase and use optimization to manage short-term demand fluctuations and for long-term competitive advantage. Our process technology and ability to use lower grade ilmenite ore gives us the flexibility to alter our ore mix to the lowest cost configuration based on sales, demand and projected ore pricing. Lastly, we have taken steps to optimize routes for distribution and increase storage capacity at our production facilities. 

Transporting chlorine, one of our primary raw materials, can be costly. To reduce our exposure to this expense, we have a chlor-alkali production facility run by a third party that is co-located at our Johnsonville,Tennessee site, reducing our need to transport chlorine. Calcined petroleum coke is an important raw material input to our process. We source calcined petroleum coke from well-established suppliers in North America and China, typically under contracts that run multiple years to facilitate material and logistics planning through the supply chain. Distribution efficiency is enhanced through use of bulk ocean, barge and rail transportation modes. 

Energy is another key input cost into the TiO 2 &#32;manufacturing process, representing approximately 10 percent of the production cost. Chemours has access to natural gas based energy at our U.S. and Mexico TiO 2 &#32;production facilities and our Florida minerals plant, supporting advantaged energy costs given the low cost shale gas in the U.S. We continually evaluate investments to replace aging coal- and oil-based steam supply assets with natural gas at our sites. Natural gas-based cogeneration of steam and electricity is being extended as part of the major expansion at one of our TiO 2 &#32;production facilities. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

We sell the majority of our products through a direct sales force. We also utilize third-party sales agents and distributors to expand our reach. TiO 2 &#32; represents a significant raw material cost for our custom ers and as a result, purchasing decisions are often made by our customers&#8217; senior management team. Our sales organization works to develop and maintain close relationships with key decision makers in our value chain. 

In addition, our sales team and technical service team work together to develop relationships with all layers of our customers&#8217; organizations to ensure that we meet our customers&#8217; commercial and technical requirements. When appropriate, we collaborate closely with customers to solve formulation or application problems by modifying product characteristics or developing new product grades. 

To ensure an efficient distribution, we have a large fleet of railcars, which are predominantly used for outbound distribution of products in the U.S. and Canada. A dedicated logistics team, along with external partners, continually optimizes the assignment of our transportation equipment to product lines and geographic regions in order to maximize utilization and maintain an efficient supply chain. 

Customers 

Globally, we serve approximately 800 customers through our Titanium Technologies segment. In 2015, our ten largest Titanium Technologies customers accounted for approximately 30 percent of the segment&#8217;s sales. No single Titanium Technologies customer represented more than eight percent of our segment sales in 2015. Our larger customers in the U.S. and Europe are typically served through direct sales and tend to have medium- to long-term contracts with annual volume requirements and periodic price adjustment mechanisms. We serve our small- and mid-size customers through a combination of our direct sales and distribution network. 

Our direct customers in Titanium Technologies are producers of decorative coatings, automotive and industrial coatings, polyolefin masterbatches, polyvinylchloride window profiles, engineering polymers, laminate paper, coatings paper and coated paperboard. We focus on developing long-term partnerships with key market participants in each of these sectors. We also deliver a high level of technical service to satisfy our customers&#8217; specific needs, which helps us maintain strong customer relationships. 

Seasonality 

The demand for TiO 2 &#32;is subject to seasonality because certain applications, such as decorative coatings, are influenced by weather conditions or holiday seasons. As a result, our TiO 2 &#32;sales volume is typically lowest in the first quarter, highest in the second and third quarters and moderate in the fourth quarter. This pattern applies to the entire TiO 2 &#32;market, but may vary by region, country or application. It can also be altered by economic or other demand cycles. 

Fluoroproducts Segment 

Segment Overview 

Our Fluoroproducts segment is the global leader in providing fluorine-based, advanced material solutions. The segment creates products that have unique properties such as high temperature resistance, high chemical resistance and unique di-electric properties for applications across a broad array of industries. We are the global leader in providing fluoroproducts, such as refrigerants and industrial fluoropolymer resins and derivatives. We have a leading position in hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants and are a leader in the development of sustainable technologies like Opteon&#8482;, a line of low Global Warming Potential (GWP) hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) refrigerants and foam expansion agents, which also have a zero ozone depletion footprint. Opteon&#8482; was jointly developed with Honeywell International, Inc., in response to the European Union's (EU) Mobile Air Conditioning (MAC) Directive. This new patented technology offers similar functionality to current HFC products but meets or exceeds currently mandated environmental standards. We are the market leader in fluoropolymer resins and downstream products and coatings, marketed under the well-known Teflon TM &#32;brand name. Teflon TM &#32;industrial resins are used in high-performance wire and cable and multiple components in high-tech processing equipment. 

We led the industry in the Montreal-Protocol (1987) driven transition from chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to the lesser ozone depleting hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and non-ozone depleting HFCs. In 1988, we committed to cease production of CFCs and started manufacturing non-ozone depleting HFCs in the early 1990s. Driven by new and emerging environmental legislations and standards currently being implemented across the U.S., Europe, Latin America and Japan, we are now commercializing Opteon&#8482; and we expect increased adoption through 2017. Over the years, regulation has pushed the industry to evolve and respond to environmental concerns. We have and will continue to invest in research and development to ensure that we remain a leader and 

are able to meet our customers needs as regulations change. We are the market leader in fluoropolymer resins and downstream products and coatings, marketed under the Teflon TM &#32;brand. 

The manufacturing of fluoroproducts is complex and involves intermediates that are highly corrosive and hazardous in complex processes. We have an industry-leading safety culture and apply world-class technical expertise to ensure that our operations are run safely and reliably. These capabilities also enable us to continuously improve production yields, reduce unplanned downtime and increase our throughput, which in turn improves our overall manufacturing efficiency and customer responsiveness. 

Our capacity, innovative production processes, effective supply chain and sourcing strategies make us highly cost competitive in the fluoroproducts market. We use local contract manufacturing and joint venture partners in selected countries as a source of regional access and asset-light manufacturing to further enhance the overall cost position of our Fluoroproducts segment. 

A breakdown of the Fluoroproducts segment's 2015 sales by region and product group is shown in the charts below: 

We sell fluoroproducts through two product groups: Fluorochemicals and Fluoropolymers. Fluorochemicals products include refrigerants, foam expansion agents, propellants and fire extinguishants. Fluoropolymers products include various industrial fluoropolymer resins, and serve a wide range of industrial and end-user applications spanning from wearable electronics to automotive, network cables, pipe lining and gaskets, corrosion resistance, surface protections, non-stick adhesion and thermal stability, among others. Fluorochemicals' refrigerant sales fluctuate by season as sales in the first half of the year generally are 

slightly higher than sales in the second half of the year; however, shifts in the product portfolio in recent quarters have partially offset this impact. 

Industry Overview and Competitors 

Our Fluoroproducts segment competes against a broad variety of global manufacturers, including Honeywell, Arkema, Mexichem, Daikin, Solvay and Dyneon, as well as local Chinese and Indian manufacturers. We have a leadership position in fluorine chemistry and materials science, a broad scope and scale of operations, market driven application development and deep customer knowledge. 

Chemours has global leadership positions in the following fluoroproduct categories as set forth in the table below:

Fluoroproducts demand growth is expected to be in line with growth in global GDP. Growth may expected to be higher than GDP in situations where, for environmental reasons, regulatory drivers constrain the market or drive the market toward lower global warming alternatives. Developed markets represent the largest fluoroproducts markets today. Middle class growth and the increasing demand for consumer electronics, telecommunications, automobiles, refrigerators, air conditioners and expanding infrastructure are all key drivers of increased demand for various fluoroproducts. 

Raw Materials 

The primary raw materials required to support the Fluoroproducts segment are fluorspar, chlorinated organics, chlorinated inorganics, hydrofluoric acid and vinylidene fluoride. These are available in many countries and not concentrated in any particular region. 

Our supply chains are designed for maximum competitiveness through advantaged sourcing of key raw materials. Starting with our sourcing agreements, we use a mixture of fixed and market-based pricing and are covered by contracts with terms that span from two to ten years, except for purchases for resale from China that are negotiated on a monthly basis. Most qualified Fluorspar sources have market-based pricing. Although the fluoroproduct industry has historically relied primarily on fluorspar exports from China, Chemours has diversified its sourcing through multiple geographic regions and suppliers to ensure a stable and cost competitive supply. Our current supply agreements are generally in effect through 2020. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

With more than 85 years of innovation and development in fluorine science, our technical, marketing and sales teams around the world have deep expertise in our products and their end-uses. We work with customers to select the appropriate fluoroproducts to meet their technical performance needs. We sell our products through direct channels and through resellers. Selling agreements vary by product line and markets served and include both spot pricing arrangements and longer term contracts with a typical duration of one year. 

We maintain a large fleet of railcars, tank trucks and containers to deliver our products and support our supply chain needs. For the portion of the fleet that is leased, related lease terms are usually staggered, which provides us with a competitive cost position as well as the ability to adjust the size of our fleet in response to changes in market conditions. A dedicated logistics team, along with external partners, continually optimizes the assignment of our transportation equipment to product lines and geographic regions in order to maximize utilization and flexibility of the supply chain. 

Customers 

We serve approximately 4,000 customers and distributors globally and in many instances these commercial relationships have been in place for decades. No single Fluoroproducts customer represented more than 10 percent of the segment's sales in 2015. 

Seasonality 

Seasonality in Fluorochemicals sales is driven by increased demand for residential, commercial and automotive air conditioning in the spring. This demand peaks in the summer months and declines in the fall and winter. Commercial refrigeration demand is fairly steady throughout the year, but demand is slightly higher during the summer months. There is no significant seasonality for Fluoropolymers, as demand is relatively consistent throughout the year. 

Chemical Solutions Segment 

Segment Overview 

Our Chemical Solutions segment comprises a diverse portfolio of industrial and specialty chemical businesses primarily operating in the Americas. The Chemical Solutions segment&#8217;s products are used as important raw materials and catalysts for a diverse group of industries including, among others, gold production, oil refining, agriculture and industrial polymers. We are a leading North American provider of several Chemical Solutions products, including sodium cyanide and sulfuric acid. Chemical Solutions generates value through the use of market leading manufacturing technology, safety performance and product stewardship, and differentiated logistics capabilities. 

As part of our transformation plan, we announced a strategic review of our Chemical Solutions segment, excluding Cyanides. In November 2015, we announced the sale of our Aniline facility in Beaumont, Texas to The Dow Chemical Company, subject to customary approvals and closing conditions, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016. We also made significant progress on our strategic review of our portfolio, including the announced planned exit of the Reactive Metals business and decision to retain and improve the cost position of our Methylamines business. The remainder of our Chemical Solutions assets are still under strategic review, and we expect to conclude the process in 2016. 

Chemical Solutions operates at 13 &#32;dedicated production facilities, which are primarily concentrated in North America. Chemical Solutions sells products and solutions through three primary product groups: Cyanides, Sulfur Products, and Performance Chemicals &#38; Intermediates. Performance Chemicals &#38; Intermediates business includes a number of product lines including Clean &#38; Disinfect chemicals, Aniline, Methylamines, Glycolic Acid, Vazo&#8482; free radical initiators and Reactive Metals. Our Chemical Solutions segment serves customers in a diverse range of end markets that we expect to generally grow in line with growth in global GDP. 

A breakdown of Chemical Solutions&#8217; 2015 sales by region and primary product groups is shown in the charts below. 

We sell products through three primary product groups. The Cyanides product group includes sodium cyanide, hydrogen cyanide and potassium cyanide. We are the market leader in solid sodium cyanide production in the Americas, which is used primarily by the mining industry for gold and silver production. The U.S.-based Sulfur Products group is a leading producer of both non-fuming sulfuric acid products and higher value sulfur derivative products (HVSDs) such as oleum, sulfur trioxide and chlorosulfonic acid. This product group also provides spent acid regeneration and sulfur gas recovery services to the oil refining industry, where our merchant regeneration capacity is ranked #1 and #2 in the U.S. Northeast and Gulf Coast regions, respectively. In the Performance Chemicals and Intermediates product group, we manufacture a wide variety of chemicals used in many different applications such as water treatment, cleaning (household, institutional and industrial), agricultural chemicals, textiles and electronics. 

Industry Overview and Competitors 

The industrial and specialty chemicals produced by our Chemical Solutions segment are important raw materials for a wide range of industries and end markets. We hold a long standing reputation for high quality and the safe handling of hazardous products such as sodium cyanide and sulfuric acid. We believe that we have leading cost positions in cyanides, sulfur products and our clean and disinfect products. Our competitive cost positions in these products are the result of our process technology, manufacturing scale, efficient supply chain and proximity to large customers. Our Chemical Solutions segment also holds, and occasionally licenses, what we believe to be the leading process technologies for the production of hydrogen and sodium cyanide, which are used in industrial polymers and in gold production.

United Initiators 

Raw Materials 

Key raw materials for Chemical Solutions include ammonia, methanol, sulfur, natural gas, formaldehyde, hydrogen and caustic soda. We source raw materials from global and regional suppliers where possible and maintain multiple supplier relationships to protect against supply disruptions and potential price increases. To further mitigate the risk of raw material availability and cost fluctuation, Chemical Solutions has also taken steps to optimize routes for distribution, increase the storage capacity at our production facilities, lock in long-term contracts with key suppliers and increase the number of customer contracts with raw material price pass-through terms. We do not believe that the loss of any particular supplier would be material to our business. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

Our technical, marketing and sales teams around the world have deep expertise with our products and their end markets. We predominantly sell directly to customers, although we also use a network of distributors for specific product lines and geographies. Sales may take place through either spot transactions or via long-term contracts. 

Most of Chemical Solutions&#8217; raw materials and products can be delivered by efficient bulk transportation. As such, we maintain a large fleet of railcars, tank trucks and containers to support our supply chain needs. For the portion of the fleet that is leased, related lease terms are usually staggered, which provides us with a competitive cost position as well as the ability to adjust the size of our container fleet in response to changes in market conditions. A dedicated logistics team, along with external partners, continually optimizes the assignment of our transportation equipment to product lines and geographic regions in order to maximize utilization and flexibility of the supply chain. 

The strategic placement of our production facilities in locations designed to serve our key customer base gives us robust distribution capabilities. 

Customers 

Our Chemical Solutions segment focuses on developing long-term partnerships with key market participants. Many of our commercial and industrial relationships have been in place for decades and are based on our proven value proposition of safely and reliably supplying our customers with the materials needed for their operations. Our reputation and long-term track record is a key competitive advantage as several of the products&#8217; end users demand the highest level of excellence in safe manufacturing, distribution, handling and storage. Chemical Solutions has a Department of Transportation Special Permits and Approvals in place for distribution of various materials associated with each of our business lines as required. Our Chemical Solutions segment serves over a thousand customers globally. The largest Chemical Solutions customer represented approximately 10 percent of segment sales in 2015. 

Seasonality 

Our sales are subject to minimal seasonality. Our Sulfur Products business is influenced by seasonal fluctuations because in the summer months we typically sell a higher volume of acid due to oil refinery customers operating at higher capacities. 

Intellectual Property 

Intellectual property, including trade secrets, certain patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how and other proprietary rights, is a critical part of maintaining our technology leadership and competitive edge. Our business strategy is to file patent and trademark applications globally for proprietary new product and application development technologies. We hold many patents, particularly in our Fluoroproducts segment, as described herein. These patents, including various patents that expire during the period of 2016 to 2034, in the aggregate, are believed to be of material importance to our business. However, we believe that no single patent (or related group of patents) is material in relation to our business as a whole. In addition, particularly in our Titanium Technologies segment, we hold significant intellectual property in the form of trade secrets and, while we believe that no single trade secret is material in relation to our combined business as a whole, we believe they are material in the aggregate. Unlike patents, trade secrets do not have a predetermined validity period, but are valid indefinitely, so long as their secrecy is maintained. We work actively on a global basis to create, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. The protection afforded by these patents and trademarks varies based on country, scope of individual patent and trademark coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country. Although certain proprietary intellectual property rights are important to the success of our company, we do not believe that we are materially dependent on any particular patent or trademark. We believe that securing our intellectual property is critical to maintaining our technology leadership and our competitive position, especially with respect to new technologies or the extensions of existing technologies. Our proprietary process technology is also a source of incremental income through licensing arrangements. 

Our Titanium Technologies segment in particular relies upon unpatented proprietary knowledge and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position in this space. Our proprietary chloride production process is an important part of our technology and our business could be harmed if our trade secrets are not maintained in confidence. In our Titanium Technologies intellectual property portfolio, we consider our trademark Ti-Pure TM &#32;to be a valuable asset and have registered this trademark in a number of countries. 

Our Fluoroproducts segment is the technology leader in the markets in which it participates. We have one of the largest patent portfolios in the fluorine derivatives industry. In our Fluoroproducts intellectual property portfolio, we consider our Freon TM , Opteon TM , Teflon TM , Viton TM &#32;and Krytox TM &#32;trademarks to be valuable assets. 

Our Chemical Solutions segment is a manufacturing and application development technology leader in a majority of the markets in which it participates. In our Chemical Solutions intellectual property portfolio, we consider our Virkon TM &#32;and Oxone TM &#32;trademarks to be valuable assets. Trade secrets are one of the key elements of our intellectual property security in Chemical Solutions as most of the segment&#8217;s manufacturing and application development technologies are no longer under patent coverage. 

At separation, certain of our subsidiaries entered into an intellectual property cross-license agreement with DuPont, pursuant to which (i) DuPont has agreed to license to Chemours certain patents, know-how and technical information owned by DuPont or its affiliates and necessary or useful in Chemours&#8217; business, and (ii) Chemours has agreed to license to DuPont certain patents owned by Chemours or its affiliates and necessary or useful in DuPont&#8217;s business. In most circumstances, the licenses are perpetual, irrevocable, sublicenseable (in connection with the party&#8217;s business), assignable (in connection with a sale of the applicable portion of a party&#8217;s business or assets, subject to certain exceptions) worldwide licenses in connection with the current operation of the businesses and, with respect to specified products and fields of use, future operation of such businesses, subject to certain limitations with respect to specified products and fields of use. 

Research and Development 

We perform research and development activities in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the Fluoroproducts segment. The Fluoroproducts segment efforts center on developing new sustainable fluorochemicals and new applications and formulations for fluoropolymers that meet customers&#8217; technical requirements. In Titanium Technologies and Chemical Solutions, our efforts are focused on process technology to reduce cost and maintain safety and stewardship standards. The table below sets forth the last three years of research and development expense by segment:

Backlog 

In general, the Company does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders and does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, the Company believes that backlog information is not material to understanding its overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.
