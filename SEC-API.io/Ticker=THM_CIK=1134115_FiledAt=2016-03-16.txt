 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

ITH is a mineral exploration company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. The Company currently holds or has the right to acquire interests in an advanced stage exploration project in Alaska referred to as the &#8220;Livengood Gold Project&#8221; or the &#8220;Project&#8221;. The Company is in the process of optimizing the Livengood Gold Project as discussed below. The Company has not yet begun preparation for the extraction of mineralization from the deposit or reached commercial production. The Company controls 100% of the Livengood Gold Project, which has a mineral resource of 731 million measured tonnes at an average grade of 0.61 g/tonne (14.4 million ounces at 0.3 g/tonne cut-off), 71 million indicated tonnes at an average grade of 0.56 g/tonne (1.3 million ounces at 0.3 g/tonne cut-off) and 266 million inferred tonnes at an average grade of 0.52 g/tonne (4.4 million ounces at 0.3 g/tonne cut-off). In 2013 the Company issued the results of a feasibility study that was summarized in the September 2013 Study which converted a portion of the mineral resources at the Project into proven reserves of 434 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.69 g/tonne (9.6 million ounces) and probable reserves of 20 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.70 g/tonne (454,000 ounces) based on a gold price of $1,500 per ounce. All work presently planned by the Company is directed at maintaining necessary environmental baseline activities at the Livengood Gold Project and focusing efforts on Project optimization opportunities, including those identified in the September 2013 Study and those subsequently developed by the Company . A more complete description of the Livengood Gold Project and the current activities is set forth in Part II, Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

Since 2006, the Company has focused primarily on the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties in Alaska and Nevada by acquiring through staking, purchase, lease or option (primarily from AngloGold Ashanti (U.S.A.) Exploration Inc. (&#8220;AngloGold&#8221;) in a transaction which closed on August 4, 2006) interests in a number of mineral properties in Alaska (Livengood Gold Project, Terra, LMS, BMP, Chisna, Coffee Dome, West Tanana, Gilles, West Pogo, Caribou, Blackshell and South Estelle) and Nevada (North Bullfrog and Painted Hills) that it believed had the potential to host large precious or base metal deposits. Some of these, such as the Painted Hills, Gilles, West Tanana, Caribou and Blackshell properties, were, in light of disappointing exploration results, dropped or returned to the respective optionors or lessors, and the associated costs written off while others, such as the South Estelle property, have been sold. Since early 2008, the Company&#8217;s primary focus has been the exploration and advancement of the Livengood Gold Project and the majority of its resources have been directed to that end. In August 2010, ITH undertook a corporate spin-out arrangement transaction whereby all of its mineral property interests other than the Project were transferred to Corvus and Corvus was spun out as an independent and separate public company. Following the completion of that transaction, the sole mineral property held by the Company is the Livengood Gold Project. Since the completion of such transaction, the Company has focused exclusively on the ongoing exploration and potential development of the Livengood Gold Project.

&#160;

The head office and principal administrative address of ITH is located at Suite 2300 &#8211; 1177 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6E 2K3, and its registered and records office is located at 1300 &#8211; 777 Dunsmuir Street, Vancouver, BC V7Y 1K2.

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

Livengood Gold Project Developments 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 and to the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company progressed on a number of opportunities identified in the September 2013 Study and opportunities subsequently developed by the Company with the potential for optimization and reducing the costs of building and operating a mine at the Project. Outside consultants were retained to conduct additional metallurgical tests and engineering, including confirmation of the flow sheet and optimizing the operating costs. These inputs are being used in a throughput rationalization study to evaluate and optimize the Project configuration and capital costs, including determination of the optimum scale for the Livengood Gold Project. During 2015, the Company evaluated an alternative for fresh water supply and continued to advance environmental baseline work in support of future permitting in order to better position the Project for a construction decision when warranted by market conditions.

&#160;

Management Changes 

&#160; 

On March 26, 2015, the Company appointed Karl Hanneman as its Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Hanneman most recently has been serving as General Manager for the Company. Mr. Hanneman has been with the Company since May 2010, during which time he was responsible for assembling the Alaska team and served as the Livengood Gold Project Manager.

&#160;

On May 11, 2015, the Company contracted with David Cross to serve as its Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Cross is a partner in the firm of Cross Davis &#38; Company LLP, Chartered Professional Accountants, which has also been retained by the Company to provide corporate accounting support. Mr. Cross replaces Tom Yip who resigned as Chief Financial Officer effective December 31, 2014 and subsequently provided transitional financial services up to May 31, 2015 as a consultant to the Company.

&#160;

2016 Outlook 

&#160;

During 2016, the Company plans to complete the evaluation of opportunities as identified in the September 2013 Study and those subsequently developed by the Company for optimization and reducing Project costs. The Company will also pursue additional opportunities that might arise out of the current work. The Company also plans to continue critical baseline environmental studies to maintain the integrity of eight years of historical data already compiled.

&#160;

2015 Metallurgical, Field, and Engineering Work 

&#160;

Due to the potential importance of the head grade evaluation performed during 2014, a significant multi-phase metallurgical test work program was initiated in an attempt to validate the observed higher calculated head grades. For subsequent phases of this program, bulk samples of several thousand kilograms of each of the major rock types were selected and shipped for laboratory testing. The objectives of the 2015 metallurgical test program were to:

&#160;

&#183; Optimize the gravity circuit 

&#183; Optimize the grind size and power consumption 

&#183; Optimize the reagent consumption 

&#183; Optimize the leach retention time 

&#183; Confirm the overall recoveries by rock type 

&#183; Provide additional confirmation of the Project head grades. &#160;

Review of the feasibility test work to date continues to indicate that there is a potential that further optimization of the parameters noted above could result in capital and operating expenditure reductions for the Project. However, until this multi-phase metallurgical program has been completed, there can be no assurance that the head grade differences observed to date, or the potential process optimizations and cost savings opportunities identified, will in fact be realized. 

&#160; 

Field work was completed to evaluate possible alternatives for the required fresh water supply with the potential to reduce Project costs. A 30 day pump test confirmed the presence of a large aquifer at the Project that is capable of supplying water for the mill at what is expected to be a much reduced capital cost as compared to that incorporated into the September 2013 Study. The Company also continued to advance environmental baseline work in support of future permitting in order to better position the Project for a potential construction decision when warranted by market conditions.

&#160;

8&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Once the test work and field work are completed and the process costs are better defined, these costs will then serve as input to an engineering phase that will evaluate and optimize the Project configuration and capital and operating expenditures, including determining the optimum scale for the Project, any of which may be different than that assumed in the September 2013 Study.

&#160;

The Company remains open to a strategic alliance to help support the future development of the Project while considering all other appropriate financing options. The size of the gold resource, the favorable location, and the proven team are some of the reasons the Company would potentially attract a strategic partner with a long term development horizon who understands the Project is highly leveraged to gold prices.

&#160; 

Regulatory, Environmental and Social Matters 

&#160;

All of the Company&#8217;s currently proposed exploration is under the jurisdiction of the State of Alaska. In Alaska, low impact, initial stage surface exploration such as stream sediment, soil and rock chip sampling does not require any permits. The State of Alaska requires an APMA (Alaska Placer Mining Application) exploration permit for all substantial surface disturbances such as trenching, road building and drilling. These permits are also reviewed by related state and federal agencies that can comment and require specific changes to the proposed work plans to minimize impacts on the environment. The permitting process for significant disturbances generally requires 30 days for processing and all work must be bonded. The Company currently has all necessary permits with respect to its exploration activities in Alaska. Although the Company has never had an issue with the timely processing of APMA permits, there can be no assurances that delays in permit approval will not occur.

&#160;

ITH has created a Technical Committee, which has adopted a formal, written charter. As set out in its charter, the overall purpose of the Technical Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the Company&#8217;s continuing commitment to improving the environment and ensuring that activities are carried out and facilities are operated and maintained in a safe and environmentally sound manner that reflects the ideals and principles of sustainable development. The primary function of the Technical Committee is to monitor, review and provide oversight with respect to the technical aspects of the Company&#8217;s projects as well as monitor policies, standards, accountabilities and programs relative to health, safety, community relations and environmental-related matters. The Technical Committee also advises the Board and makes recommendations for the Board&#8217;s consideration regarding health, safety, community relations and environmental-related issues.

&#160;

Although not set out in a specific policy, the Company strives to be a positive influence in the local communities where its mineral projects are located, not only by contributing to the welfare of such communities through donations of money and supplies, as appropriate, but also through hiring, when appropriate, local workers to assist in ongoing exploration programs. The Company considers building and maintaining strong relationships with such communities to be fundamental to its ability to continue to operate in such regions and to assist in the eventual development (if any) of mining operations in such regions, and it attaches considerable importance to commencing and fostering such relationships from the beginning of its involvement in any particular area.

&#160;

Corporate Structure 

&#160;

ITH was incorporated under the Company Act (British Columbia) under the name &#8220;Ashnola Mining Company Ltd.&#8221; on May 26, 1978. ITH&#8217;s name was changed to &#8220;Tower Hill Mines Ltd.&#8221; on June 1, 1988, and subsequently changed to &#8220;International Tower Hill Mines Ltd.&#8221; on March 15, 1991. ITH has been transitioned under, and is now governed by, the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). On November 15, 2005, the shareholders resolved to amend the Company&#8217;s Articles to increase its authorized capital from 20,000,000 common shares without par value to 500,000,000 common shares without par value. This increase became effective on April 20, 2006.

&#160;

ITH has three material subsidiaries:

&#160;

&#183; Tower Hill Mines, Inc. (&#8220;TH Alaska&#8221;), a corporation incorporated in Alaska on June 27, 2006, which holds most of the Company&#8217;s Alaskan mineral properties and is 100% owned by ITH; &#160;

&#183; Tower Hill Mines (US) LLC, a limited liability company formed in Colorado on June 27, 2006, which carries on the Company&#8217;s administrative and personnel functions and is wholly owned by TH Alaska; and &#160;

9&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Livengood Placers, Inc., a corporation incorporated in Nevada on June 11, 1998, which holds certain Alaskan properties and is 100% owned by TH Alaska. &#160;

The following corporate chart sets forth all of ITH&#8217;s material subsidiaries:

Segment and Geographical Information 

&#160; 

The Company operates in a single reportable operating segment, being the exploration and development of mineral properties. The Company&#8217;s long-lived assets are geographically distributed as shown in the following table. The Company did not have revenues from external customers in any of the years shown below.

Competition 

&#160;

ITH is an exploration stage company. The Company competes with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing, technical expertise and the acquisition of mineral properties. Many of the companies with whom the Company competes have greater financial and technical resources. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. This competition could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for the Company to develop its mineral properties.

&#160;

Availability of Raw Materials and Skilled Employees 

&#160; 

All aspects of the Company&#8217;s business require specialized skills and knowledge. Such skills and knowledge include the areas of geology, drilling, logistical planning, preparation of feasibility studies, permitting, construction and operation of a mine, financing and accounting. Since commencing its current operations in mid-2006, the Company has found and retained appropriate employees and consultants and believes it will continue to be able to do so.

&#160;

All of the raw materials the Company requires to carry on its business are readily available through normal supply or business contracting channels in Canada and the United States. Since commencing exploration activities at the Livengood Gold Project in mid-2006, the Company has been able to secure the appropriate personnel, equipment and supplies required to conduct its contemplated programs. While it has experienced difficulty in procuring some equipment, such as drill equipment or services, experienced drillers and timely assay laboratory services in previous years, the recent overall slowdown in the mineral exploration business has resulted in more equipment and services being made available on a timely basis. As a result, the Company does not believe that it will experience any shortages of required personnel, equipment or supplies in the foreseeable future.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, the Company had 10 full-time employees. The Company also uses consultants with specific skills to assist with various aspects of project evaluation, engineering and corporate governance.

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160;

As the Company&#8217;s mineral exploration activity takes place in Alaska, its business is seasonal. Due to the northern climate, exploration work on the Livengood Gold Project can be limited due to excessive snow cover and cold temperatures. In general, surface sampling work is limited to May through September and surface drilling from March through November, although some locations afford opportunities for year-round exploration operations and others, such as road-accessible wetland areas, may only be explored while frozen in the winter.
