PART I 

&#32;Item 1. Business 

General 

Ensco plc is a global offshore contract drilling company. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms "Ensco," "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer to Ensco plc together with all its subsidiaries and predecessors. 

We are one of the leading providers of offshore contract drilling services to the international oil and gas industry. 

We own and operate an offshore drilling rig fleet of 64 &#32;rigs spanning most of the strategic markets around the globe. Our rig fleet includes ten drillships, 13 &#32;dynamically positioned semisubmersible rigs, three &#32;moored semisubmersible rigs and 42 &#32;jackup rigs, including four &#32;rigs under construction. Our fleet is the world's second largest amongst competitive rigs, our ultra-deepwater fleet is one of the newest in the industry, and our premium jackup fleet is the largest of any offshore drilling company. 

Our customers include many of the leading national and international oil companies, in addition to many independent operators. We are among the most geographically diverse offshore drilling companies, with current operations spanning approximately 15 countries on six &#32;continents. The markets in which we operate include the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Mexico, Brazil, the Mediterranean, the North Sea, the Middle East, West Africa, Australia and Southeast Asia. 

We provide drilling services on a "day rate" contract basis. Under day rate contracts, we provide a drilling rig and rig crews and receive a fixed amount per day for each day we are performing drilling or related services. Our customers bear substantially all of the costs of constructing the well and supporting drilling operations, as well as the economic risk relative to the success of the well. In addition, our customers may pay all or a portion of the cost of moving our equipment and personnel to and from the well site. 

Ensco plc is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Our principal executive office is located at 6 Chesterfield Gardens, London W1J5BQ, England, United Kingdom, and our telephone number is +44 (0) 20 7659 4660. Our website is www.enscoplc.com. Information contained on our website is not included as part of, or incorporated by reference into, this report. 

Acquisitions 

We have grown our rig fleet through corporate acquisitions and new rig construction. A total of seven drillships, eight semisubmersible rigs and 25 jackup rigs in our current fleet were obtained through the acquisitions of Penrod Holding Corporation during 1993, Dual Drilling Company during 1996, Chiles Offshore Inc. during 2002 and Pride International, Inc. ("Pride") during 2011. &#160; 

Drilling Rig Construction and Delivery 

We remain focused on our long-established strategy of high-grading our fleet. We will continue to invest in the expansion of our fleet where we believe strategic opportunities exist. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2015 , we invested approximately $3.2 billion &#32;in the construction of new drilling rigs. 

During 2014, we entered into an agreement with Lamprell Energy Limited to construct two premium jackup rigs. ENSCO 140 and ENSCO 141 are significantly enhanced versions of the LeTorneau Super 116E jackup design and will incorporate Ensco's patented Canti-Leverage Advantage SM &#32;technology. These rigs are scheduled for delivery during the second quarter and the third quarter of 2016, respectively. Both of these rigs are currently uncontracted. 

During 2013, we entered into agreements with Keppel FELS ("KFELS") to construct a premium jackup rig (ENSCO 110) and an ultra-premium harsh environment jackup rig (ENSCO 123). ENSCO 110 was delivered during the second quarter of 2015 and commenced drilling operations under a long-term contract in the UAE. We recently 

agreed with the shipyard to delay delivery of ENSCO 123 until the first quarter of 2018. ENSCO 123 is currently uncontracted. 

We previously entered into agreements with KFELS to construct three ultra-premium harsh environment jackup rigs (ENSCO 120, ENSCO 121 and ENSCO 122). ENSCO 122 was delivered during the third quarter of 2014 and commenced drilling operations under a long-term contract in the North Sea during the fourth quarter of 2014. ENSCO 121 was delivered during the fourth quarter of 2013 and commenced drilling operations under a long-term contract in the North Sea during the second quarter of 2014. ENSCO 120 was delivered during the third quarter of 2013 and commenced drilling operations under a long-term contract in the North Sea during the first quarter of 2014. 

We previously entered into agreements with Samsung Heavy Industries to construct three ultra-deepwater drillships (ENSCO DS-8, ENSCO DS-9 and ENSCO DS-10). ENSCO DS-10 is currently uncontracted and we agreed with the shipyard to delay the delivery until the first quarter of 2017. During 2015, we accepted delivery of ENSCO DS-8 and ENSCO DS-9. ENSCO DS-8 was delivered during the third quarter and commenced drilling operations under a long-term contract in Angola. ENSCO DS-9 was delivered in the second quarter and is uncontracted following receipt of a notice of termination for convenience from our customer. Under the terms of the contract, our customer is obligated to pay us termination fees, which are payable monthly, of two years of operating day rate (approximately $550,000), which will be reduced pursuant to our obligation to mitigate idle rig costs, such as manning and maintenance activity, while the rig is idle and without a contract. We are in discussions with our customer on the amount of this reduction. This day rate may also be adjusted if we recontract the rig. 

Based on our balance sheet and contractual backlog of $5.8 billion , we believe our remaining capital commitments will primarily be funded from cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, operating cash flows and, if necessary, funds borrowed under our revolving credit facility. We may decide to access debt and/or equity markets to raise additional capital or increase liquidity as necessary. 

Divestitures 

Our business strategy has been to focus on ultra-deepwater floater and premium jackup operations and de-emphasize other assets and operations that are not part of our long-term strategic plan or that no longer meet our standards for economic returns. Consistent with this strategy, we sold eight &#32;jackup rigs and three &#32;moored semisubmersible rigs during the three-year period ended December 31, 2015 . We are marketing for sale six &#32;rigs, which were classified as held-for-sale in our financial statements as of December 31, 2015 . In February 2016, we determined that an additional six rigs - ENSCO 56, ENSCO 81, ENSCO 82, ENSCO 86, ENSCO 99 and ENSCO DS-1 - would likely be scrapped or otherwise retired. 

Redomestication 

Our predecessor, ENSCO International Incorporated ("Ensco Delaware"), was formed as a Texas corporation during 1975 and reincorporated in Delaware during 1987. During 2009, we completed a reorganization of the corporate structure of the group of companies controlled by Ensco Delaware, pursuant to which an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary merged with Ensco Delaware, and Ensco plc became our publicly-held parent company incorporated under the Laws of England and Wales (the "redomestication"). 

We remain subject to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") reporting requirements, the mandates of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the applicable corporate governance rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). We continue to report our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"), but also comply with reporting requirements under English law. 

Contract Drilling Operations &#160; &#160; 

Our business consists of three operating segments: (1) Floaters, which includes our drillships and semisubmersible rigs, (2) Jackups and (3) Other, which consists of management services on rigs owned by third-parties. Our two reportable segments, Floaters and Jackups, provide one service, contract drilling. 

We currently own and operate an offshore drilling rig fleet of 64 &#32;rigs. We also have four &#32;rigs under construction. Our rig fleet includes ten drillships (including one drillship under construction), 13 &#32;dynamically positioned semisubmersible rigs, three &#32;moored semisubmersible rigs and 42 &#32;jackup rigs (including three rigs under construction). Of our 68 &#32;rigs, 30 &#32;are located in the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific (including four &#32;rigs under construction), 21 &#32;are currently located in North and South America (including Brazil) and 17 &#32;are located in Europe and the Mediterranean. 

&#160; 

Our drilling rigs drill and complete oil and natural gas wells. From time to time, our drilling rigs may be utilized as accommodation units or for non-drilling services, such as workovers and interventions. Demand for our drilling services is based upon many factors beyond our control. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors - The success of our business largely depends on the level of activities in the oil and gas industry, which can be significantly affected by volatile oil and natural gas prices.&#8221; 

Our drilling contracts are the result of negotiations with our customers, and most contracts are awarded upon competitive bidding. The terms of our drilling contracts can vary significantly, but generally contain the following commercial terms: 

&#8226; 

contract duration or term for a specific period of time or a period necessary to drill one or more wells, &#160; 

&#8226; 

term extension options in favor of our customer, exercisable upon advance notice to us, at mutually agreed, indexed, fixed rates or current rate at the date of extension, &#160; 

&#8226; 

provisions permitting early termination of the contract (i) if the rig is lost or destroyed, (ii) by the customer if operations are suspended for a specified period of time due to breakdown of major rig equipment, unsatisfactory performance, or "force majeure" events beyond the control of either party or (iii) at the convenience (without cause) of the customer (in most cases obligating the customer to pay us an early termination fee providing some level of compensation to us for the remaining term), 

&#8226; 

payment of compensation to us (generally in U.S. dollars although some contracts require a portion of the compensation to be paid in local currency) on a "day work" basis such that we receive a fixed amount for each day ("day rate") that the drilling unit is operating under contract (lower rates, shorter periods that a rate is payable or no payments ("zero rate") generally apply during periods of equipment breakdown and repair, during re-drilling lost or damaged portions of wells or suspension of operations due to negligence or in the event operations are suspended or interrupted due to unsatisfactory performance or other specified conditions), 

&#8226; 

payment by us of the operating expenses of the drilling unit, including crew labor and incidental rig supply and maintenance costs, 

&#8226; 

mobilization and demobilization requirements of us to move the drilling unit to and from the planned drilling site, and such terms may include reimbursement of these costs by the customer by in the form of up-front payment, additional day rate over the contract term, or direct reimbursement, and 

&#8226; 

provisions allowing us to recover certain labor and other operating cost increases, and certain cost increases due to changes in applicable law, from our customers through day rate adjustment or direct reimbursement. 

Due to the current depressed market conditions, we are seeing intense pressure on negotiation of operating day rates, which may result in rates that approximate direct operating expenses. In addition, we are seeing increased 

pressure to accept other less favorable contractual and commercial terms, including reduced or no mobilization and demobilization fees, reduced day rates during downtime, reduced standby, redrill and moving rates, caps on reimbursements for downhole tools, reduced periods to remediate equipment breakdowns or other deviations from contractual standards of performance, certain limitations on our ability to be indemnified and reduced early termination fees and notice periods. 

Financial information regarding our operating segments and geographic regions is presented in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Additional financial information regarding our operating segments is presented in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 

Backlog Information 

Our contract drilling backlog reflects commitments, represented by signed drilling contracts, and was calculated by multiplying the contracted day rate by the contract period. The contracted day rate excludes certain types of lump sum fees for rig mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation, as well as customer reimbursables and bonus opportunities. Contract backlog was adjusted for drilling contracts signed or terminated after each respective balance sheet date but prior to filing each of our annual reports on Form 10-K on February 24, 2016 &#32;and March 2, 2015 , respectively. 

The following table summarizes our contract backlog of business as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#160;(in millions):

Contract drilling backlog as of December 31, 2015 for our floaters excludes $79 million &#32;in backlog attributable to contracted work for ENSCO DS-5. &#32; &#32;Petrobras has asserted that the ENSCO DS-5 drilling services contract is void. We disagree with Petrobras' assertion and plan to pursue our legal rights in connection with this dispute. See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings - DSA Dispute" for further information. &#32; 

As of December 31, 2015 , our backlog was $5.8 billion &#32;as compared to $9.7 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2014. Our floater backlog declined $2.8 billion &#32;primarily due to revenues realized during 2015, contract day rate concessions on certain rigs and ENSCO DS-4 and ENSCO DS-9 contract terminations. The remaining $1.1 billion &#32;decline primarily related to our Jackups segment and was mostly due to revenues realized during 2015 and contract day rate concessions on certain rigs, partially offset by contract extensions in the North Sea and new contracts in the Middle East.

Floater backlog for 2016 excludes $79 million &#32;attributable to the ENSCO DS-5 drilling services contract with Petrobras. Petrobras has asserted that the ENSCO DS-5 drilling services contract is void. We disagree with Petrobras' assertion and plan to pursue our legal rights in connection with this dispute. See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings - DSA Dispute" for further information. 

Our drilling contracts generally contain provisions permitting early termination of the contract (i) if the rig is lost or destroyed or (ii) by the customer if operations are suspended for a specified period of time due to breakdown of major rig equipment, unsatisfactory performance, "force majeure" events beyond the control of either party or other specified conditions. In addition, our drilling contracts generally permit early termination of the contract by the customer for convenience (without cause), exercisable upon advance notice to us, and in some cases without making an early termination payment to us. There can be no assurances that our customers will be able to or willing to fulfill their contractual commitments to us. 

The recent decline in oil prices and the perceived risk of a further decline in oil prices has caused and may continue to cause some customers to consider early termination or repudiation of contracts, despite having to pay onerous early termination fees in some cases. Customers may also request to re-negotiate the terms of existing contracts. The amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different from amounts disclosed in our backlog calculations due to a lack of predictability of various factors, including newbuild rig delivery dates, unscheduled repairs, maintenance requirements, weather delays, contract terminations or renegotiations and other factors. 

See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our current backlog of contract drilling revenue may not be fully realized and may reduce significantly in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows&#8221; and &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors - We may suffer losses if our customers terminate or seek to renegotiate our contracts, if operations are suspended or interrupted or if a rig becomes a total loss.&#8221; 

Drilling Contracts and Insurance Program 

Our drilling contracts provide for varying levels of allocation of responsibility for liability between our customer and us for loss or damage to each party's property and third party property, personal injuries and other claims arising out of our drilling operations. We also maintain insurance for personal injuries, damage to or loss of property and certain business risks. 

&#160; 

Our insurance policies typically consist of twelve-month policy periods, and the next renewal date for a substantial portion of our insurance program is scheduled for May 31, 2016. Our insurance program provides coverage, subject to the policies' terms and conditions, to the extent not otherwise assumed by the customer under the indemnification provisions of the drilling contract, for third-party claims arising from our operations, including third-party claims arising from well control events, named windstorms, sudden and accidental pollution originating from our rigs, wrongful death and personal injury. Third-party pollution claims could also arise from damage to adjacent pipelines and from spills of fluids maintained on the drilling unit. Generally, our program provides liability coverage up to $750.0 million, with a per occurrence deductible of $10.0 million or less. We retain the risk for liability not indemnified by the customer in excess of our insurance coverage. 

Well control events generally include an unintended flow from the well that cannot be contained by using equipment on site (e.g., a blowout preventer), by increasing the weight of drilling fluid or by diverting the fluids safely into production facilities. In addition to the third-party coverage described above, for claims relating to a well control event, we also have $150.0 million of coverage available to pay costs of controlling and re-drilling of the well and third-party pollution claims. 

Our insurance program also provides first party coverage to us for physical damage to, including total loss or constructive total loss of, our rigs, generally excluding damage arising from a named windstorm in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This coverage is based on an agreed amount for each rig, and has a per occurrence deductible for losses ranging from $15.0 million to $25.0 million. Due to the significant premium, high deductible and limited coverage, 

we decided not to purchase first party windstorm insurance for our jackup and floating rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Accordingly, we have retained the risk for windstorm damage to our eight &#32;jackup and nine &#32;floating rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 

Our drilling contracts customarily provide that each party is responsible for injuries or death to their respective personnel and loss or damage to their respective property (including the personnel and property of each parties&#8217; contractors and subcontractors). However, in certain drilling contracts we assume liability for damage to our customers' property and the property of other contractors of our customers resulting from our negligence, which is usually subject to negotiated caps on a per occurrence basis. In other contracts, we are not indemnified by our customers for damage to their property and the property of their other contractors. In addition, our drilling contracts typically provide for our customers to indemnify us, generally based on replacement cost minus some level of depreciation, for damage to our down-hole equipment, and in some cases for a limited amount of the replacement cost of our subsea equipment, unless the damage is caused by our negligence, normal wear and tear, or defects in the equipment. 

Subject to the exceptions noted below, our customers typically assume most of the responsibility for and indemnify us from any loss, damage or other liability resulting from pollution or contamination arising from operations, including as a result of blowouts and cratering, when the source of the pollution originates from the well or reservoir, including costs for clean-up and removal of pollution and third-party damages. In some drilling contracts, we assume liability for third-party damages resulting from such pollution and contamination caused by our negligence, usually subject to negotiated caps on a per occurrence or per event basis. In addition, in substantially all of our contracts, the customer assumes responsibility and indemnifies us for loss or damage to the reservoir, for loss of hydrocarbons escaping from the reservoir and for the costs of bringing the well under control. Further, subject to the exceptions noted below, most of our contracts provide that the customer assumes responsibility and indemnifies us for loss or damage to the well, except when the loss or damage to the well is due to our negligence, in which case most of our contracts provide that the customer's sole remedy is to require us to redrill the lost or damaged portion of the well at a substantially reduced rate. 

Most of our drilling contracts incorporate a broad exclusion that limits the operator's indemnity for damages and losses resulting from our gross negligence and willful misconduct and for fines and penalties and punitive damages levied or assessed directly against us. This exclusion overrides other provisions in the contract that limit our liability for ordinary negligence. In most of these cases we are still able to negotiate a liability cap (although these caps are significantly higher than the caps for ordinary negligence) on our exposure for losses or damages resulting from our gross negligence. In certain cases, the broad exclusion only applies to losses or damages resulting from the gross negligence of our senior supervisory personnel. However, in some cases we have contractually assumed significantly increased exposure or unlimited exposure for losses and damages due to the gross negligence of our rig personnel and in most cases we are not able to contractually limit our exposure for our willful misconduct. 

Notwithstanding our negotiation of express limitations in our drilling contracts for losses or damages resulting from our ordinary negligence and any express limitations (albeit usually much higher) for losses or damages in the event of our gross negligence, under the applicable laws that govern certain of our drilling contracts, the courts will not enforce any indemnity for losses and damages that result from our gross negligence or willful misconduct. As a result, under the laws of such jurisdictions the indemnification provisions of our drilling contracts that would otherwise limit our liability in the event of our gross negligence or willful misconduct are deemed to be void as being contrary to public policy and we will be exposed to unlimited liability for losses and damages that result from our gross negligence or willful misconduct, regardless of the express limitation of our liability in the relevant drilling contracts. Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, an indemnity from an operator for losses or damages of third parties resulting from our gross negligence is enforceable but an indemnity for losses or damages of the operator is not enforceable. In such cases, the contractual indemnity obligation of the operator to us would be enforceable with respect to third party claims for losses of damages, such as may arise in pollution claims, but the contractual indemnity obligation of the operator to us with respect to the operator&#8217;s damages to the well, to the reservoir and for the costs of well control would not be enforceable. Furthermore, although there is a lack of precedential authority for these types of claims in countries where the civil law is applied, in those situations where a codified civil law system is applicable to our drilling contracts, as opposed to the common law system, the courts generally will not enforce a contractual indemnity clause that totally 

indemnifies us from losses or damages due to our gross negligence, but generally will enforce the contractual indemnity over and above a cap on our liability for gross negligence, assuming the cap requires us to accept a significant amount of liability. 

Similar to gross negligence, regardless of any express limitations in a drilling contract regarding our liability for fines and penalties and punitive damages, the laws of most jurisdictions will not enforce an indemnity that indemnifies a party for a fine or penalty that is levied or punitive damages that are assessed directly against such party on the ground that it is against public policy to indemnify a party from a fine and penalty or punitive damages that were levied or assessed, where the purpose of such levy or assessment is to deter the behavior that resulted in the fine or penalty or punish such party for the behavior that warranted the assessment of punitive damages. 

The above description of our insurance program and the indemnification provisions of our drilling contracts is only a summary as of the date hereof and is general in nature. In addition, our drilling contracts are individually negotiated, and the degree of indemnification we receive from operators against the liabilities discussed above can vary from contract to contract, based on market conditions and customer requirements existing when the contract was negotiated and the interpretation and enforcement of applicable law when the claim is adjudicated. Notwithstanding a contractual indemnity from a customer, there can be no assurance that our customers will be financially able to indemnify us or will otherwise honor a contractual indemnity obligation that is enforceable under applicable law. Our insurance program and the terms of our drilling contracts may change in the future. 

In certain cases, vendors who provide equipment or services to us limit their pollution liability to a specific monetary cap, and we assume the liability above that cap. Typically, in the case of original equipment manufacturers, the cap is a negotiated amount based on mutual agreement of the parties considering the risk profiles and thresholds of each party. However, for smaller vendors, the liability is usually limited to the value, or double the value, of the contract. 

We generally indemnify the customer for legal and financial consequences of spills of waste oil, fuels, lubricants, motor oils, pipe dope, paint, solvents, ballast, bilge, garbage, debris, sewage, hazardous waste and other liquids, the discharge of which originates from our rigs or equipment above the surface of the water and in some cases from our subsea equipment. Our contracts generally provide that, in the event of any such spill from our rigs, we are responsible for fines and penalties. 

Major Customers 

We provide our contract drilling services to major international, government-owned and independent oil and gas companies. During 2015 , our five largest customers accounted for 52% &#32;of consolidated revenues. BP and Petrobras, our largest customers, accounted for 18% &#32;and 14% &#32;of consolidated revenues, respectively. 

Competition 

The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive. Drilling contracts are, for the most part, awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price competition is often the primary factor in determining which contractor is awarded a contract, although quality of service, operational and safety performance, equipment suitability and availability, location of equipment, reputation and technical expertise also are factors. We have numerous competitors in the offshore contract drilling industry with significant resources. 

Governmental Regulation 

Our operations are affected by political developments and by laws and regulations that relate directly to the oil and gas industry, including laws and regulations that have or may impose increased financial responsibility and oil spill abatement contingency plan capability requirements. Accordingly, we will be directly affected by the approval and adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and natural gas for economic, environmental, safety or other policy reasons. It is also possible that these laws and regulations could adversely affect our operations in the future by significantly increasing our operating costs. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors- Increasing regulatory complexity could adversely impact the costs associated with our offshore drilling operations." 

Environmental Matters 

Our operations are subject to laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, pollution, contamination and hazardous waste disposal or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Environmental laws and regulations specifically applicable to our business activities could impose significant liability on us for damages, clean-up costs, fines and penalties in the event of oil spills or similar discharges of pollutants or contaminants into the environment or improper disposal of hazardous waste generated in the course of our operations, which may not be covered by contractual indemnification or insurance and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows. To date, such laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results, and we have not experienced an accident that has exposed us to material liability arising out of or relating to discharges of pollutants into the environment. However, the legislative, judicial and regulatory response to any well incidents could substantially increase our customers' liabilities in respect of oil spills and also could increase our liabilities. In addition to potential increased liabilities, such legislative, judicial or regulatory action could impose increased financial, insurance or other requirements that may adversely impact the entire offshore drilling industry. 

The International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation, the U.K. Merchant Shipping Act 1995, Marpol 73/78, the U.K. Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation Convention) Regulations 1998 and other related legislation and regulations and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA 90"), as amended, The Clean Water Act, and other U.S. federal statutes applicable to us and our operations, as well as similar statutes in Texas, Louisiana, other coastal states and other non-U.S. jurisdictions, address oil spill prevention, reporting and control and significantly expand liability, fine and penalty exposure across many segments of the oil and gas industry. Such statutes and related regulations impose a variety of obligations on us related to the prevention of oil spills, disposal of waste and liability for resulting damages. For instance, OPA 90 imposes strict and, with limited exceptions, joint and several liability upon each responsible party for oil removal costs as well as a variety of fines, penalties and damages. Similar environmental laws apply in our other areas of operation. Failure to comply with these statutes and regulations, including OPA 90, may subject us to civil or criminal enforcement action, which may not be covered by contractual indemnification or insurance and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows. 

Events in recent years, including the Macondo well incident, have heightened governmental and environmental concerns about the oil and gas industry. From time to time, legislative proposals have been introduced that would materially limit or prohibit offshore drilling in certain areas. We are adversely affected by restrictions on drilling in certain areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere, including the adoption of additional safety requirements and policies regarding the approval of drilling permits, restrictions on development and production activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico that have and may further impact our operations. 

As a result of Macondo, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement ("BSEE") issued a drilling safety rule in 2012 that included requirements for the cementing of wells, well control barriers, blowout preventers, well-control fluids, well completions, workovers and de-commissioning operations. BSEE has also issued regulations requiring operators to have safety and environmental management systems ("SEMS") prior to conducting operations. In addition, in August 2012, BSEE issued Interim Policy Document stating that it would begin issuing Incidents of Non-Compliance ("INC's") to operators for serious violations of BSEE regulations. Although we have not yet incurred 

any material exposure from such regulations/decisions, the issuance of INC's could potentially make it easier for a successful assertion of third party claims against us. 

&#32;Since 2014, the United States Coast Guard ("USCG") has proposed new regulations that would impose GPS equipment and positioning requirements for mobile offshore drilling units and jackup rigs operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and issued notices regarding the development of regulations for cybersecurity measures used in the marine and offshore energy sectors for all vessels and facilities that are subject to the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, including our rigs. In April 2015, BSEE proposed new rules that, if and when enacted, would include more stringent design requirements for well control equipment used in offshore drilling operations. Based on our assessment of the proposed rules, we may incur significant costs to comply with the rules if they are adopted as proposed. We are continuing to evaluate the cost and effect that these proposed new rules will have on our operations. If new laws are enacted or other government actions are taken that restrict or prohibit offshore drilling in our principal areas of operation or impose environmental protection requirements that materially increase the liabilities, financial requirements or operating or equipment costs associated with offshore drilling, exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas, our financial position, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Compliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly and could limit our operations." 

Non-U.S. Operations 

Revenues from non-U.S. operations were 72% , 62% &#32;and 61% &#32;of our total consolidated revenues during 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Our non-U.S. operations and shipyard rig construction and enhancement projects are subject to political, economic and other uncertainties, including:
