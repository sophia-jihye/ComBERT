Overview 

&#160; 

We are a publicly traded limited partnership with a diverse set of operations focused primarily in the United States ("U.S.") Gulf Coast region. Our four primary business lines include: 

&#8226; 

Terminalling and storage services for petroleum products and by-products, including the refining of naphthenic crude oil and the blending and packaging of finished lubricants; 

&#8226; 

Natural gas liquids transportation and distribution services and natural gas storage; 

&#8226; 

Sulfur and sulfur-based products gathering, processing, marketing, manufacturing and distribution; and 

&#8226; 

Marine transportation services for petroleum products and by-products. 

The petroleum products and by-products we collect, transport, store and market are produced primarily by major and independent oil and gas companies who often turn to third parties, such as us, for the transportation and disposition of these products. In addition to these major and independent oil and gas companies, our primary customers include independent refiners, large chemical companies, fertilizer manufacturers and other wholesale purchasers of these products. We operate primarily in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. This region is a major hub for petroleum refining, natural gas gathering and processing, and support services for the exploration and production industry. 

We were formed in 2002 by Martin Resource Management, a privately-held company whose initial predecessor was incorporated in 1951 as a supplier of products and services to drilling rig contractors. Since then, Martin Resource Management has expanded its operations through acquisitions and internal expansion initiatives as its management identified 

and capitalized on the needs of producers and purchasers of petroleum products and by-products and other bulk liquids. Martin Resource Management is an important supplier and customer of ours. As of December 31, 2015, Martin Resource Management owned 17.7% of our total outstanding common limited partner units. Furthermore, Martin Resource Management controls Martin Midstream GP LLC ("MMGP"), our general partner, by virtue of its 51% voting interest in MMGP Holdings, LLC ("Holdings"), the sole member of MMGP. MMGP owns a 2.0% general partner interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights. Martin Resource Management directs our business operations through its ownership interests in and control of our general partner. 

We entered into an omnibus agreement dated November 1, 2002, with Martin Resource Management (the "Omnibus Agreement") that governs, among other things, potential competition and indemnification obligations among the parties to the agreement, related party transactions, the provision of general administration and support services by Martin Resource Management and our use of certain of Martin Resource Management&#8217;s trade names and trademarks. Under the terms of the Omnibus Agreement, the employees of Martin Resource Management are responsible for conducting our business and operating our assets. The Omnibus Agreement was amended on November 25, 2009, to include processing crude oil into finished products including naphthenic lubricants, distillates, asphalt and other intermediate cuts. The Omnibus Agreement was amended further on October 1, 2012, to permit the Partnership to provide certain lubricant packaging products and services to Martin Resource Management. 

Martin Resource Management has operated our business since 2002. Martin Resource Management began operating our natural gas services business in the 1950s and our sulfur business in the 1960s. It began our marine transportation business in the late 1980s. It entered into our fertilizer and terminalling and storage businesses in the early 1990s. In recent years, Martin Resource Management has increased the size of our asset base through expansions and strategic acquisitions. 

Primary Business Segments 

&#160; 

Our primary business segments can be generally described as follows: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Terminalling and Storage. We own or operate 29 marine shore-based terminal facilities and 16 specialty terminal facilities located primarily in the U.S. Gulf Coast region that provide storage, refining, blending, packaging, and handling services for producers and suppliers of petroleum products and by-products, including the refining of naphthenic crude oil and the blending and packaging of various grades and quantities of industrial, commercial, and automotive lubricants and greases. Our facilities and resources provide us with the ability to handle various products that require specialized treatment, such as molten sulfur and asphalt. We also provide land rental to oil and gas companies along with storage and handling services for lubricants and fuels. We provide these terminalling and storage services on a fee basis primarily under long-term contracts. A significant portion of the contracts in this segment provide for minimum fee arrangements that are not based on the volumes handled. 

&#8226; 

Natural Gas Services. We distribute natural gas liquids ("NGLs"). We purchase NGLs primarily from refineries and natural gas processors. We store and transport NGLs for wholesale deliveries to refineries, industrial NGL users in Texas and the Southeastern U.S, and propane retailers. We own a NGL pipeline, which spans approximately 200 miles from Kilgore, Texas to Beaumont, Texas. We own approximately 2.4 million barrels of underground storage capacity for NGLs. Additionally, we own 100% of the interests in Cardinal Gas Storage Partners LLC ("Cardinal"), which is focused on the development, construction, operation and management of natural gas storage facilities across northern Louisiana and Mississippi. We own a combined 20% interest in West Texas LPG Pipeline L.P. ("WTLPG"). WTLPG is operated by ONEOK Partners, L.P. ("ONEOK"), which owns the remaining 80.0% interest. WTLPG owns an approximate 2,300 mile common-carrier pipeline system that transports NGLs from New Mexico and Texas to Mont Belvieu, Texas for fractionation. This asset enables us to participate in the transportation of NGL production in West Texas and other basins along the WTLPG pipeline route. We owned six liquefied petroleum gas ("LPG") pressure barges, (collectively referred to as the "Floating Storage Assets"). These assets were primarily operated under the floating storage component of our NGL distribution business. On February 12, 2015, we sold the Floating Storage Assets for $41.3 million. 

&#8226; 

Sulfur Services. We have developed an integrated system of transportation assets and facilities relating to sulfur services. We process and distribute sulfur produced by oil refineries primarily located in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. We buy and sell molten sulfur on contracts that are tied to sulfur indices and tend to provide stable margins. We process molten sulfur into prilled or pelletized sulfur at our facilities in Port of Stockton, California and Beaumont, Texas on contracts that often provide guaranteed minimum fees. The sulfur we process and handle is primarily used in the production of fertilizers and industrial chemicals. We own and operate six sulfur-based fertilizer production plants and one emulsified sulfur blending plant that manufactures primarily sulfur- 

based fertilizer products for wholesale distributors and industrial users. These plants are located in Texas, Illinois, and Utah. Demand for our sulfur products exists in both the domestic and foreign markets, and we believe our asset base provides us with additional opportunities to handle increases in U.S. supply and access to foreign demand. 

&#8226; 

Marine Transportation. We operate a fleet of 45 inland marine tank barges, 25 inland push boats and three offshore tug and barge units that transport petroleum products and by-products largely in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. We provide these transportation services on a fee basis primarily under annual contracts, and many of our customers have long standing contractual relationships with us. Our modernized asset base is attractive both to our existing customers as well as potential new customers. In addition, our fleet contains several vessels that reflect our focus on specialty products. 

Recent Developments 

Commodity prices have declined substantially and experienced significant volatility. If commodity prices remain weak for a sustained period, our pipeline, terminalling throughput and NGL volumes may be negatively impacted, particularly as producers are curtailing or redirecting drilling. A sustained decline in commodity prices could result in a decrease in activity in the areas served by certain of our terminalling and storage and marine transportation assets resulting in reduced utilization of these assets. Drilling activity levels vary by geographic area, but in general, we have observed widespread decreases in drilling activity, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, with lower commodity prices. We continually adjust our business strategy to focus on maximizing liquidity; maintaining a stable asset base, which generates fee based revenues not sensitive to commodity prices; and improving profitability by increasing asset utilization and controlling costs, which includes force reductions and asset rationalization strategies. Given the current environment, we have altered and reduced our planned growth capital expenditures. We believe that controlling our spending in an effort to preserve liquidity is prudent and reduces our need for near-term access to the somewhat uncertain capital markets. 

&#160; 

The following information highlights selected developments since January 1, 2015. 

Reduction of Commitments Under Revolving Credit Facility. On August 14, 2015, we notified the Royal Bank of Canada, the administrative agent of our revolving credit facility, that we were reducing the aggregate committed sum (as defined in the underlying credit agreement) from $900.0 million to $700.0 million. We have the ability to exercise the accordion feature of our revolving credit facility at any time and expand the facility up to an aggregate committed sum of $1.0 billion. As a result of the decreased capacity, we expect to reduce the amount of commitment fees under our revolving credit facility by approximately $1.0 million on an annual basis. 

Disposition of Floating Storage Assets. On February 12, 2015, we sold the Floating Storage Assets for $41.3 million. These assets were primarily operated under the floating storage component of our NGL distribution business. The proceeds from the disposition were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility. &#160; 

Subsequent Events 

Quarterly Distribution. On January 21, 2016, we declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.8125 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2015, or $3.25 per common unit on an annualized basis, which was paid on February 12, 2016 to unitholders of record as of February 5, 2016. Additionally, we paid a distribution to our general partner in the amount of $4.6 million. Of this amount, $0.7 million is related to the base general partner distribution and $3.9 million represents incentive distribution rights paid to our general partner. 

Our Growth Strategy 

The key components of our growth strategy are: 

&#8226; 

Pursue Organic Growth Projects . We continually evaluate economically attractive organic expansion opportunities in new or existing areas of operation that will allow us to leverage our existing market position and increase the distributable cash flow from our existing assets through improved utilization and efficiency. 

&#8226; 

Pursue Internal Organic Growth by Attracting New Customers and Expanding Services Provided to Existing Customers . Significant opportunities exist to expand our customer base across all four of our business segments and provide additional services and products to existing customers. We generally begin a relationship with a customer by transporting, storing or marketing a limited range of products and services. Expanding our customer 

base and our service and product offerings to existing customers is an efficient and cost effective method of achieving organic growth in revenues and cash flow. 

&#8226; 

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions . We continually monitor the marketplace to identify and pursue accretive acquisitions that expand the services and products we offer or that expand our geographic presence. After acquiring other businesses, we attempt to utilize our industry knowledge, network of customers and suppliers and strategic asset base to operate the acquired businesses more efficiently and competitively, thereby increasing revenues and cash flow. Our diversified base of operations provides multiple platforms for strategic growth through acquisitions. 

&#8226; 

Pursue Strategic Commercial Alliances . Many of our larger customers, which include major integrated energy companies, have established strategic alliances with midstream service providers such as us to address logistical and transportation problems or achieve operational synergies. We intend to pursue strategic commercial alliances with such customers in the future. 

Competitive Strengths 

As discussed previously, commodity prices have declined substantially and experienced significant volatility. We plan for these cyclical downturns in commodity prices and we believe we are positioned to withstand the effect on our assets with respect to current and future commodity price volatility as a result of the following information. 

Fee Based Contracts . &#32;&#32;We generate a majority of our cash flow from fee-based contracts with our customers. A significant portion of the fee-based contracts consist of reservation charges or minimum fee arrangements, which reduce the volatility of our cash flows due to volume fluctuations. 

Asset Base and Integrated Distribution Network . &#32;We operate a diversified asset base that enables us to offer our customers an integrated distribution network consisting of transportation, terminalling and storage and midstream logistical services while minimizing our dependence on the availability and pricing of services provided by third parties. Our integrated distribution network enables us to provide customers with a complementary portfolio of transportation, terminalling, distribution and other midstream services for petroleum products and by-products. 

Strategically Located Assets . &#32;&#32;A significant portion of our cash flow comes from providing various services to the oil refining industry. Accordingly, a significant portion of our assets are located in proximity to refining operations along the U.S. Gulf Coast. For example,we are one of the largest operators of marine service shore-based terminals in the U.S. Gulf Coast region providing broad geographic coverage and distribution capability of our products and services to our customers. Our natural gas storage and NGL distribution and storage assets are located in areas highly desirable for our customers. Finally, many of our sulfur services assets are strategically located to source sulfur from the largest refinery sources in the U.S. 

Specialized Transportation Equipment and Storage Facilities . &#32;We have the assets and expertise to handle and transport certain petroleum products and by-products with unique requirements for transportation and storage. For example, we own facilities and resources to transport a variety of specialty products, including ammonia, molten sulfur and asphalt. Some of these specialty products require treatment across a wide range of temperatures ranging between approximately -30 to +400 degrees Fahrenheit to remain in liquid form, which our facilities are designed to accommodate. These capabilities help us enhance relationships with our customers by offering them services to handle their unique product requirements. 

Strong Industry Reputation and Established Relationships with Suppliers and Customers . &#32;We have established a reputation in our industry as a reliable and cost-effective supplier of services to our customers and have a track record of safe, efficient operation of our facilities. Our management has also established long-term relationships with many of our suppliers and customers. We benefit from our management's reputation and track record and from these long-term relationships. 

Experienced Management Team and Operational Expertise . Members of our executive management team and the heads of our principal business lines have a significant amount of experience in the industries in which we operate. Our management team has a successful track record of creating internal growth and completing acquisitions. Our management team's experience and familiarity with our industry and businesses are important assets that assist us in implementing our business strategies. 

Terminalling and Storage Segment 

&#160; 

Industry Overview. The U.S. petroleum distribution system moves petroleum products and by-products from oil refineries and natural gas processing facilities to end users. This distribution system is comprised of a network of terminals, storage facilities, pipelines, tankers, barges, railcars and trucks. Terminals play a key role in moving these products throughout the distribution system by providing storage, blending and other ancillary services. 

&#160; 

Although many large energy and chemical companies own terminalling and storage facilities, these companies also use third-party terminalling and storage services. Major energy and chemical companies typically have a strong demand for terminals owned by independent operators when such terminals are strategically located at or near key transportation links, such as deep-water ports. Major energy and chemical companies also need independent terminal storage when their owned storage facilities are inadequate, either because of lack of capacity, the nature of the stored material or specialized handling requirements. 

The Gulf Coast region is a major hub for petroleum refining. Approximately 50% of U.S. refining capacity exists in this region. Growth in the refining and natural gas processing industries has increased the volume of petroleum products and by-products that are transported within the Gulf Coast region, which consequently has increased the need for terminalling and storage services. 

&#160; 

The marine and offshore oil and gas exploration and production industries use terminal facilities in the Gulf Coast region as shore bases that provide them logistical support services as well as provide a broad range of products, including fuel oil, lubricants, chemicals and supplies. The demand for these types of terminals, services and products is driven primarily by offshore exploration, development and production in the Gulf of Mexico. Offshore activity is greatly influenced by current and projected prices of oil and natural gas. 

&#160; 

Specialty Petroleum Terminals. We own or operate 16 terminalling facilities providing storage, handling and transportation of various petroleum products and by-products. The locations and capabilities of our terminals are structured to complement our other businesses and reflect our strategy to provide a broad range of integrated services in the storage, handling and transportation of products. We developed our terminalling and storage assets by acquisition and upgrades of existing facilities as well as developing our own properties strategically located near rail, waterways and pipelines. We anticipate further expansion of our terminalling facilities through both acquisition and organic growth. 

The Tampa terminal is located on approximately 10 acres of land owned by the Tampa Port Authority that was leased to us under a 10-year lease that commenced on December 16, 2006. This lease may be extended at the option of the tenant for two consecutive extension option periods of five years. The Stanolind terminal is located on approximately 11 acres of land owned by us located on the Neches River in Beaumont, Texas. The Neches terminal is a deep water marine terminal located near Beaumont, Texas, on approximately 50 acres of land owned by us, and an additional 96 acres leased to us under terms of a 20-year lease commencing May 1, 2014 with three five-year options. The Corpus Christi, Texas barge terminal is located on approximately 15 acres of land owned by us and has access to the waterfront via marine docks owned by the Port of Corpus Christi. The Corpus Christi, Texas crude terminal is located on 10 acres leased from the Port of Corpus Christi under terms of a five-year lease commencing on May 19, 2011 with five five-year extension options. 

At the Tampa, Neches, Stanolind and Corpus Christi terminals, our customers are primarily large oil refining companies. We charge either a fixed monthly fee or a throughput fee for the use of our facilities based on the capacity of the applicable tank. We conduct a substantial portion of our terminalling and storage operations under long-term contracts, which enhances the stability and predictability of our operations and cash flow. We attempt to balance our short-term and long-term terminalling contracts in order to allow us to maintain a consistent level of cash flow while maintaining flexibility to earn higher storage revenues when demand for storage space increases. In addition, a significant portion of the contracts for our specialty terminals provide for minimum fee arrangements that are not based on the volume handled. 

In Houston, Texas, we operate a terminal used for lubricant blending, storage, packaging and distribution. This terminal is used as our central hub for bulk lubricant distribution where we receive, package and ship lubricants to our terminals or directly to customers. 

In Smackover, Arkansas, we own a refinery and terminal where we process crude oil into finished products that include naphthenic lubricants, distillates, asphalt and other intermediates. This process is dedicated to an affiliate of Martin Resource Management through a long-term tolling agreement based on throughput rates and a monthly reservation fee. 

In Smackover, Arkansas, we own and operate a terminal used for lubricant blending, processing, packaging, marketing and distribution. This terminal is used as our central hub for branded and private label packaged lubricants where we receive, package and ship heavy-duty, passenger car, and industrial lubricants to a network of retailers and distributors. 

In Kansas City, Missouri, we lease and operate a plant that specializes in the processing and packaging of automotive, commercial and industrial greases. 

In South Houston, Texas, we own an asphalt terminal whose use is dedicated to an affiliate of Martin Resource Management through a terminalling service agreement based on throughput rates. 

In Port Neches, Texas, we own an asphalt terminal whose use is dedicated to an affiliate of Martin Resource Management through a terminalling service agreement based upon throughput rates.

In Elko, Nevada, we lease and operate a sulfuric acid terminal whose use is dedicated to an affiliate of Martin Resource Management through a terminalling service agreement based on throughput rates. 

In Beaumont, Texas we own a terminal where we receive natural gasoline via pipeline and then ship the product to our customers via other pipelines to which the facility is connected, referred to as the "Spindletop Terminal." Our fees for the use of this facility are based on the volume of barrels shipped from the terminal. 

In Jennings, Louisiana, we own a lubricant terminal whose use is dedicated to an affiliate of Martin Resource Management through a terminalling service agreement based on throughput rates. 

In Lake Charles, Louisiana, we lease and operate a lubricant terminal whose use is dedicated to an affiliate of Martin Resource Management through a terminalling service agreement based on throughput rates.

Marine Shore-Based Terminals. We own or operate 29 marine shore-based terminals along the Gulf Coast from Theodore, Alabama to Corpus Christi, Texas. Our terminalling assets are located at strategic distribution points for the products we handle and are in close proximity to our customers. We are one of the largest operators of marine shore-based terminals in the Gulf Coast region. These terminals are used to distribute and market fuel and lubricants. Additionally, full service terminals also provide shore bases for companies that are operating in the offshore exploration and production industry. Customers are primarily oil and gas exploration and production companies and oilfield service companies, such as drilling fluid companies, marine transportation companies and offshore construction companies. Shore bases typically provide logistical support, including the storing and handling of tubular goods, loading and unloading bulk materials, providing facilities from which major and independent oil companies can communicate with and control offshore operations and leasing dockside facilities to companies which provide complementary products and services such as drilling fluids and cementing services. We generate revenues from our terminals that have shore bases by fees that we charge our customers under land rental contracts for the use of our terminal facility for these shore bases. These contracts generally provide us a fixed land rental fee and additional rental fees that are determined based on a percentage of the sales value of the products and services delivered from the shore base. In addition, Martin Resource Management, through terminalling service agreements, pays us for terminalling and storage of fuels and lubricants at these terminal facilities and includes a provision for minimum volume throughput requirements. 

&#160; 

Our marine shore-based terminals are divided into two classes of terminals: (i) full service terminals and (ii) fuel and lubricant terminals. 

&#160; 

Full Service Terminals. We own or operate 10 full service terminals. These facilities provide logistical support services and storage and handling services for fuel and lubricants. The significant difference between our full service terminals and our fuel and lubricant terminals is that our full service terminals generate additional revenues by providing shore bases to support our customer&#8217;s operating activities related to the offshore exploration and production industry. One typical use for our shore bases is for drilling fluids manufacturers to manufacture and sell drilling fluids to the offshore drilling industry. Offshore drilling companies may also set up service facilities at these terminals to support their offshore operations. Customers of our full service terminals are primarily oil and gas exploration and production companies, oilfield service companies such as drilling fluids companies, marine transportation companies and offshore construction companies.

&#160; 

Competition. We compete with independent terminal operators and major energy and chemical companies that own their own terminalling and storage facilities. Many customers prefer to contract with independent terminal operators rather than terminal operators owned by integrated energy and chemical companies that may have refining or marketing interests that compete with the customers. 

Independent terminal owners generally compete on the basis of the location and versatility of terminals, service and price. A favorably-located terminal has access to various cost effective transportation modes, both to and from the terminal, such as waterways, railroads, roadways and pipelines. Terminal versatility depends upon the operator&#8217;s ability to handle diverse products, some of which have complex or specialized handling and storage requirements. The service function of a terminal includes, among other things, the safe storage of product at specified temperature, moisture and other conditions and receiving and delivering product to and from the terminal. All of these services must be in compliance with applicable environmental and other regulations. 

We successfully compete for terminal customers because of the strategic location of our terminals along the Gulf Coast, our integrated transportation services, our reputation, the prices we charge for our services and the quality and versatility of our services. Additionally, while some companies have significantly more terminalling and storage capacity than us, not all terminalling and storage facilities located in the markets we serve are equipped to properly handle specialty products such as asphalt, sulfur and anhydrous ammonia. 

The principal competitive factors affecting our terminals, which provide fuel and lubricants distribution and marketing, as well as shore bases at certain terminals, are the locations of the facilities, availability of competing logistical support services and the experience of personnel and dependability of service. The distribution and marketing of our lubricant products is brand sensitive and we encounter brand loyalty competition. Shore base rental contracts are generally long-term contracts and provide more protection from competition. Our primary competitors for both lubricants and shore bases include several independent operations as well as major companies that maintain their own similarly equipped marine terminals, shore bases and fuel and lubricant supply sources. 

&#32;Natural Gas Services Segment 

&#160; 

Industry Overview. NGLs are produced through natural gas processing and as a by-product of crude oil refining. NGLs include ethane, propane, normal butane, iso butane and natural gasoline. 

Ethane is almost entirely used as a petrochemical feedstock in the production of ethylene and propylene. Propane is used as a petrochemical feedstock in the production of ethylene and propylene, as a fuel for heating, for industrial applications, as motor fuel and as a refrigerant. Normal butane is used as a petrochemical feedstock, as a blend stock for motor gasoline and as a component in aerosol propellants. Normal butane can also be made into iso butane through isomerization. Iso butane is used in the production of motor gasoline, alkylation and as a component in aerosol propellants. Natural gasoline is used as a component of motor gasoline, as a petrochemical feedstock and as a diluent. 

Facilities. We purchase NGLs primarily from major domestic oil refiners and natural gas processors. We transport NGLs using Martin Resource Management&#8217;s land transportation fleet or by contracting with common carriers, owner-operators and railroad tank cars. We typically enter into annual contracts with independent retail propane distributors to deliver their estimated annual volume requirements based on prevailing market prices. Dependable delivery is very important to these customers and in some cases may be more important than price. We ensure adequate supply of NGLs through: 

&#8226; 

storage of NGLs purchased in off-peak months; 

&#8226; 

efficient use of railroad tank cars and the transportation fleet of vehicles owned by Martin Resource Management; and 

&#8226; 

product management expertise to obtain supplies when needed.

We lease our underground storage at Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, from third parties under one-year lease agreements. 

Our NGL customers consist of refiners, industrial processors and retail propane distributors. The majority of our NGL volumes are sold to refiners and industrial processors. 

&#160; 

We generally maintain consistent margins in our natural gas services business because we attempt to pass increases and decreases in the cost of NGLs directly to our customers. We generally try to coordinate our sales and purchases of NGLs based on the same daily price index of NGLs in order to decrease the impact of NGL price volatility on our profitability. 

Natural Gas Storage. &#32;&#32;Natural gas storage facilities provide a staging and warehousing function for seasonal swings in demand relative to supply, as well as an essential reliability cushion against disruptions in natural gas supply, demand and transportation by allowing natural gas to be injected into, withdrawn from or warehoused in such storage facilities as dictated by market conditions. The long term demand for storage services in the U.S. is driven primarily by the long-term demand for natural gas and the overall lack of balance between the supply of and demand for natural gas on a seasonal, monthly, daily or other basis. In general and on a long-term basis, to the extent the overall demand for natural gas increases and such growth includes higher demand from seasonal or weather-sensitive end-users (such as gas-fired power generators and residential and commercial consumers), demand for natural gas storage services should also grow. In addition, any factors that contribute to more frequent and severe imbalances between the supply of and demand for natural gas, whether caused by supply or demand fluctuations, should increase the need for and the value of storage services. On a short term basis, storage demand and values are also significantly influenced by operational imbalances, near term seasonal spreads, shorter term spreads and basis differentials. 

We own 100% of the interests in Cardinal, which is focused on the operation, management, development, and construction of natural gas storage facilities across northern Louisiana and Mississippi.

These facilities were developed to provide producers, end users, local distribution companies, pipelines and energy marketers with high-deliverability storage services and hub services. 

NGL Marine Storage. We owned six LPG pressure barges, which we acquired in February 2013. These assets were primarily operated under the floating storage component of our NGL distribution business. On February 12, 2015, we sold the barges for $41.3 million. 

LPG Pipeline Investment . On May 14, 2014, we acquired a combined 20% interest in WTLPG. WTLPG owns an approximate 2,300 mile common-carrier pipeline system that transports NGLs from New Mexico and Texas to Mont Belvieu, Texas for fractionation. This acquisition will enable the Partnership to participate in the transportation of NGL production in West Texas and other basins along the WTLPG pipeline route. 

Competition. We compete with large integrated NGL producers and marketers, as well as small local independent marketers. The primary components of competition related to our natural gas storage operations are location, rates, terms and flexibility of service and supply. Our natural gas storage facilities compete with other storage providers and increased competition could result form newly developed storage facilities or expanded capacity from existing competitors. 

&#160; 

Seasonality. The level of NGL supply and demand is subject to changes in domestic production, weather, inventory levels and other factors. While production is not seasonal, residential, refinery, and wholesale demand is highly seasonal. This imbalance causes increases in inventories during summer months when consumption is low and decreases in inventories during winter months when consumption is high. If inventories are low at the start of the winter, higher prices are more likely to occur during the winter. Additionally, abnormally cold weather can put extra upward pressure on propane prices during the winter because there are less readily available sources of additional supply except for imports, which are less accessible and may take several weeks to arrive. General economic conditions and inventory levels have a greater impact on industrial and refinery use of NGLs than the weather. 

Sulfur Services Segment 

&#160; 

Industry Overview. Sulfur is a natural element and is required to produce a variety of industrial products. In the U.S., approximately 10 million tons of sulfur are consumed annually with the Tampa, Florida area being the largest single market. Currently, all sulfur produced in the U.S. is "recovered sulfur," or sulfur that is a by-product from oil refineries and natural gas processing plants. Sulfur production in the U.S. is principally located along the Gulf Coast, along major inland waterways and in some areas of the western U.S. 

&#160; 

Sulfur is an important plant nutrient and is primarily used in the manufacture of phosphate fertilizers and other industrial purposes. The primary application of sulfur in fertilizers occurs in the form of sulfuric acid. Burning sulfur creates sulfur dioxide, which is subsequently oxidized and dissolved in water to create sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid is then combined with phosphate rock to make phosphoric acid, the base material for most high-grade phosphate fertilizers. 

&#160; 

Sulfur-based fertilizers are manufactured chemicals containing nutrients known to improve the fertility of soils. Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulfur are the four most important nutrients for crop growth. These nutrients are found naturally in soils. However, soils used for agriculture become depleted of nutrients and require fertilizers rich in nutrients to restore fertility. 

&#160; 

Industrial sulfur products (including sulfuric acid) are used in a wide variety of industries. For example, these products are used in power plants, paper mills, auto and tire manufacturing plants, food processing plants, road construction, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. 

&#160; 

Our Operations and Products. We maintain an integrated system of transportation assets and facilities relating to our sulfur services. We gather molten sulfur from refiners, primarily located on the Gulf Coast. We transport sulfur by inland and offshore barges, railcars and trucks. In the U.S., recovered sulfur is mainly kept in liquid form from production to usage at a temperature of approximately 275 degrees Fahrenheit. Because of the temperature requirement, the sulfur industry uses specialized equipment to store and transport molten sulfur. We have the necessary assets and expertise to handle the unique requirements for transportation and storage of molten sulfur. 

&#160; 

The terms of our commercial sulfur contracts typically range from one to five years in length. We handle molten sulfur on cost-plus contracts and margin-based contracts, and the prices in such contracts are usually tied to a published market indicator and fluctuate according to the price movement of the indicator. We also provide barge transportation and tank storage services to large integrated oil companies that produce sulfur and fertilizer manufacturers that consume sulfur under transportation and storage contracts with remaining terms from one to two years in duration. 

&#160; 

The sulfur assets located at the Port of Stockton in California are used to process (prill) molten sulfur into pellets. The Stockton facility can process approximately 1,000 metric tons of molten sulfur per day and the resulting dry pellets are stored in bulk until sold into certain U.S. and international agricultural markets. Our two Beaumont prillers along with our granulator have the capacity to process approximately 5,500 metric tons of molten sulfur per day. We process molten sulfur into formed sulfur on take-or-pay fee contracts, providing refiners access to the export market for the sale of their residual sulfur. 

&#160; 

Our sulfuric acid production facility at our Plainview, Texas location processes molten sulfur to produce approximately 150,000 tons of sulfuric acid per year. This acid production provides a dedicated supply of raw material sulfuric acid to our ammonium sulfate production plant. The ammonium sulfate plant produces approximately 400 tons per day of quality ammonium sulfate and is marketed to our customers throughout the U.S. The sulfuric acid produced and not consumed by the captive ammonium sulfate production is sold to Martin Resource Management, which markets the excess production to third parties. 

Fertilizer and related sulfur products are a natural extension of our molten sulfur business because of our access to sulfur and our distribution capabilities. These products allow us to leverage the Sulfur Services segment of our business. Our annual fertilizer and industrial sulfur products sales have grown significantly as a result of acquisitions and internal growth. 

&#160; 

In the U.S., fertilizer is generally sold to farmers through local dealers. These dealers are typically owned and supplied by much larger wholesale distributors. We sell to these wholesale distributors. Our industrial sulfur products are marketed primarily in the southern U.S., where many paper manufacturers and power plants are located. Our products are sold in accordance with price lists that vary from state to state. These price lists are updated periodically to reflect changes in seasonal or competitive prices. We transport our fertilizer and industrial sulfur products to our customers using third-party common carriers. We utilize rail shipments for large volume and long distance shipments where available. 

&#160; 

We manufacture and market the following sulfur-based fertilizer and related sulfur products: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Plant nutrient sulfur products. We produce plant nutrient and agricultural ground sulfur products at our facilities in Odessa, Texas, Seneca, Illinois and Cactus, Texas. Our plant nutrient sulfur product is a 90% degradable sulfur product marketed under the Disper-Sul&#174; trade name and sold throughout the U.S. to direct application agricultural markets. Our agricultural ground sulfur products are used primarily in the western U.S. on grapes and vegetable crops. 

&#8226; 

Ammonium sulfate products. We produce various grades of ammonium sulfate including granular, coarse, standard, and 40% ammonium sulfate solution. These products primarily serve direct application agricultural markets. We blend our ammonium sulfate to make custom grades of lawn and garden fertilizer at our facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. We package these custom grade products under both proprietary and private labels and sell them to major retail distributors and other retail customers. 

&#8226; 

Industrial sulfur products. We produce industrial sulfur products such as elemental pastille sulfur, industrial ground sulfur products, and emulsified sulfur. We produce elemental pastille sulfur at our Odessa, Texas and Seneca, Illinois facilities. Elemental pastille sulfur is used to increase the efficiency of the coal-fired precipitators in the power industry. These industrial ground sulfur products are also used in a variety of dusting and wettable sulfur applications such as rubber manufacturing, fungicides, sugar and animal feeds. We produce emulsified sulfur at our Nash, Texas facility. Emulsified sulfur is primarily used to control the sulfur content in the pulp and paper manufacturing processes. 

&#8226; 

Liquid sulfur products. We produce ammonium thiosulfate at our Neches terminal facility in Beaumont, Texas. This agricultural sulfur product is a clear liquid containing 12% nitrogen and 26% sulfur. This product serves as a liquid plant nutrient used directly through spray rigs or irrigation systems. It is also blended with other nitrogen phosphorus potassium liquids or suspensions as well. Our market is predominantly the Mid-South U.S. and Coastal Bend area of Texas.

Competition. We own one of the four vessels currently used to transport molten sulfur between U.S. ports on the Gulf of Mexico and Tampa, Florida. Phosphate fertilizer manufacturers consume a vast majority of the sulfur produced in the U.S., which they purchase from resellers as well as directly from producers. We compete primarily with U.S. producers that sell directly to consumers with access to transportation and storage assets as well as foreign suppliers from Mexico or Venezuela that may sell into the Florida market. Our sulfur-based fertilizer products compete with several large fertilizer and sulfur product manufacturers. However, the close proximity of our manufacturing plants to our customer base is a competitive advantage for us in the markets we serve and allows us to minimize freight costs and respond quickly to customer requests. Our sulfuric acid products compete with regional producers and importers in the South and Southwest portion of the U.S. from Louisiana to California. 

&#160; 

Seasonality. Sales of our agricultural fertilizer products are partly seasonal as a result of increased demand during the growing season. 

Marine Transportation Segment 

&#160; 

Industry Overview. The inland waterway system is composed of a network of interconnected rivers and canals that serve as water highways and is used to transport vast quantities of products annually. This waterway system extends approximately 26,000 miles, of which 12,000 miles are generally considered significant for domestic commerce. 

&#160; 

The Gulf Coast region is a major hub for petroleum refining. The petroleum refining process generates products and by-products that require transportation in large quantities from the refinery or processor. Convenient access to and use of this waterway system by the petroleum and petrochemical industry is a major reason for the current location of U.S. refineries and petrochemical facilities. The marine transportation industry uses push boats and tugboats as power sources and tank barges for freight capacity. The combination of the power source and tank barge freight capacity is called a tow. 

&#160; 

Marine Fleet. We utilize a fleet of inland and offshore tows that provide marine transportation of petroleum products and by-products produced in oil refining and natural gas processing. Our marine transportation business operates coastwise along the Gulf of Mexico and East Coast and on the U.S. inland waterway system, primarily between domestic ports along the Gulf of Mexico, Intracoastal Waterway, the Mississippi River system and the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway system. Additionally, we participate in Caribbean, Central America, and South American transport. Our inland tows generally consist of one push boat and one to three tank barges, depending upon the horsepower of the push boat, the river or canal capacity and conditions, and customer requirements. Each of our offshore tows consist of one tugboat, with much greater horsepower than an inland push boat, and one large tank barge. We transport asphalt, fuel oil, gasoline, sulfur and other bulk liquids.

N/A 

Our largest marine transportation customers include major and independent oil and gas refining companies, petroleum marketing companies and Martin Resource Management. We conduct our marine transportation services on a fee basis primarily under annual contracts. 

&#160; 

We are a party to a marine transportation agreement under which we provide marine transportation services to Martin Resource Management on a spot contract basis at applicable market rates. Effective each January 1, this agreement automatically renews for consecutive one-year periods unless either party terminates the agreement by giving written notice to the other party at least 60 days prior to the expiration of the then-applicable term. 

&#160; 

Competition. We compete primarily with other marine transportation companies. Competition in this industry has historically been based primarily on price. However, customers are placing an increased emphasis on safety, environmental compliance, quality of service and the availability of a single source of supply of services. Specifically, customers are increasingly seeking suppliers that can offer marine, land, rail and terminal distribution services while providing a high level of flexibility, health, safety, environmental and financial responsibility, adequate insurance and quality of services consistent with the customer&#8217;s standards. 

&#160; 

In addition to competitors that provide marine transportation services, we also compete with providers of other modes of transportation, such as rail, trucks and, to a lesser extent, pipelines. For example, a typical two inland barge unit carries a volume of product equal to approximately 80 railcars or 250 tanker trucks. Pipelines generally provide a less expensive form of transportation than marine transportation. However, pipelines are not able to transport most of the products we transport and are generally a less flexible form of transportation because they are limited to the fixed point-to-point distribution of commodities in high volumes over extended periods of time.

Related Party Agreements 

The Omnibus Agreement with Martin Resource Management requires us to reimburse Martin Resource Management for all direct expenses it incurs or payments it makes on our behalf or in connection with the operation of our business. We reimbursed Martin Resource Management for $149.3 million , $183.2 million &#32;and $177.1 million &#32;of direct costs and expenses for the years ended December 31, &#32; 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. There is no monetary limitation on the amount we are required to reimburse Martin Resource Management for direct expenses. 

In addition to the direct expenses, under the Omnibus Agreement, we are required to reimburse Martin Resource Management for indirect general and administrative and corporate overhead expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the conflicts committee of our general partner ("Conflicts Committee") approved reimbursement amounts of $13.7 million, $12.5 million and $10.6 million, respectively, reflecting our allocable share of such expenses. The Conflicts Committee will review and approve future adjustments in the reimbursement amount for indirect expenses, if any, annually. These indirect expenses covered the centralized corporate functions Martin Resource Management provides for us, such as accounting, treasury, clerical, engineering, legal, billing, information technology, administration of insurance, environmental and safety compliance, general office expenses and employee benefit plans and other general corporate overhead functions we share with Martin Resource Management&#8217;s retained businesses. The Omnibus Agreement also contains significant non-compete provisions and indemnity obligations. Martin Resource Management also licenses certain of its trademarks and trade names to us under the Omnibus Agreement. 

&#160; 

Other agreements include, but are not limited to, a motor carrier agreement, marine transportation agreements, terminal services agreements, a tolling agreement, and a sulfuric acid sales agency agreement.

&#160; 

Commercial 

&#160; 

We have been and anticipate that we will continue to be both a significant customer and supplier of products and services offered by Martin Resource Management. Our motor carrier agreement with Martin Resource Management provides us with access to Martin Resource Management&#8217;s fleet of road vehicles and road trailers to provide land transportation in the areas served by Martin Resource Management. Our ability to utilize Martin Resource Management&#8217;s land transportation operations is currently a key component of our integrated distribution network. 

&#160; 

In the aggregate, our purchases from Martin Resource Management accounted for approximately 9% , 7% , and 8% &#32;of our total cost of products sold during for the years ended December 31, &#32; 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. We also purchase marine fuel from Martin Resource Management, which we account for as an operating expense. 

&#160; 

Correspondingly, Martin Resource Management is one of our significant customers. Our sales to Martin Resource Management accounted for approximately 11% &#32;of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, &#32; 2015 &#32;and 6% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, &#32; 2014 , and 2013 . We have entered into certain agreements with Martin Resource Management pursuant to which we provide terminalling and storage and marine transportation services to its subsidiary, Martin Energy Services LLC ("MES"), and MES provides terminal services to us to handle lubricants, greases and drilling fluids. Additionally, we have entered into a long-term, fee for services-based tolling agreement with Martin Resource Management where Martin Resource Management agrees to pay us for the processing of its crude oil into finished products, including naphthenic lubricants, distillates, asphalt and other intermediate cuts. 

For a more comprehensive discussion concerning the Omnibus Agreement and the other agreements that we have entered into with Martin Resource Management, please see "Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence." 

&#160; 

Approval and Review of Related Party Transactions 

If we contemplate entering into a transaction, other than a routine or in the ordinary course of business transaction, in which a related person will have a direct or indirect material interest, the proposed transaction is submitted for consideration to the board of directors of our general partner or to our management, as appropriate. If the board of directors is involved in the approval process, it determines whether to refer the matter to the Conflicts Committee, as provided under our limited partnership agreement. If a matter is referred to the Conflicts Committee, it obtains information regarding the proposed transaction from management and determines whether to engage independent legal counsel or an independent financial advisor to advise the members of the committee regarding the transaction. If the Conflicts Committee retains such counsel or financial advisor, it considers such advice and, in the case of a financial advisor, such advisor&#8217;s opinion as to whether the transaction is fair and reasonable to us and to our unitholders. 

Insurance 

Our deductible for onshore physical damage resulting from named windstorms is 5% of the total value located at an individual location subject to an overall minimum deductible of $3.5 million for damage caused by the named windstorm at all locations. Our onshore program currently provides $40.0 million per occurrence for named windstorm events. For non-windstorm events, our deductible applicable to onshore physical damage is $1.0 million per occurrence. Business interruption coverage in connection with a windstorm event is subject to the same $40.0 million per occurrence and aggregate limit as the property damage coverage and a waiting period of 45 days. For non-windstorm events, our waiting period applicable to business interruption is 30 days. 

Our deductible for physical damage at our refining, blending and packaging division in Smackover, Arkansas is $0.5 million per occurrence. The waiting period applicable to business interruption is 30 days. 

We have various pollution liability policies which provide coverages ranging from remediation of our property to third party liability. The limits of these policies vary based on our assessments of exposure at each location. 

&#160; 

Loss of, or damage to, our vessels and cargo is insured through hull and cargo insurance policies. Vessel operating liabilities such as collision, cargo, environmental and personal injury are insured primarily through our participation in mutual insurance associations and other reinsurance arrangements, pursuant to which we are potentially exposed to assessments in the event claims by us or other members exceed available funds and reinsurance. Protection and indemnity ("P&#38;I") insurance coverage is provided by P&#38;I associations and other insurance underwriters. Our vessels are entered in P&#38;I associations that are parties to a pooling agreement, known as the International Group Pooling Agreement ("Pooling Agreement") through which approximately 90% of the world's ocean-going tonnage is reinsured through a group reinsurance policy. With regard to collision coverage, the first $1.0 million of coverage is insured by our hull policy and any excess is insured by a P&#38;I association. We insure our owned cargo through a domestic insurance company. We insure cargo owned by third parties through our P&#38;I coverage. As a member of P&#38;I associations that are parties to the Pooling Agreement, we are subject to supplemental calls payable to the associations of which we are a member, based on our claims record and the other members of the other P&#38;I associations that are parties to the Pooling Agreement. Except for our marine operations, we self-insure against liability exposure up to a predetermined amount, beyond which we are covered by catastrophe insurance coverage. 

For marine claims, our insurance covers up to $1.0 billion of liability per accident or occurrence. We believe our current insurance coverage is adequate to protect us against most accident related risks involved in the conduct of our business. However, there can be no assurance that all risks are adequately insured against, that any particular claim will be paid by the insurer, or that we will be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future. 

Environmental and Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

Our activities are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as orders of regulatory bodies, governing a wide variety of matters, including marketing, production, pricing, community right-to-know, protection of the environment, safety and other matters. 

&#160; 

Environmental 

&#160; 

We are subject to complex federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of human health, natural resources and the environment. These laws and regulations can impair our operations that affect the environment in many ways, such as requiring the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities; restricting the manner in which we can release materials into the environment; requiring remedial activities or capital expenditures to mitigate pollution from former or current operations; and imposing substantial liabilities on us for pollution resulting from our operations. Many environmental laws and regulations can impose joint and several, strict liability, and any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and, in some circumstances, the issuance of injunctions that can limit or prohibit our operations. 

The clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and, thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Moreover, there is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations due to our handling of petroleum products and by-products, chemical substances, and wastes as well as the accidental release or spill of such materials into the environment. Consequently, we cannot provide assurance that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as result of such handling practices, releases or spills, including those relating to claims for damage to property and persons. In the event of future increases in costs, we may be unable to pass on those increases to our customers. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements would not have a material adverse impact on us, we cannot provide any assurance that our environmental compliance expenditures will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future. 

&#160; 

Superfund 

&#160; 

The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, ("CERCLA"), also known as the "Superfund" law, and similar state laws, impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of "responsible persons," including the owner or operator of a site where regulated hazardous substances have been released into the environment and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at such site. Under CERCLA, these responsible persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural 

resources, and for the costs of certain health studies, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Although certain hydrocarbons are not subject to CERCLA&#8217;s reach because "petroleum" is excluded from CERCLA&#8217;s definition of a "hazardous substance," in the course of our ordinary operations we will generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a "hazardous substance." In addition, some state counterparts to CERCLA tie liability to a broader set of substances than does CERCLA. 

&#160; 

Solid Waste 

&#160; 

We generate both hazardous and nonhazardous solid wastes, which are subject to requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended ("RCRA") and comparable state statutes. From time to time, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") has considered making changes in nonhazardous waste standards that would result in stricter disposal requirements for these wastes. Furthermore, it is possible some wastes generated by us that are currently classified as nonhazardous may in the future be designated as "hazardous wastes," resulting in the wastes being subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Changes in applicable regulations may result in an increase in our capital expenditures or operating expenses. 

&#160; 

We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that have been used for the manufacturing, processing, transportation and storage of petroleum products and by-products. Solid waste disposal practices within oil and gas related industries have improved over the years with the passage and implementation of various environmental laws and regulations. Nevertheless, a possibility exists that petroleum and other solid wastes may have been disposed of on or under various properties owned or leased by us during the operating history of those facilities. In addition, a number of these properties have been operated by third parties over whom we had no control as to such entities&#8217; handling of petroleum, petroleum by-products or other wastes and the manner in which such substances may have been disposed of or released. State and federal laws and regulations applicable to oil and natural gas wastes and properties have gradually become more strict and, under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination, including groundwater contamination, even under circumstances where such contamination resulted from past operations of third parties. 

Clean Air Act 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act ("CAA"), as amended, and comparable state statutes. Amendments to the CAA adopted in 1990 contain provisions that may result in the imposition of increasingly stringent pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from the operations of our terminal facilities, processing and storage facilities and fertilizer and related products manufacturing and processing facilities. Such air pollution control requirements may include specific equipment or technologies to control emissions, permits with emissions and operational limitations, pre-approval of new or modified projects or facilities producing air emissions, and similar measures. For example, the Neches Terminal is located in an EPA-designated ozone non-attainment area, referred to as the Beaumont/Port Arthur non-attainment area, which is subject to a EPA-adopted 8-hour standard for complying with the national standard for ozone. In addition, existing sources of air emissions in the Beaumont/Port Arthur area are already subject to stringent emission reduction requirements. Failure to comply with applicable air statutes or regulations may lead to the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, and/or result in the limitation or cessation of construction or operation of certain air emission sources. We believe our operations, including our manufacturing, processing and storage facilities and terminals, are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements of the CAA and analogous state laws. 

&#160; 

Global Warming and Climate Change . Recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as "greenhouse gases" and including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. In response to such studies, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered climate change-related legislation to restrict greenhouse gas emissions. At least 17 states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Also, as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s decision on April 2, 2007, in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA , the EPA eventually concluded that it is required to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources (e.g., cars and trucks) even if Congress does not adopt new legislation specifically addressing emissions of greenhouse gases. The Court's holding in Massachusetts &#32;that greenhouse gases fall under the federal CAA's definition of air pollutant has also led the EPA to determine that regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under various Clean Air Act programs is required. To that end, EPA promulgated regulations, referred to as the Tailoring Rule, 75 Fed. Red. 31514, to begin gradually subjecting stationary greenhouse gas emission sources to various Clean Air Act programs, including permitting programs applicable to new and existing major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. To date, such requirements have not had 

a substantial effect upon our operations. Still, new legislation or regulatory programs that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business could adversely affect our operations and demand for our services. 

&#160; 

Clean Water Act 

&#160; 

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as Clean Water Act and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including hydrocarbon-bearing wastes, into state waters and waters of the U.S.. Pursuant to the Clean Water Act and similar state laws, a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or state permit, or both, must be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal and state waters. In addition, the Clean Water Act and comparable state laws require that individual permits or coverage under general permits be obtained by subject facilities for discharges of storm water runoff. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with Clean Water Act permitting requirements as well as the conditions imposed thereunder, and that our continued compliance with such existing permit conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

&#160; 

Oil Pollution Act 

&#160; 

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended ("OPA") imposes a variety of regulations on "responsible parties" related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in U.S. waters. A "responsible party" includes the owner or operator of a facility or vessel or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. The OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages including natural resource damages. Under the OPA, vessels and shore facilities handling, storing, or transporting oil are required to develop and implement oil spill response plans, and vessels greater than 300 tons in weight must provide to the U.S. Coast Guard evidence of financial responsibility to cover the costs of cleaning up oil spills from such vessels. The OPA also requires that all newly constructed tank barges engaged in oil transportation in the U.S. be double hulled and all existing single hull tank barges be retrofitted with double hulls or phased out by 2015. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all of the oil spill-related and financial responsibility requirements. Nonetheless, in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010, Congress has from time to time considered oil spill related legislation that could have the effect of substantially increasing financial responsibility requirements and potential fines and damages for violations and discharges subject to the OPA, and similar legislation. Any such changes in law affecting areas where we conduct business could materially affect our operations. 

Safety Regulation 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s marine transportation operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Coast Guard, federal laws, state laws and certain international treaties. Tank ships, push boats, tugboats and barges are required to meet construction and repair standards established by the American Bureau of Shipping, a private organization, and the U.S. Coast Guard and to meet operational and safety standards presently established by the U.S. Coast Guard. We believe our marine operations and our terminals are in substantial compliance with current applicable safety requirements. 

&#160; 

Occupational Health Regulations 

&#160; 

The workplaces associated with our manufacturing, processing, terminal and storage facilities are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes. We believe we have conducted our operations in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances. Our marine vessel operations are also subject to safety and operational standards established and monitored by the U.S. Coast Guard. 

&#160; 

In general, we expect to increase our expenditures relating to compliance with likely higher industry and regulatory safety standards such as those described above. These expenditures cannot be accurately estimated at this time, but we do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

Jones Act 

&#160; 

The Jones Act is a federal law that restricts maritime transportation between locations in the U.S. to vessels built and registered in the U.S. and owned and manned by U.S. citizens. Since we engage in maritime transportation between locations in the U.S., we are subject to the provisions of the law. As a result, we are responsible for monitoring the ownership of our subsidiaries that engage in maritime transportation and for taking any remedial action necessary to ensure that no violation of the Jones Act ownership restrictions occurs. The Jones Act also requires that all U.S.-flagged vessels be manned by U.S. citizens. Foreign-flagged seamen generally receive lower wages and benefits than those received by U.S. citizen seamen. This 

requirement significantly increases operating costs of U.S.-flagged vessel operations compared to foreign-flagged vessel operations. Certain foreign governments subsidize their nations&#8217; shipyards. This results in lower shipyard costs both for new vessels and repairs than those paid by U.S.-flagged vessel owners. The U.S. Coast Guard and American Bureau of Shipping maintain the most stringent regimen of vessel inspection in the world, which tends to result in higher regulatory compliance costs for U.S.-flagged operators than for owners of vessels registered under foreign flags of convenience. 

&#160; 

Merchant Marine Act of 1936 

&#160; 

The Merchant Marine Act of 1936 is a federal law that provides that, upon proclamation by the President of the U.S. of a national emergency or a threat to the national security, the U.S. Secretary of Transportation may requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by U.S. citizens (including us, provided that we are considered a U.S. citizen for this purpose). If one of our push boats, tugboats or tank barges were purchased or requisitioned by the U.S. government under this law, we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or, in the case of a requisition, the fair market value of charter hire. However, if one of our push boats or tugboats is requisitioned or purchased and its associated tank barge is left idle, we would not be entitled to receive any compensation for the lost revenues resulting from the idled barge. We also would not be entitled to be compensated for any consequential damages we suffer as a result of the requisition or purchase of any of our push boats, tugboats or tank barges. 

Employees 

&#160; 

We do not have any employees. Under our Omnibus Agreement with Martin Resource Management, Martin Resource Management provides us with corporate staff and support services. These services include centralized corporate functions, such as accounting, treasury, engineering, information technology, insurance, administration of employee benefit plans and other corporate services. Martin Resource Management employs approximately 871 individuals, including 54 employees represented by labor unions, who provide direct support to our operations as of December 31, 2015.
