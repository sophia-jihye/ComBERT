Our Company 

&#160; 

Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the "Company," "Crimson," "we," "our" or "us" as used herein refer to Crimson Win e Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries . Crimson has been conducting business since 1991. Prior to February 25, 2013, Crimson was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leucadia National Corporation (&#8220;Leucadia&#8221;). On February 1, 2013, Leucadia declared a pro rata dividend of all of the outstanding shares of Crimson&#8217;s common stock in a manner that was structured to qualify as a tax-free spin-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the &#8220;Distribution&#8221;). Leucadia&#8217;s common shareholders received one share of Crimson common stock for every ten common shares of Leucadia, with cash in lieu of fractional shares, on February 25, 2013. &#160; 

&#160; 

Crimson is in the business of producing and selling ultra-premium and luxury wines (i.e., wines that retail for $14 to $25 and over $25 per 750ml bottle, respectively). Crimson is headquartered in Napa, California and th rough its subsidiaries owns f our wineries: Pine Ridge Vineyards, Archery Summit, Chamisal Vineyards and &#160; Seghesio Family Vineyards. In addition, Crimson owns Double Canyon Vineyards which owns land in the Horse Heaven Hills of Washington&#8217;s Columbia Valley.

References to cases of wine herein refer to nine-liter equivalent cases. &#160; 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our s trategy is built on three pillars: Quality, Focus and Growth. 

&#160; 

Quality . We believe we own some of the highest qualit y vineyards in the U.S . We farm our vineyards in a thoughtful, sustainable way with the goal of producing the highest quality grapes and the highest quality wines possible . As part of executing this strategy, Crimson currently owns or leases &#160; approximately 895 plantable acres of vineyard land in California, Oregon and Washington. The Company continue s to assess other opportunities to enhance the quality of our vineyard holdings and win e portfolio . 

&#160; 

Focus . We currently own five complementary estate-based winegrowing operations , with each having a unique varietal focus best suited to its specific appellation and region . We have a group of accomplished winegrowing teams &#160; who are each responsible for crafting benchmark wine s from their respective wine regions . Many of Crimson&#8217;s brands are issued ratings or scores by local and national wine rating organizations and we believe our scores are a reflection of our focus on what we do best. 

&#160; 

Growth . To support our quality and focus goals, all of our teams, including winegrowing, sales, marketing and administrative are driven towards continuous improvement. Our direct to consumer business c ontinued to grow in 2015 , with net sales in this channel increasing 5% as compared to 2014 . The direct to consumer business generally generates higher gross margins and we intend to continue building this distribution channel in order to further our growth. Our wholesale distribution channel also continued to grow in 2015 , with net sales in this channel inc reasing 7% as compared to 2014. Our wines are available in all states domestically through our network of 49 distributors, and o ur export team served customers in over 40 countries through independent importers and brokers during 2015 . 

&#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

In December 2015, we opened the Estates Wine Room, an 1,800-square-foot urban tasting room located in Seattle&#8217;s historic Pioneer Square. The Estates Wine Room focuses on selling wines from Crimson's Northwest holdings &#8211; Double Canyon (Horse Heaven H ills, Washington), Archery Summ it (Willamette Valley, Oregon) and in March of 2016 will add wines from Seven Hills Winery (Walla Walla, Washington). 

&#160; 

&#160;

On January 27, 2016, we &#160; entered into &#160; a purchase agreement pursuant to which we acquired, or have rights in, substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities with respect to Seven Hills Winery , located in Walla Walla, Washington. Seven Hills has established a storied wine program with a strong history of accolades for both Merlot and Bordeaux-style red blends, and the acquisition of Seven Hills Winery provides a strategic opportunity for Cr imson to expand its portfolio.

Starting with the 2010 vintage, Double Canyon Vineyards produced and bottled its first wine under the Double Canyon brand name. Since the launch of the Double Canyon brand name, Double Canyon Vineyards has developed a growth plan and significantly expanded production. During 2015, the majority of the grapes from the Double Canyon Vineyards were used for the Double Canyon brand .

Double Canyon Vineyards continues to increase its focus and volume in the wholesale channel for the Horse Heaven Hills Cabernet Sauvignon , including expansion across all U.S. markets in 2016 . 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The markets for ultra - premium and luxury products in the wine industry are intensely competitive. Crimson&#8217;s wines compete domestically and internationally with premium or higher quality wines produced in Europe, South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, as well as in the United States. Crimson competes on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution capability, and the ultimate consumer has many choices of products from both domestic and international producers. A result of the intense competition has been, and may continue to be, upward pressure on Crimson&#8217;s selling and promotional expenses. Many of Crimson&#8217;s competitors are significantly larger with greater financial, production, distribution and marketing resources. The U.S. is dominated by three large wineries with production largely based in California, representing approximately 50% of the domestic U.S. case sales volume. Further, Crimson&#8217;s wines may be considered to compete with all alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages. 

&#160; 

Demand for ultra- premium and luxury wines can rise and fall with general economic conditions, and is also significantly affected by grape supply. Based on industry wide volume increases in th ese wine categor ies , Crimson believes more people are drinking wine than in the past. Crimson&#8217;s wines are typically sold at retail price points from $15 to $250 per bottle , however, in the wholesale channel, which represented 89% &#160; of Crimson&#8217;s case volume in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and 88% in the year ended December 31, 2013, the majority of volume is in the $1 5 to $25 &#160; range to our wholesale distributors . 

&#160; 

Business Segments 

&#160; 

Cri mson reports operating results in two segments: Wholesale and Direct to Consumer. These business segments reflect how the Company&#8217;s operations are evaluated by senior management and the structure of its internal financial reporting. Both financial and certain nonfinancial data are reported and evaluated to assist senior management with strategic planning. The Company evaluates performance based on the gross profit of the respective business segments. Selling expenses that can be directly attributable to the segment are included, however, centralized selling expenses and general and administrative expenses are not allocated between operating segments. Therefore, net income information for the respective segments is not available. Based on the nature of the Company&#8217;s business, revenue generating assets are utilized across segments. Therefore, discrete financial information related to segment assets and other balance sheet data is not available and that information continues to be aggregated. Further information about segments, including sales, cost of sales, gross margin, directly attributable selling expenses, and contribution margin of the segments for the years ended December 31, 201 5, 2014 and 2013 , can be found in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements . 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Crimson focuses on brand development and distribution to increase revenues and profitability, which has included acquisitions of vineyards and wineries and the development of new brands with existing assets. 

&#160; 

Crimson&#8217;s sales and marketing team coordinates the sales and distribution of its various brands, maintains domestic and export distributor relationships and oversees the timing and allocation of new releases. The sales team has employees in major markets in the U.S. and internationally and, where required, as brokers in certain markets. Crimson&#8217;s wines are available through many principal retail channels for premium table wines, including fine wine restaurants, hotels, specialty shops, supermarkets and club stores, in all states domestically , as well as cruise lines and over 40 countries throughout the world. 

&#160; 

Crimson believes that the quality and locations of its wineries and tasting facilities help to create demand for its brands at the consumer level which positively impacts sales to distributors as well. Crimson participates in many wine tasting and other promotional events throughout the country in order to increase awareness and demand for its products. Many of Crimson&#8217;s brands are issued ratings or scores by local and national wine rating organizations, and higher scores will usually translate into greater demand and higher pri cing. 

&#160; 

Wholesale 

&#160; 

Crimson&#8217;s wines are primarily sold to distributors, who then sell to retailers and restaurants. Domestic sales of Crimson&#8217;s wines are made through 49 independent wine and spirits distributors. International sales are made through independent importers and brokers. &#160; During 2015 , d omestic distributor sales represented &#160; 54 % of net sales &#160; and export sales represented 5% of net sales . 

&#160; 

During 2015, Crimson&#8217;s wines were distributed predominantly by two distributors whi ch in aggregate accounted for 25 % of net sales. 

&#160; 

Direct to Consumer 

&#160; 

As permitted under federal and local regulations, Crimson has been placing increasing emphasis on direct sales to consumers, which it is able to do through the Internet, wine clubs, and at the wineries&#8217; tasting rooms. During 2015, direct sales to consumers repr esented 35 % of net sales . Approximately 62 % of the direct to consumer net sales were through wine clubs, 24 % were through the wineries&#8217; tasting rooms and the balance from e-commerce, special events and reimbursement for freight expense . Members typically join our wine clubs after visiting our tasting rooms at our various facilities, or after hearing about our wine clubs from other members. Our tasting rooms are located in vacation areas that typically attract consumers interested in winemaking and touring the area. Direct sales to consumers are more profitable for Crimson as it is able to sell its products at a price closer to retail prices rather than the wholesale price received from distributors, however, for certain direct sales offers, some of the profit is offset by freight subsidies. 

&#160; 

Grape Supply 

&#160; 

Crimson controls approximately 895 acres of vineyards in the Napa Valley, Sonoma County and Edna Valley in California, the Willamette Valley in Oregon and the Horse Heaven Hills in Washington; approximately 74 0 acres of these vineyards are planted, with the majority of the unplanted acres in Washington. Crimson expects to continue vineyard development plans for the non-producing California and Oregon properties and there are plans in place to plant additional acres in Washington. Newly planted vines take approximately four to five years to reach maturity and vineyards can be expected to have a useful life of 25 years before replanting is necessary. Depending on the site, soil and water conditions and spacing, Crimson&#8217;s experience has been that it costs approximately $20,000 to $60,000 per acre over a three year period to develop open land into a producing premium wine grape vineyard, before taking into account the cost of the land. During 2015 &#160; the average cost per acre placed into service was approximately $40,000 per acre. 

&#160; 

In 201 5 , approximately 3 1 % of Crimson&#8217;s total grape supply came from Crimson controlled vineyards. Crimson purchases the balance of its supply from approximately 80 independent growers. The grower contracts range from one-year spot market purchases to intermediate and long term-agreements. During 2015, one grower represented 10% of Crimson&#8217;s grape supply and no other single grower represented 10% or more of Crimson&#8217;s grape supply. 

&#160; 

Winemaking and grape growing are subject to a variety of agricultural risks. Various diseases, pests and certain weather conditions can materially and adversely affect the quality and quantity of grapes available to Crimson thereby materially and adversely affecting the supply of Crimson&#8217;s products and its profitability. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The table below summarizes Crimson&#8217;s wine grape supply and production from the last three harvests:

Cases shipped are disclosed for informational purposes, but do not necessarily correspond to the vintage year the grapes are grown and crushed. Depending on the wine, the production cycle to bottled sales is anywhere from one to three years. 

&#160; 

Winemaking 

&#160; 

Crimson&#8217;s winemaking philosophy includes the use of the latest industry winemaking advances to complement making wine in the traditional manner by starting with high quality fruit and handling it as gently and naturally as possible all the way to the bottle. Each of Crimson&#8217;s wineries is equipped with modern crush, fermentation and storage equipment as well as technology that is focused on producing the highest quality wines for each of the varietals it produces. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Wine production and sales are subject to extensive regulation by the United States Department of Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (&#8220;TTB&#8221;), the California Department of Alcohol Beverage Control (&#8220;CABC&#8221;) and other state and federal governmental authorities that regulate interstate sales, licensing, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising and other activities. In recent years, federal and state authorities have required warning labels on beverages containing alcohol. Restrictions or taxes imposed by government authorities on the sale of wine could increase the retail price of wine, which could have an adverse effect on demand for wine in general. New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees or excise taxes on wine, if enacted, could reduce demand for wine and have an adverse effect on Crimson&#8217;s business, negatively impacting Crimson&#8217;s results of operations and cash flows. 

&#160; 

Crimson is also subject to a broad range of federal and state regulatory requirements regarding its agricultural operations and practices. Crimson&#8217;s agricultural operations are subject to regulations governing the storage and use of fertilizers, fungicides, herbicides, pesticides, fuels, solvents and other chemicals. These regulations are subject to change and conceivably could have a significant impact on operating practices, chemical usage, and other aspects of Crimson&#8217;s business. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement and transportation of grapes. The wine industry in general historically experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues and net income. Typically, Crimson has lower sales and net income during the first quarter and higher sales and net income during the fourth quarter due to seasonal holiday buying as well as wine club shipment timing. Crimson expects these trends to continue. &#160; 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 201 5 , Crimson employed 169 regular, full-time employees. Crimson also employs part-time and seasonal workers for its vineyard, production and hospitality operations. None of Crimson&#8217;s employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and Crimson believes that its relationship with its employees is good. 

&#160; 

Trademarks 

&#160; 

Crimson maintains federal trademark registrations for its brands, proprietary products and certain logos, motifs and vineyard names. International trademark registrations are also maintained where it is appropriate to do so. Each of the United States trademark registrations is renewable indefinitely so long as the Company is making a bona fide usage of the trademark. The Company believes that its trademarks provide it with an important competitive advantage and has established a global network of attorneys, as well as branding, advertising and licensing professionals, to procure, maintain, protect, enhance and gain value from these registrations. 

&#160;

&#160;

The Company is subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). Accordingly, the Company files periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;).
