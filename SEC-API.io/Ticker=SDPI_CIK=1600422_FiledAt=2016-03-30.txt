Overview 

&#160;

We currently have three basic operations:

&#160;

&#183; Our PDC drill bit refurbishing and manufacturing service, &#183; Our emerging technologies business that manufactures the Drill N Ream well bore conditioning tool, Strider Oscillation system, and custom drill tool products to customer specifications, and &#183; Our new product development business that conducts our research and development, and designs our new completion bits, horizontal drill string enhancement tools, other down-hole drilling technologies, and drilling tool manufacturing technologies. &#160;

From our headquarters in Vernal, Utah, we operate a technologically-advanced PDC drill bit refurbishing facility, as well as a state-of-the-art, high-tech drilling and completion tool engineering design and manufacturing operation. We manufacture our drill string enhancement tools, including the patented &#8220;Drill N Ream&#8221; well bore enhancement tool and Strider Oscillation system, and conduct our new product research and development from this facility. We believe that we continue to set the trend in oil and gas drill bit and drill string tool technology and design.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our co-founder, Troy Meier, developed the first commercially-viable process for refurbishing PDC drill bits after a successful 13-year career with a predecessor of our largest client, Baker Hughes. For the past 20 years, we have exclusively provided our PDC drill bit refurbishing services for the Rocky Mountain, California and Alaska regions of Baker Hughes&#8217;s substantial oil field operations. In addition, we have expanded our offerings and our customer base by demonstrating our engineering, design and manufacturing expertise of down-hole drilling tools. We continuously work with our customers to develop new products and enhancements to existing products, improve efficiency and safety, and solve complex drilling tool problems. We employ a senior work force with special training and extensive experience related to drill bit refurbishing and tooling manufacture. They produce our products and services using a suite of highly technical, purpose-built equipment, much of which we design and manufacture for our proprietary use. Most of our manufacturing equipment and products use advanced, patent-pending technologies that enable us to increase efficiency, enhance drill bit integrity, and improve safety.

&#160;

The Company reports as a single segment. The Company&#8217;s revenues are derived from five (5) products or service groups, manufacturing, refurbishing, repairs, rental of tools and sales of tools. As these related revenue sources are to a single industry, the Company has determined to report as a single segment.

&#160; 

Oil and Gas Drilling Industry 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Drilling and completion of oil and gas wells are part of the oilfield services group within the energy industry. The drilling industry is often segmented into the North American market and the International market. These markets share common exposure to the same macro environment, but also exhibit unique factors that drive the dynamics of each market.

&#160;

Oilfield services companies drill the wells for hydrocarbon exploration and production (&#8220;E&#38;P&#8221;) companies. Demand for onshore drilling is a function of the willingness of E&#38;P companies to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce hydrocarbons. When oil or natural gas prices increase, E&#38;P companies generally increase their capital expenditures, resulting in greater revenues and profits for both drillers and equipment manufacturers. Likewise, as discussed below under &#8220;&#8211; Trends in the Industry,&#8221; significant decreases in the prices of those commodities typically lead E&#38;P companies, as we have seen in recent months, to reduce their capital expenditures, which decreases the demand for drilling equipment.

&#160;

Most oil and gas operators do not own their own rigs and instead rely on specialized rig contractors to provide the rig and the crew. Drilling contractors typically provide the rig and the operating crews to E&#38;P companies on a day-rate basis. In the U.S., drilling contracts are normally by well or a short-term period ( e.g., 90 days). Internationally, the contracts are normally one to three years. International contracts are longer because the E&#38;P company usually owns a larger field and the mobilization costs are prohibitive for anything less than a one-year term.

&#160;

&#160;

Drill Bits 

&#160; 

Historical . The first drill bits used in the oil drilling industry were &#8220;fish tail&#8221; bits that were relatively durable, but very slow. In 1909, Howard Hughes Sr. patented the first two-cone rotary bit. In 1931, two Hughes engineers invented the &#8220;Tricone&#8221;, a roller cone drill bit with three cones. The Hughes patent for the Tricone bit lasted until 1951, after which other companies made similar bits. By the early 1980s, the PDC fixed cutter drill bit had gained market traction. PDC fixed cutter bits have no rolling cones or other moving parts. Instead they have ridges studded with synthetic black diamond &#8220;cutters&#8221; or PDCs, and drilling occurs due to shearing the rock as the bit is rotated by the drill string. The vast majority of drilling today is with PDC bits.

&#160; 

Hybrid Drill Bit &#8212; Cutting Mechanics . Today&#8217;s modern hybrid drill bit combines the Tricone roller configuration with PDC fixed cutter framework. These hybrid bits provide &#8220;rolling torque&#8221; management: the dual action cutting structures balance down-hole dynamics for greatly enhanced stability, bit life, and drilling efficiency. Baker Hughes is a leader in hybrid bit technology and is utilizing our capabilities to grow this business.

&#160;

Trends in the Industry 

&#160;

We believe that the following trends will affect the oilfield drilling industry, and consequently the demand for our products in the coming years.

&#160; 

Declining Rig Count; Industry Volatility. Our business is highly dependent upon the vibrancy of the oil and gas drilling operations in the U.S. During the latter half of 2014 and throughout 2015, oil prices dramatically declined in the United States and as a result, the number of operating drilling rigs began to be reduced. Worldwide military, political and economic events have contributed to oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. For example, the NYMEX-WTI oil price has recently been as low as $26.68, while the NYMEX-Henry Hub natural gas price has recently been as low as $1.83 per MMBtu. Per Baker Hughes weekly rotary rig count has now decreased over 70% from the high of 1,840 as of December 24, 2014 to 489 as of March 4, 2016. 2015 was a very challenging year for us as we worked to expand the market share with our Drill N Ream tool and introduce the Strider tool against these massive headwinds.

&#160;

For 2016, we expect the continued decline in the oil and gas industry to be sustained until the pricing of oil stabilizes around the world, providing greater certainty for our customers and their capital investment plans. Our drill bit refurbishment business has decreased for our exclusive customer due to the drop in drilling activity for that business, which has impacted our pricing and volume of repairs, even though this client is a leading supplier of drill bits to the oil &#38; gas exploration and production industry globally. We believe the value of our Drill N Ream and Strider tools and our low market penetration provide us sales opportunities despite these current market conditions. Our plan is for the tool rental sales to help offset the decline in our PDC drill bit refurbishment business and our third party manufacturing services business.

&#160; 

Advent of horizontal drilling requires new technologies . The oil and gas industry is increasingly using directional (e.g., horizontal) drilling in their exploration and production activities because of measurably improved recovery rates that can be achieved with these methods. With the rise of this type of drilling, traditional drill string tools used for vertical drilling do not necessarily provide the best performance or are not well suited for directional drilling. We believe that with our extensive knowledge and experience in the oilfield industry we can identify these challenges and design and develop tools that will help our customers with their drilling challenges. Further development of drill string components, such as our Drill N Ream and Strider tools, will become increasingly important to our business as we continue to grow through both organic expansion and strategic acquisitions.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We believe that our Drill N Ream and Strider tools are well suited for horizontal drilling activity. In addition, we are developing additional technologies to take advantage of the oil and gas industry&#8217;s significant shift to horizontal drilling and its resulting need for new horizontal drill string tools and technology.

&#160; 

Our Drill Bit Refurbishment and Manufacturing Business 

&#160;

As the refurbishing industry grew, our arrangement with Baker Hughes is an agreement to perform our drill bit refurbishment work exclusively for Baker Hughes&#8217; Rocky Mountain region and points west, including the significant oil-producing states of California and Alaska. Today, we believe that we continue to lead the industry in drill bit repair technology &#8211; continually improving repair techniques to improve drill bit performance and efficiency.

&#160;

Halliburton to Acquire Baker Hughes . During 2014, Halliburton announced its planned acquisition of Baker Hughes. Currently Baker Hughes is our sole customer for our bit refurbishment business and we do not know how this acquisition may impact our business. Despite this, we intend to continue developing our long-time relationship with Baker Hughes. During the month of January 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Baker Hughes to supply the Strider tool and related services to Baker Hughes.

&#160; 

Our Horizontal Drilling Tools 

&#160; 

Drill N Ream Well Bore Conditioning Tool . The Drill N Ream is a dual-section reaming tool which is located behind the bottom hole assembly (BHA) to smooth and slightly enlarge the well drift in the curved and horizontal sections of horizontal wells, in both oil and water based mud. The Drill N Ream is available in multiple sizes and can be custom manufactured to fit any hole size. The Drill N Ream tool conditions the well bore and allows the drill string to move through a conditioned well bore left by the drill bit with less friction and material stress, extending the horizontal distance that can be drilled during a run and making tripping (removal of the drill string) and the running of casing in the completed well much easier. Each time a drilling operator has to trip the drill string and replace a bit or other drill string component, it costs the operator substantial time and money, so we believe anything that allows each run to extend further is of great value to our customers. We are also developing a suite of other horizontal drill string tools, each of which addresses a different technical challenge presented by today&#8217;s horizontal drilling designs.

&#160;

The Drill N Ream tool conditions the well bore tortuosity brought about from the drill bit geo-steering, and from directional drilling overcorrections and formation interactions. As a result, the Drill N Ream extends the horizontal distance of the well bore by (a) smoothing out ledges and doglegs left by the bit, which allows the drill string to move through a conditioned well bore with less friction and stress, (b) reducing tool joint damages and trip time (i.e. the time required to pull up and resend the drill string), and (c) enhancing the power available to drive the drill bit assembly.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Specifically,

&#160;

&#183; We expect that our field sales and tool distribution organization that we have developed will support the Drill N Ream rental revenue, subject to limits on our business resulting from the decrease in oil and gas market in 2016. &#160;

&#183; The Drill N Ream tool is specifically designed to reduce the drill string stress and downtime, and therefore the cost, of drilling a horizontal well. &#160;

&#183; We believe that the Drill N Ream&#8217;s adoption and continued use by operators supports it effectiveness and industry acceptance. In addition, we understand that a number of customers have rented the Drill N Ream tool after first trying its competitors. We expect the above factors to support increasing interest in, and revenues from, the Drill N Ream over the next several years as more well operators are (a) contacted by our larger sales force, and (b) reports of its effectiveness are transmitted through word-of-mouth by an increasing user base to other well operators. &#160;

Strider Drill String Oscillation System (&#8220;Strider&#8221;) . The Strider utilizes its unique patent-pending design to reduce drill string friction on horizontal wells, resulting in improved rates of penetration and cost savings. Its revolutionary engineering provides a cost-effective alternative to conventional downhole vibration tools. Strider is designed to help dissipate the inertial drag of a horizontal drill string by generating rhythmic pulses that break the frictional connection between the drill strings and well bore greatly enhancing drilling rates.

&#160;

&#183; The Strider tool is composed of two main parts, a hydraulic channeling chamber (HCC) and a rhythmic pulsation chamber (RPC). The RPC contains a precisely engineered, high speed pulse-valve that systematically restricts flow area. During flow restriction, or &#8220;closure&#8221;, the ideal amount of fluid is allowed to continue down hole. This perfectly controlled hydraulic flow produces an optimal pulse frequency of three thrusts per second, which is preferred for bottom hole assembly equipment. The low frequency also allows for placement of the Strider tool to the bit closer than typical oscillation tools. &#160;

We believe that our Strider tool is at the forefront of drill string tool technological development for horizontal drilling. We believe our technology in the drill string stimulation tool offers significant advantages over our competitors and we believe our Strider tool will be rapidly accepted in the drilling market.

&#160;

During the month of January 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Baker Hughes to supply the Strider tool and related services to Baker Hughes. Tool shipments associated with the agreement are expected to begin during the first quarter of 2016. The agreement has no set expiration date or minimum shipment requirement. It will remain in force until it is canceled by either us or Baker Hughes, as stipulated in the agreement.

&#160; 

V-Stream advanced conditioning system (&#8220;V-Stream&#8221;). The V-Stream tool is an integral spiral blade stabilizer and is engineered to combine stabilization with reaming. A cavity or plenum in the middle of the blades facilities enhanced fluid flow for cuttings transport and reduces torque when compared to typical stabilizers with similar overall blade length. Non-active cutters at gauge enable the V-Stream to remove formation and condition the hole while controlling deviation. With these unique features, the V-Stream will stabilize the BHA and condition the hole simultaneously to optimize the drilling operations.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Dedicated Reamer Stinger (&#8220;DR Stinger&#8221;). DR Stinger is designed to optimize dedicated reamer operations. DR Stinger utilized our fully patented Drill-n-Ream tool with its dual stage eccentric reamers which conditions well bores by increasing well bore drift. The two reamer stages spaced approximately five feet apart act in unison to force each other into the formation while efficiently reducing ledges, doglegs, and well bore tortuosity. With DR Stinger, a tapered stinger is placed just below the Drill-n-Ream tool at the end of the drill string. The DR Stinger eliminates any bit costs during the reamer operation as it is run without a bit, offering a much better indication of hole conditions. Floats are included in the DR Stinger, as well as an anti-plug port system with both of these features eliminating any plugging of the drill string. With no bit on the DR Stringer, the drill string will find and keep well bore center preventing unplanned side tracks.

&#160;

New Product Development and Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our sales and earnings are influenced by our ability to provide the high-level service that our customers demand successfully, which in turn relies on our ability to develop new processes, technology, and products. We have also historically dedicated additional resources toward the development of new technology and equipment to enhance the effectiveness, safety, and efficiency of the products and services we provide. During 2015, research and development costs were approximately $1.2 million, but for 2016, we expect that it will decrease due to the company&#8217;s focus on increasing revenue from our existing commercial products and cost cutting measures from the slowdown of the oil and gas industry.

&#160;

Although we highly value our proprietary products and technology, we also depend on our technological capabilities, customer service oriented culture, and application of our know-how to distinguish ourselves from our competitors. We also consider the services we provide to our customers, and the technical knowledge and skill of our personnel, to be more important than our registered intellectual property in our ability to compete. While we stress the importance of our research and development programs, the technical challenges and market uncertainties associated with the development and successful introduction of new and updated products are such that we cannot assure investors that we will realize any particular amount of future revenue from the services and related products resulting from our research and development programs.

&#160;

Suppliers and Raw Materials 

&#160; 

We acquire supplies, component parts, products and raw materials from suppliers, including steel suppliers, foundries, forge shops and original equipment manufacturers. The prices we pay for our raw materials may be affected by, among other things, energy, industrial diamond, steel and other commodity prices, tariffs and duties on imported materials and foreign currency exchange rates. Certain of our component parts, products or specific raw materials are only available from a limited number of suppliers.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our ability to obtain suitable quality raw materials and components, such as PDC&#8217;s, steel and flux, solder and heating elements, is critical to our ability to remanufacture Baker Hughes drill bits, and to manufacture the Drill N Ream and Strider tool and other future drill line products. In order to purchase raw materials and components in timely and cost effective manner, we have developed both domestic and international sourcing connections and arrangements. We maintain quality assurance and testing programs to analyze and test these raw materials and components in order to assure their compliance with our rigorous specifications and standards. We generally try to purchase our raw materials from multiple suppliers so we are not dependent on any one supplier, but this is not always possible.

&#160;

Because Baker Hughes pays the cost of direct materials and supplies used in our drill bit refurbishing process, cost increases are not as critical as short-term financial components for that line of business. However, the price and availability of commodities and components, in particular steel, can have an impact on our operations. We have no assurance that we will be able to continue to purchase these raw materials on a timely basis or at historical prices.

&#160; 

Proprietary Rights 

&#160;

We rely primarily on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures, and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology. Mr. Meier currently has U.S. patent applications pending, and related international patent applications pending as co-inventor, and individually with respect to the Strider and other pending horizontal drilling tools. There is no assurance that our patent applications will result in issued patents, that the existing patents or that any future patents issued to us will provide any competitive advantages for their products or technology, or that, if challenged, the patents issued to us will be held valid and enforceable. Despite our precautions, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Existing intellectual property laws afford only limited protection and policing violations of such laws is difficult. The laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be used by our customers do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. There is no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology, gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary information, or design around our patents.

&#160;

We may be required to enter into costly litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend infringement claims by others. Such infringement claims could require us to license the intellectual property rights of third parties. There is no assurance that such licenses would be available on reasonable terms, or at all.

&#160;

Marketing and Sales 

&#160; 

We do not engage in any marketing or sales efforts for our PDC drill bit refurbishing in the oil and gas industry because we are under an exclusive contract with Baker Hughes for those services.

&#160;

For the Drill N Ream and Strider tool, sales and marketing infrastructure was established by creating &#8220;stocking points&#8221; where tool inventory can be maintained and modestly repaired. We also established a sales and marketing team comprised of &#8220;city sales&#8221; and &#8220;field sales&#8221; employees. Our recent sales and marketing history with the Drill N Ream tool has been largely in North Dakota&#8217;s Bakken oil field, Utah, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, Colorado and Texas. Our plan is to expand the Drill N Ream tool&#8217;s coverage by targeting a substantially expanded sales and marketing effort in Ohio, and Pennsylvania, among other areas.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our Strider tool agreement with Baker Hughes provides an acceptance in the market for this tool. The Strider tool has been deployed in North Dakota&#8217;s Bakken oil field, Oklahoma and Wyoming, with the goal to expand to other surrounding states in the near future.

&#160;

Growth Strategies 

&#160; 

We intend to pursue the following growth strategies as we seek to expand our market share and solidify our position as a competitive drilling and completion tool manufacturer in the drilling and completion industry:

&#160;

&#183; Leverage of Hard Rock . We have grown Hard Rock&#8217;s marketing team, which has more than 25 years of oil field customer contacts, with our Team&#8217;s extensive connections in the drilling industry, in order to achieve greater market penetration and revenues for the Drill N Ream tool. We have used the Hard Rock marketing and sales team to propel our upcoming drill string component products successfully into the drilling marketplace and have taken that expertise to grow a larger sales and marketing force. &#160;

&#183; Leverage the Strider tool . We will use the Hard Rock marketing and sales team as our sales force for Strider. The Strider tool addresses a niche opportunity in the oil and gas production market place because of the technological advancements in its design as well as the efficiencies developed in its production. The sales group will be able to sell both the Drill N Ream and Strider tool, as they can both be on the same drill string. We will also leverage our Baker Hughes agreement to increase our market penetration. &#160;

&#183; Continue to enhance our Baker Hughes relationship . We have now added our Strider tool agreement to our drill bit refurbishing business with Baker Hughes. We will continue to develop our long-time relationship with Baker Hughes and look for other ways partner with them. &#160;

&#183; Strengthen and support our employees . Our experienced employees and management team are our most valuable resources. Attracting, training, and retaining key personnel, has been, and will remain critical to our success. To achieve our goals, we intend to remain focused on providing our employees with training, personal and professional growth opportunities, as well as adding performance-based incentives, including opportunities for stock ownership, and other competitive benefits. We are also working with the local university and high school to develop and teach local programs in machining and engineering expertise and technical resources. &#160; 

&#183; Seek strategic acquisitions to enhance or expand our product lines . While capital constraints and careful capital allocation discipline requires investment in organic growth, we are continually looking to find new technologies to add to our arsenal of tools for the exploration and production industry. In analyzing new acquisitions, we intend to pursue opportunities that complement our existing product line and/or that are geographically situated and served by our current and future sales force. We believe that strategic acquisitions will enable us to exploit economies of scale in the areas of finance, human resources, marketing, administration, information technology, and legal, while also providing cross-marketing opportunities among our drill tool product offerings. &#160; 

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Competitive Strengths 

&#160;

We believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competitors on the basis of the quality and reliability of our products and services, our proprietary technology, and our ability to rapidly respond with products that meet the most demanding needs of our customers.

&#160;

&#183; Industry-recognized expertise and innovation . We believe that we have developed a strong reputation for producing quality products and services based upon our industry-recognized depth of experience, ability to attract and retain quality employees, and innovative processes and applications. We believe that a number of the drill bit refurbishing processes and technologies that we developed have now become industry standards. &#160;

&#183; Experienced management team with proven track record . Our executive officers and senior operational managers have extensive experience both with us and in the oil field service industry generally. Our chief executive officer and co-founder, Troy Meier, has a 33-year relationship with Baker Hughes, providing innovative ideas to support Baker Hughes in maintaining their leadership role in the drill bit industry. Meier family entities continue to own the majority of our outstanding stock which we believe aligns their interests with the interests of our public investors. &#160; 

&#183; Cutting-edge manufacturing capacity and proprietary technology . We have created and designed a cutting-edge machining facility with custom features. We recruited and hired a high level, cross-industry machining team to produce our products and services using a suite of highly technical, computer controlled, purpose-built equipment, much of which we design and manufacture for our proprietary use. Most of our manufacturing equipment and products now use advanced, patent-pending technologies that enable us to increase efficiency, enhance the integrity and precision drill bit and drill string tool integrity, and improve safety. &#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Drill Bit Refurbishing. The primary competitors for our drill bit refurbishing services are the in-house units at Hughes Christensen, the division of Baker Hughes responsible for drill bits. Other drill bit manufacturers also have in-house refurbishing units, but they are not our competitors because of our exclusive contract with Baker Hughes.

&#160;

Drilling Enhancement Tools . The primary competitors for our Drill N Ream tool are several single-section reaming tool manufacturers, including Baker Oil Tools (a division of Baker Hughes), NOV, and Schlumberger. We believe that the Drill N Ream tool is the only patented dual-section or dual cutting structure drill string reamer on the market today. We believe that distinction will allow us to continue building on the Drill N Ream tool&#8217;s first-mover advantage.

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We believe that our Strider tool is at the forefront of drill string tool technological development for horizontal drilling. There are existing tools that would compete with the drill string stimulation tool, such as the Agitator tool marketed by NOV. However, we believe our technology in the drill string stimulation tool offers significant advantages over the Agitator and we believe our Strider tool will be rapidly accepted in the drilling market.

&#160;

Customers 

&#160; 

Distributor/Agent Relationships and Customer Diversification . With the expansion of our tool offerings, we have increased our customer base as well as our sales infrastructure and our channels to market. We recently established an agreement with Baker Hughes to be a market channel partner for new customers of our Strider tool. We are also working on additional prospective channel partners. By increasing our capabilities and renting or selling products to our customers, we have diversified our customer base and sources of revenue. Our manufacturing technologies operations also provide us diversification opportunities as we can design and manufacture to customer specifications new technologies under development.

&#160; 

Drill Bit Refurbishing . Our sole customer for our drill bit refurbishing services is Hughes Christensen, the division of Baker Hughes responsible for drill bits, under our exclusive long-term contract with them. We work directly with their field engineers, manufacturing and marketing representatives to develop new products and enhancements, improve efficiency and safety, and solve complex drilling tool problems.

&#160; 

Drill String Tools . E&#38;P operators, other oil field services companies and distributors are demanding key technologies, such as advanced directional drilling and more complex completion systems in order to reduce costs resource requirements and tie to production. We believe that there will be significant opportunities to bring new products and equipment to market, such as our Drill N Ream and Strider tools, that have been designed and engineered with these new challenges in mind.

&#160;

Seasonality 

&#160; 

A substantial portion of our business is not significantly impacted by changing seasons. A small portion of the revenue we generate from selected operations may benefit from higher first quarter activity levels, as operators take advantage of the winter freeze to gain access to remote drilling and production areas. In the past, some of our revenue in Alaska has declined during the second quarter due to warming weather conditions that resulted in thawing, softer ground, difficulty accessing drill sites and road bans that curtailed drilling activity.

&#160;

Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to numerous stringent and complex laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to human health and environmental protection, and we have put a strong focus on these issues.

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We designed and built our Vernal facility as a fully-contained business park, except for the city sewer connection. Underlying our entire facility, including parking lots and runoff storage areas, is a complete capture and containment field that collects all building drainage and ground run off in isolated tanks. Captured drainage and runoff, as well as all hazardous waste generated in our manufacturing processes is regularly removed from our facility by a certified hazardous waste disposal company. However, the trend in environmental regulation has been to impose increasingly stringent restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or in enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Moreover, accidental releases or spills of regulated substances may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations or to obtain or comply with permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial or corrective action requirements, and the imposition of orders or injunctions to prohibit or restrict certain activities or force future compliance.

&#160;

The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance could have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.

&#160;

Hazardous Substances and Waste . The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220; RCRA &#8221;) and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. We are required to manage the transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes in compliance with RCRA.

&#160;

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (&#8220; CERCLA &#8221;), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for manufacturing and other operations for many years. We also contract with waste removal services and landfills. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment.

&#160;

Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the &#8220; Clean Water Act &#8221;) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. A responsible party includes the owner or operator of a facility from which a discharge occurs. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, together with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning, as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges.

&#160; 

Employee Health and Safety. We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including OSHA and comparable state statutes, establishing requirements to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. Substantial fines and penalties can be imposed and orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain operations may be issued in connection with any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.

&#160;

There is no assurance that any present or future noncompliance with Environmental Laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations or financial condition. See &#160;&#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221;

&#160;

Insurance and Risk Management 

&#160; 

We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable for companies of our size and with similar operations. In accordance with industry practice, however, we do not maintain insurance coverage against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. Therefore, there is a risk our insurance program may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or all losses.

&#160;

Currently, our insurance program includes, among other things, general liability, umbrella liability, sudden and accidental pollution, personal property, vehicle, workers&#8217; compensation, directors and officers and employer&#8217;s liability coverage. Our insurance includes various limits and deductibles or retentions, which must be met prior to or in conjunction with recovery.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 66 full-time employees compared with 95 full-time employees at the same time in December 2014. We generally have been able to locate and engage highly qualified employees as needed. None of our employees are covered by an ongoing collective bargaining agreement, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We consider our employee relations to be good.
