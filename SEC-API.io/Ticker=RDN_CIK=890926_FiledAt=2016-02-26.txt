Mortgage Insurance 

A. 

Business 

Overview 

Our Mortgage Insurance segment provides credit-related insurance coverage, principally through private mortgage insurance, to mortgage lending institutions nationwide. Private mortgage insurance plays an important role in the U.S. housing finance system by protecting mortgage lenders and investors by mitigating default-related losses on residential mortgage loans. These loans are made to home buyers who generally make down payments of less than 20% of the home&#8217;s purchase price. Private mortgage insurance promotes affordable home ownership by facilitating the sale of these loans in the secondary mortgage market, most of which are sold to the GSEs. 

See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Key Factors Affecting Our Results&#8212;Mortgage Insurance.&#8221; 

Operating Environment 

We are a seller of mortgage credit protection and therefore, the demand for our products and services is largely driven by the health of the housing and mortgage finance markets. In addition to total mortgage origination volumes, mortgage insurance industry volumes are impacted by the mix between mortgage originations that are for purchased homes versus refinancings. Historically, mortgage insurance penetration in the overall insurable mortgage market is meaningfully higher for mortgage originations that are for purchased homes compared to refinancings. While the mortgage origination market for 2016 is expected to be lower than it was in 2015, mortgage origination volume from home purchases is expected to comprise a higher percentage of the overall mortgage origination market in 2016. As a result, we expect our NIW for 2016 to be comparable to our NIW for 2015 of $41.4 billion . 

Our businesses are also impacted by macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the mortgage origination environment and the credit performance of our underlying insured assets. The credit performance of loans originated after 2008 is significantly better than that of the loans in our Legacy Portfolio, as post-2008 loan originations have primarily consisted of prime loans with excellent credit quality. Further, the improving macroeconomic environment has contributed to the positive credit trends in our mortgage insurance portfolio, including a decrease in the number of new defaults as well as improved cure rates. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations&#8212;Mortgage Insurance.&#8221; At the same time, while credit quality has been improving, the restrictive credit environment has limited purchase loan originations by making it more challenging for many first-time home buyers to finance a home. 

The positive macroeconomic and credit trends, while contributing to the improved financial strength of existing private mortgage insurers, have encouraged newer entrants into the private mortgage insurance industry. This has resulted in an increasingly competitive environment for private mortgage insurers. In addition to other private mortgage insurers, our primary competitors are the FHA and the VA. See &#8220;&#8212;Competition.&#8221; 

Regulatory Environment 

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulations and other requirements. State insurance regulators impose various capital requirements on our insurance subsidiaries. For our insurance subsidiaries, these include Risk-to-capital, other risk-based capital measures and surplus requirements. The GSEs are the primary beneficiaries of most of our mortgage insurance and they impose eligibility requirements that private mortgage insurers must satisfy to be approved to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. In 2015, the FHFA issued the final PMIERs which became effective on December 31, 2015 and set forth revised requirements for private mortgage insurers, including Radian Guaranty, to remain eligible insurers of loans purchased by the GSEs. The PMIERs Financial Requirements require private mortgage insurers to hold significantly more capital than under the previous eligibility requirements. In addition, the PMIERs requirements are comprehensive, covering virtually all aspects of the business and operations of a private mortgage insurer. See &#8220;&#8212;Regulation.&#8221; Radian Guaranty currently is in compliance with the requirements of the PMIERs. Changes in the charters or business practices of the GSEs can have a significant impact on our business. 

&#32;13 

Part I Item 1. Business 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Mortgage Insurance Products 

Traditional types of private mortgage insurance include &#8220;primary mortgage insurance&#8221; and &#8220;pool insurance.&#8221; 

Traditional Risk - Primary Mortgage Insurance. Primary mortgage insurance provides protection against mortgage defaults at a specified coverage percentage. When there is a valid claim under primary mortgage insurance, the maximum liability is determined by multiplying the claim amount, which consists of the unpaid loan principal, plus past due interest and certain expenses associated with the default, by the coverage percentage. Claims may be settled for the maximum liability or for other amounts. See &#8220;&#8212;Claims Management&#8221; below. 

The terms of our primary mortgage insurance coverage are set forth in a master insurance policy that we enter into with each of our customers. Our Master Policies are filed in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Among other things, our Master Policies set forth the terms and conditions of our mortgage insurance coverage, including: loan eligibility requirements; premium payment requirements; coverage term; provisions for policy administration; exclusions or reductions in coverage; claims payment and settlement procedures; and dispute resolution procedures. 

Following the financial crisis, the FHFA and the GSEs identified specific requirements to be included by all private mortgage insurers in their Master Policies for new mortgage insurance applications received on or after October 1, 2014. Among others, these included specific requirements related to loss mitigation and claims processing activities. Radian Guaranty incorporated these principles into its new 2014 Master Policy. Loans that were already insured prior to the October 1, 2014 effective date of the 2014 Master Policy will continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of Radian Guaranty&#8217;s Prior Master Policy. Any material changes to the 2014 Master Policy are subject to approval by the GSEs and state regulatory approval. 

One of the significant changes under the 2014 Master Policy is the inclusion of new rescission relief programs. Subject to certain limited exceptions, including fraud and misrepresentation, the 2014 Master Policy provides that we will not rescind coverage on a loan after 36 months if it meets the following criteria: no loan payment has been 60-days or more delinquent and not more than two loan payments were 30-days delinquent or more in the first 36 months; the 36 th &#32;loan payment is not 30-days or more delinquent; all loan payments are made from a borrower&#8217;s own funds; and the loan is not subject to a workout. In addition, Radian Guaranty&#8217;s Confident Coverage SM &#32;program allows lenders to opt in for earlier rescission relief at 12 months if certain additional conditions are satisfied, including that the lender submits specific origination and closing loan file documents for Radian Guaranty&#8217;s review and the first 12 months of payments were timely and from the borrower&#8217;s own funds. 

We provide primary mortgage insurance on a flow basis and we also provide primary mortgage insurance on a &#8220;structured&#8221; basis, which includes business that we have written to insure a group of individual loans. In flow transactions, mortgages typically are insured as they are originated, while in our Structured Transactions, we typically provide insurance on a group of mortgages after they have been originated. A portion of our structured business has been written in a &#8220;second loss&#8221; position, meaning that we are not required to make a payment until a certain aggregate amount of losses have already been recognized on a given set of loans. See &#8220;Mortgage Insurance Portfolio&#8212;Direct Risk in Force&#8212; Mortgage Loan Characteristics. &#8221; A single structured mortgage insurance transaction may be provided on a primary basis or, as discussed below, on a pool basis; and some Structured Transactions include both primary and pool insured mortgages. 

We wrote $41.4 billion &#32;and $37.3 billion &#32;of first-lien primary mortgage insurance in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Based on publicly available information, we estimate that our share of the new insurance written within the private mortgage insurance market (excluding HARP refinancings) was 19.2% and 22.2% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Substantially all of our primary mortgage insurance written during 2015 and 2014 was written on a flow basis. Primary insurance on first-lien mortgage loans made up $44.6 billion &#32;or 97.5% &#32;of our total direct first-lien insurance RIF at December 31, 2015, compared to $43.2 billion &#32;or 96.8% &#32;at December 31, 2014. 

Traditional Risk - Pool Insurance. Prior to 2008, we wrote pool insurance on a limited basis. Pool insurance differs from primary insurance in that our maximum liability is not limited to a specific coverage percentage on an individual mortgage loan. Instead, an aggregate exposure limit, or &#8220;stop loss&#8221; (generally between 1% and 10%), is applied to the initial aggregate loan balance on a group or &#8220;pool&#8221; of mortgages. In addition to a stop loss, many of our pool policies were written in a second loss position. We believe the stop loss and second loss features have been important in limiting our ultimate liability on individual pool transactions. The terms of our pool policies are privately negotiated and are separate from the Master Policies that we use for our primary mortgage insurance. 

We wrote much of our pool insurance in the form of Structured Transactions, such as credit enhancement on loans in pools purchased by the GSEs as well as loans included in RMBS transactions. An insured pool of mortgages may contain mortgages that are already covered by primary mortgage insurance. In these transactions, pool insurance is secondary to any primary mortgage insurance that exists on mortgages within the pool. 

&#32;14 

Part I Item 1. Business 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Pool insurance made up approximately $1.1 billion &#32;or 2.5% &#32;of our total direct first-lien insurance RIF at December 31, 2015, as compared to $1.4 billion &#32;or 3.2% &#32;at December 31, 2014. 

Non-Traditional Risk. In addition to traditional mortgage insurance, in the past, we provided other forms of credit enhancement on residential mortgage assets. Our non-traditional products, which included mortgage insurance on Second-liens, generally have higher risk characteristics. We stopped writing these forms of &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; business before 2008. We also provided mortgage insurance on an international basis. In 2008, we stopped writing new international business and have terminated most of our international mortgage insurance risk, with the exception of our insured portfolio in Hong Kong. While we are no longer writing new business in Hong Kong, we continue to insure the existing book of business, which has experienced a low default rate. Our total amount of non-traditional RIF, including our international RIF, was $49 million &#32;at December 31, 2015, as compared to $73 million &#32;at December 31, 2014. 

Premium Rates 

We set our premium rates when coverage is established, which is generally at the time of origination. Premiums for our mortgage insurance products are established based on performance models that consider a broad range of borrower, loan and property characteristics. Our premium rates are generally subject to regulation, and in most states where our insurance subsidiaries are licensed, our premiums must be filed, and in some cases approved, before their use. See &#8220;Regulation&#8212;State Regulation.&#8221; 

We set our premium levels to be competitive within the mortgage insurance industry and to achieve an overall risk-adjusted rate of return on capital given our modeled performance expectations. Our actual returns may differ from our expectations based on market conditions and other factors. The sensitivity of our returns to market conditions will vary based on factors such as whether the insurance is borrower-paid or lender-paid, and whether the payments are made monthly or in a single premium payment at the time of origination. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Key Factors Affecting Our Results&#8212; Mortgage Insurance&#8212;Premiums. &#8221; 

Among other factors, we set our premium rates based on assumptions about policy performance, including, without limitation, our expectations and assumptions about the following factors: (1) the likelihood of default; (2) how long the policy will remain in place; (3) the costs of acquiring and maintaining the insurance; (4) taxes; and (5) the capital that is required to support the insurance. Our performance assumptions for claim frequency and policy life are developed based on data regarding our own historical experience, as well as data generated from independent, third-party sources. 

Premiums on our mortgage insurance products are generally paid either on a monthly installment basis (Monthly Premiums) or in a single payment (Single Premiums). In addition, our Monthly and Other premiums may include premiums that are paid as a combination of up-front premium at origination plus a monthly renewal (split premium), as an annual or other periodic premium paid over multiple years or as premiums paid on mortgage loans after their origination. For Single Premium insurance, we receive a single premium payment that is generally paid at the time of loan origination and, subject to certain conditions, provides coverage for the life of the loan. There are many factors that influence the form of premiums we receive, including: (1) the percentage of mortgage originations derived from refinance transactions versus new home purchases (refinancing transactions often are conducted with Single Premiums); (2) the customers with whom we do business (mix of Monthly Premium and Single Premium business varies by customer); and (3) the relative premium levels we and our competitors set for the various forms of premiums offered. Approximately 69% of our NIW in 2015 was written with Monthly and Other premiums, and 31% was written with Single Premiums. 

Mortgage insurance premiums can be financed through a number of methods, and while the coverage remains for the benefit of the lender, the premiums may be paid by the borrower or by the lender. Borrower-paid mortgage insurance premiums are paid either through separate escrowed amounts or financed as a component of the mortgage loan amount. Lender paid mortgage insurance premiums are paid by the lender and are typically passed through to the borrower in the form of additional origination fees or a higher interest rate on the mortgage note. Our Monthly and Other mortgage insurance premiums are generally established as either: (1) a fixed percentage of the loan&#8217;s amortizing balance over the life of the policy; or (2) as a fixed percentage of the initial loan balance for a set period of time (typically ten years), after which it declines to a lower fixed percentage for the remaining life of the policy. 

Underwriting 

Mortgage loan applications are underwritten to determine whether they are eligible for our mortgage insurance. We perform this function directly or, alternatively, we delegate to our insured lenders the ability to underwrite the mortgage loans based on compliance with our underwriting guidelines. 

&#32;15 

Part I Item 1. Business 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Delegated Underwriting . Through our delegated underwriting program we approve insured lenders to underwrite mortgage loan applications based on our mortgage insurance underwriting guidelines. Each lender participating in the delegated underwriting program must be approved by our risk management group. Utilization of our delegated underwriting program enables us to meet lenders&#8217; demands for immediate insurance coverage and increases the efficiency of the underwriting process. We use quality control sampling and performance monitoring to manage the risks associated with delegated underwriting. Under the terms of the program, we have certain rights to rescind coverage if there has been a deviation from our underwriting guidelines. For a discussion of these limited rescission rights, see &#8220;&#8212;Claims Management&#8212; Rescissions. &#8221; As of December 31, 2015, approximately 70% of our total first-lien IIF had been originated on a delegated basis, compared to 72% as of December 31, 2014. 

Non-Delegated Underwriting . &#160; In addition to our delegated underwriting program, insured lenders may also submit mortgage loan applications to us and we will perform the mortgage insurance underwriting. In general, we are less likely to exercise our rescission rights with respect to underwriting errors related to loans that we underwrite for mortgage insurance. As a result, following a period of high Rescissions after the financial crisis, many lenders have chosen to have us perform the mortgage insurance underwriting, and we have experienced an increase in the amount of business being submitted to us on a non-delegated basis. Given the professional resources we need to maintain to underwrite mortgage loans, an increase in non-delegated underwriting demand generally increases our operating costs to support this program. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 30% of our total first-lien IIF had been originated on a non-delegated basis, compared to 28% as of December 31, 2014. 

Contract Underwriting. We also provide third party contract underwriting services to both our mortgage insurance and Services customers. For a fee, we underwrite our customers&#8217; mortgage loan application files for secondary market compliance (e.g., for sale to the GSEs), and may concurrently assess the file for mortgage insurance eligibility. During 2015, mortgage loans underwritten through contract underwriting accounted for 5.7% of insurance certificates issued as part of our Flow Business. These mortgage loans are included within the non-delegated underwriting percentages discussed above. 

We offer limited indemnification to our contract underwriting customers with respect to those loans that we simultaneously underwrite for both secondary market compliance and for potential mortgage insurance eligibility. In addition, we may, in certain circumstances, offer limited indemnification when we underwrite a loan only for secondary market compliance. The entity and its employees that provide our contract underwriting services are compliant with the SAFE Act in 49 states. We train our underwriters, require continuing education and routinely audit their performance to monitor the accuracy and consistency of underwriting practices. 

B. 

Mortgage Insurance Portfolio 

Direct Risk in Force 

Our business traditionally has involved taking credit risk in various forms across a range of asset classes, products and geographies. Exposure in our mortgage insurance business is measured by RIF, which is equal to the underlying loan unpaid principal balance multiplied by the insurance coverage percentage. 

The following discussion mainly focuses on our direct primary RIF, which represents approximately 97.4% &#32;of our total mortgage insurance RIF of $45.8 billion &#32; at December 31, 2015 . See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations&#8212;Mortgage Insurance&#8212; NIW, IIF, RIF&#8221; &#32;for additional information about the composition of our primary RIF. See &#8220;&#8212;Business&#8212;Mortgage Insurance Products&#8212; Traditional Risk &#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Business&#8212;Mortgage Insurance Products&#8212; Non-Traditional Risk&#8221; &#32;for additional information regarding our pool and non-traditional mortgage insurance RIF. 

We analyze our mortgage insurance portfolio in a number of ways to identify any concentrations or imbalances in risk dispersion. We believe that, among other factors, the credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio is affected significantly by: 

&#8226; 

general economic conditions (in particular home prices and unemployment); 

&#8226; 

the age of the loans insured; 

&#8226; 

the geographic dispersion of the properties securing the insured loans and the condition of the housing market; 

&#8226; 

the quality of underwriting decisions at loan origination; and 

&#8226; 

the credit characteristics of the borrower and the characteristics of the loans insured (including LTV, purpose of the loan, type of loan instrument, source of down payment, and type of underlying property securing the loan).

The amount of time that our insurance certificates remain in force, which is affected by loan repayments and terminations of our insurance, can have a significant impact on our revenues and our results of operations. Our Persistency Rate, which is the percentage of IIF that remains on our books after any 12-month period, is one key measure for assessing the impact that insurance terminations resulting in certificate cancellations have on our IIF. Because our insurance premiums are earned over time, higher Persistency Rates on Monthly Premium Policies increase the premiums we receive and generally result in increased profitability and returns. Conversely, assuming all other factors remain constant, higher Persistency Rates on Single Premium business lowers the overall returns from our insured portfolio, as the premium revenue for our Single Premium Policies is the same regardless of the actual life of the insurance policy and we are required to maintain regulatory capital and Available Assets supporting the insurance for the life of the policy. The Persistency Rate of our primary mortgage insurance was 78.8% &#32; at December 31, 2015 , compared to 84.2% &#32; at December 31, 2014 . Historically, there is a close correlation between interest rates and Persistency Rates, primarily as a result of increased refinancings in lower interest rate environments. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations&#8212;Mortgage Insurance&#8212; NIW, IIF, RIF &#8221; for the details regarding the Persistency Rates.

Mortgage Loan Characteristics 

In addition to geographic dispersion, other factors also contribute significantly to our overall risk diversification and the credit quality of our RIF, including product distribution, underwriting and our risk management practices. We consider a number of borrower and loan characteristics in evaluating the credit quality of our portfolio and developing our pricing and risk management strategies. 

LTV . &#160; An important indicator of claim incidence in our mortgage insurance business is the relative amount of a borrower&#8217;s equity that exists in a home. Generally, absent other mitigating factors such as high FICO scores and other credit factors, loans with higher LTVs at inception (i.e., smaller down payments) are more likely to result in a claim than lower LTV loans. The average origination LTV of our primary NIW in 2015 &#32;was 91.5% , compared to 91.6% &#32;and 91.1% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. See the &#8220;Percentage of primary NIW&#8221; table in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations&#8212;Mortgage Insurance&#8212; NIW, IIF, RIF &#8221; for a breakdown of the composition of our NIW by LTV. 

Loan Grade/FICO Score . &#160; The risk of claim on non-prime loans is significantly higher than that on prime loans. We use our proprietary models to classify a loan as either prime or non-prime on the basis of a borrower&#8217;s FICO score, the level of loan file documentation and other factors. In general we consider a loan to be a prime loan if the borrower&#8217;s FICO score is 620 or higher and the loan file meets &#8220;fully documented&#8221; standards of our credit guidelines and/or the GSE guidelines for fully documented loans. Substantially all of our NIW after 2008 has been on prime loans. See the &#8220;Improved Characteristics of NIW&#8221; table in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations&#8212;Mortgage Insurance&#8212; NIW, IIF, RIF &#8221; for a breakdown of the composition of our NIW by FICO Score and origination vintage ranges. 

Loans that we categorize as Alt-A, A minus loans or B/C loans are considered non-prime loans due to lower FICO scores, reduced loan file documentation, and/or the presence of other risk characteristics. See the &#8220;Primary RIF by Risk Grade&#8221; table in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations&#8212;Mortgage Insurance&#8212; NIW, IIF, RIF &#8221; for a breakdown of the composition of our RIF by risk grade. 

Loan Type &#8212; ARMs; Interest-Only Mortgages . &#160; ARMs are loans that have an initial interest rate that will reset during the life of such loans. Our claim frequency on insured ARMs has been higher than on fixed-rate loans. It has been our experience that the credit performance of loans subject to reset five years or later from origination are less likely to result in a claim than ARMs with shorter initial fixed periods. Approximately 64.4 % of the ARMs we insure have already had initial interest rate resets. An additional 1.8% , 1.9% &#32;and 3.5% &#32;of the ARMs we insure are scheduled to have initial interest rate resets during 2016 , 2017 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. 

See the &#8220;Percentage of primary RIF&#8221; table in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations&#8212;Mortgage Insurance&#8212; NIW, IIF, RIF &#8221; for a breakdown of the composition of our RIF by loan type. 

Loan Purpose. Loan purpose may also impact our risk of loss. For example, cash-out refinance loans, where a borrower receives cash in connection with refinancing a loan, have been more likely to result in a claim than new purchase loans or loans that are refinanced only to adjust rate and term. See the &#8220;Percentage of primary RIF&#8221; table in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations&#8212;Mortgage Insurance&#8212; NIW, IIF, RIF &#8221; for the percentage of our RIF comprised of refinances. 

Loan Size . &#160; Higher-priced properties with larger mortgage loan amounts generally have experienced wider fluctuations in value than moderately priced residences and have been more likely to result in a claim. The average loan size of our direct primary mortgage IIF (by product) as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;was as follows:

We consider other factors, including property type and occupancy type, in assessing our risk of loss. In general, it has been our experience that our risk of claim is lower on loans secured by single family detached housing than loans on other types of properties, and is higher on non-owner occupied homes purchased for investment purposes than on either primary or second homes. 

See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations&#8212;Mortgage Insurance&#8212; NIW, IIF, RIF &#8221; for additional information about the credit quality and characteristics of our direct primary mortgage insurance. 

C. 

Defaults and Claims 

Defaults. In our Mortgage Insurance segment, the default and claim cycle begins with the receipt of a default notice from the loan servicer. We consider a loan to be in default for financial statement and internal tracking purposes upon receipt of notification by servicers that a borrower has missed two monthly payments. Defaults can occur due to a variety of factors, including death or illness, divorce or other family problems, unemployment, overall changes in economic conditions, housing value changes that cause the outstanding mortgage amount to exceed the value of a home or other events. 

The default rate in our mortgage insurance business is subject to seasonality. Historically, our mortgage insurance business experiences a fourth quarter seasonal increase in the number of defaults and a first quarter seasonal decline in the number of defaults and increase in the number of Cures. While this historically has been the case, macroeconomic factors in any given period may influence the default rate in our mortgage insurance business more than seasonality. 

The following graph shows the trend of the number of primary defaults by each vintage year as of the end of each quarter following the year of original policy issuance. 

&#32;

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Since 2009, virtually all of our new mortgage insurance business production has been prime business. The loans from our 2009 and later origination years possess significantly improved credit characteristics compared to our Legacy Portfolio. For example, average FICO scores for the borrowers of these insured mortgages are higher compared to mortgages in our Legacy Portfolio. In addition, refinancings under the HARP programs have had a positive impact on the overall credit quality and composition of our mortgage insurance portfolio because the refinancing generally results in terms under which a borrower has a greater ability to pay and more financial flexibility to cover the loan obligations. Our portfolio of business written since the beginning of 2009 has been steadily increasing in proportion to our total primary RIF. The sum of our 2009 through 2015 &#32;portfolios and our HARP refinancings accounted for approximately 84% of our total primary RIF at December 31, 2015 , compared to 79% at December 31, 2014 . See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations&#8212;Mortgage Insurance&#8221; for additional information about refinancings under the HARP programs.

Claims. Defaulted loans that fail to become current, or &#8220;cure,&#8221; may result in a claim under our mortgage insurance policies. Mortgage insurance claim volume is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the default. The rate at which defaults cure, or do not go to claim, depends in large part on a borrower&#8217;s financial resources and circumstances (including whether the borrower is eligible for a loan modification), local housing prices and housing supply (i.e., whether borrowers are able to cure defaults by selling the property in full satisfaction of all amounts due under the mortgage), interest rates and regional economic conditions. In our first-lien primary insurance business, the insured lender must acquire title to the property (typically through a foreclosure proceeding) before submitting a claim. The time for a lender to acquire title to a property through foreclosure varies depending on the state. Following the financial crisis, the time between a default and a request for claim payment increased, largely as a result of foreclosure delays due to, among other factors, increased scrutiny within the mortgage servicing industry and foreclosure process. Delays in foreclosures have continued to extend the timing of claim submissions, in particular as compared to historical experience. For our pool insurance business, loans are insured under policies separate from the Master Policies used in our primary mortgage insurance business. Typically, our pool policies require the insured to not only acquire title but also to actively market and ultimately liquidate the real estate asset before filing a claim, which generally lengthens the time between a default and a claim submission. 

Claim activity is not spread evenly throughout the coverage period of a book of business. Historically, for prime business relatively few claims are received during the first two years following issuance of a policy, and for non-prime business relatively few are received during the first year. 

See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations&#8212;Mortgage Insurance&#8212; Provision for Losses &#8221; for various claims paid tables, including Direct Claims Paid by Origination Year.

In addition to claim volume, Claim Severity is another significant factor affecting losses. We calculate the Claim Severity by dividing the claim paid amount by the original coverage amount. Factors that impact the severity of a claim include, but are not limited to, the size of the loan, the amount of mortgage insurance coverage placed on the loan, the amount of time between default and claim during which we are expected to cover certain interest and expenses, and the impact of our Loss Mitigation and other loss management activities with respect to the loan. Pre-foreclosure sales, acquisitions and other early workout efforts help to reduce overall Claim Severity, as do actions we may take to reduce claim payment due to servicer negligence, as discussed below in &#8220;Claims Management.&#8221; The average Claim Severity for loans covered by our primary insurance was 105.8% &#32;for 2015 , compared to 100.2% &#32;in 2014 . The increase in the average Claim Severity in 2015 was primarily impacted by claims paid related to the implementation of the BofA Settlement Agreement. 

D. 

Claims Management 

Our claims management process is focused on promptly analyzing and processing claims to ensure that valid claims are paid in a timely and accurate manner. In addition, our mortgage insurance claims management department pursues opportunities to mitigate losses both before and after claims are received. We dedicate significant resources to mortgage insurance claims management. 

We have a dedicated loss mitigation group that works with servicers to identify and pursue loss mitigation opportunities for loans in both our performing and non-performing (defaulted) portfolios. This includes regular surveillance and benchmarking of servicer performance with respect to default reporting, borrower retention efforts, foreclosure alternatives and foreclosure processing. Through this process, we seek to hold servicers accountable for their performance and communicate to servicers identified best practices for servicer performance. We evaluate and consider a number of factors that assess the quality of the loan origination and the loan servicing in determining the extent of our loss mitigation reviews and which loss mitigation strategies to pursue. 

Claims. In our traditional mortgage insurance business, upon receipt of a valid claim, we generally have the following three settlement options: 

(1) 

pay the maximum liability and allow the insured lender to keep title to the property. The maximum liability is determined by multiplying (x) &#32;the claim amount (which consists of the unpaid loan principal, plus past due interest for a period of time specified in our Master Policies and certain expenses associated with the default) by &#32;(y) &#32;the applicable coverage percentage; 

(2) 

pay the amount of the claim required to make the lender whole (not to exceed our maximum liability), following an approved sale; or 

(3) 

pay the full claim amount and acquire title to the property. 

&#32;22 

Part I Item 1. Business 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Approved sales in which the underlying property has been sold for less than the outstanding loan amount are commonly referred to as &#8220;short sales.&#8221; Although short sales may have the effect of reducing our ultimate claim obligation, in many cases, a short sale will result in the payment of a claim in an amount that is equal to the maximum liability amount. Under our Master Policies, we retain the right to consent prior to the consummation of any short sales. Historically, we have consented to a short sale only after reviewing various factors, including among other items, the sale price relative to market and the ability of the borrower to contribute to any shortfall in the sale proceeds as compared to the outstanding loan amount. We have entered into agreements with each of the GSEs, pursuant to which we delegated to the GSEs our prior consent rights with respect to short sales on loans owned by the GSEs, as long as the short sales meet the GSE guidelines and processes for short sales and subject to certain other factors set forth in these agreements. As a result, instead of reviewing each individual transaction prior to short sale with respect to GSE loans, we instead perform a post-claim quality review of these short sales to ensure that they met the specified requirements. We have the ability to terminate our delegated short sale agreements with the GSEs upon 60 days notice. We also provide for limited delegation authority to certain loan servicers for short sales under specific circumstances. For loans that are not owned by the GSEs and for which we have not granted specific delegation authority to the loan servicer, we continue to perform an individual analysis of each proposed short sale and provide our consent to these sales when appropriate. 

After a claim is received, our loss management specialists may focus on: 

&#8226; 

a review to determine compliance with applicable loan origination programs and our mortgage insurance policy requirements, including: (i) whether the loan qualified for insurance at the time the certificate of coverage was issued; and (ii) whether the insured has satisfied its obligation in meeting all necessary conditions in order for us to pay a claim (commonly referred to as &#8220;claim perfection&#8221;), including submitting all necessary documentation in connection with the claim; 

&#8226; 

analysis and prompt processing to ensure that valid claims are paid in an accurate and timely manner; 

&#8226; 

responses to loss mitigation opportunities presented by the insured; and 

&#8226; 

management and disposal of acquired real estate. 

Claim Denials . &#160; We have the legal right under our Master Policies to deny a claim if the loan servicer does not produce documents necessary to perfect a claim, including evidence that the insured has acquired title to the property, within the time period specified in our Master Policies. Most often, a Claim Denial is the result of a servicer&#8217;s inability to provide the loan origination file or other servicing documents for review. If, after requests by us, the loan origination file or other servicing documents are not provided to us, we generally deny the claim. If we deny a claim, we continue to allow the insured the ability to perfect the claim for a period of time specified in our Master Policies. If the insured successfully perfects the claim within our specified timelines, we will process the claim, including a review of the loan to ensure appropriate underwriting and loan servicing. 

Rescissions . &#160; Under the terms of our Master Policies we have the legal right, under certain conditions, to unilaterally rescind coverage on our mortgage insurance policies. If we rescind coverage based on a determination that a loan did not qualify for insurance, we provide the insured with a period of time to challenge, or rebut, our decision. 

Typical events that may give rise to our right to rescind coverage include: (1) we insure a loan under one of our Master Policies in reliance upon an application for insurance that contains a material misstatement, misrepresentation or omission, whether intentional or otherwise, or that was issued as a result of an act of fraud; or (2) we find that there was negligence in the origination of a loan that we insured. We also have rights of rescission arising from a breach of the insured&#8217;s representations and warranties contained in an endorsement to our Master Policies that is required with our delegated underwriting program. In certain circumstances, we may seek to rescind Structured Transactions for breach of representations and warranties pertaining to the insured loans having been underwritten in accordance with the agreed underwriting guidelines and in the absence of any fraud or misrepresentation. 

If a rebuttal to our rescission is received and the insured provides additional information supporting the continuation (i.e., non-rescission) of coverage, we have the claim re-examined internally by a second, independent group. If the additional information supports the continuation of coverage, the insurance is reinstated and the claim is paid. After completion of this process, if we determine that the loan did not qualify for coverage, the insurance certificate is rescinded (and the total premiums paid are refunded) and we consider the rescission to be final and resolved. Although we may make a final determination internally with respect to a rescission, it is possible that a legal challenge to our decision to rescind coverage may be brought after we have rescinded coverage during a period of time that is specified under the terms of our Master Policies. 

&#32;23 

Part I Item 1. Business 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

In 2012, we began offering a limited rescission waiver program under our Prior Master Policy for our delegated underwriting customers, in which we agree not to rescind coverage due to non-compliance with our underwriting guidelines so long as the borrower makes 36 consecutive payments (commencing with the initial required payment) from his or her own funds. This program does not restrict our rights to rescind coverage in the event of fraud or misrepresentation in the origination of the loans we insure. As part of our 2014 Master Policy for NIW after October 1, 2014, we now offer 12-month and 36-month rescission relief programs in accordance with the specified terms and conditions set forth in the new policy. For a discussion of the 2014 Master Policy, see &#8220;&#8212;Business&#8212;Mortgage Insurance Products&#8212; Traditional Risk .&#8221; 

Claim Curtailments . &#160; We also have rights under our Master Policies to curtail, and in some circumstances, deny claims due to servicer negligence. Examples of servicer negligence may include, without limitation: 

&#8226; 

a failure to report information to us on a timely basis as required under our Master Policies; 

&#8226; 

a failure to pursue loss mitigation opportunities presented by borrowers, realtors and/or any other interested parties; 

&#8226; 

a failure to pursue loan modifications and/or refinancings through programs available to borrowers or an undue delay in presenting claims to us (including as a result of improper handling of foreclosure proceedings), which increases the interest or other components of a claim we are required to pay; and 

&#8226; 

a failure to initiate and diligently pursue foreclosure or other appropriate proceedings within the timeframe specified in our Master Policies. 

Although we could seek post-claim recoveries from the beneficiaries of our policies if we later determine that a claim was not valid, because our loss mitigation process is designed to ensure compliance with our policies prior to payment of claim, we have not sought, nor do we currently expect to seek, recoveries from the beneficiaries of our mortgage insurance policies once a claim payment has been made. 

E. 

Risk Management 

Our mortgage insurance business employs a comprehensive risk management function, which is responsible for establishing our credit and counterparty risk policies, monitoring compliance with our policies, managing our insured portfolio and communicating credit related issues to management and the Credit Committee of our Board. See &#8220;&#8212;Enterprise Risk Management&#8221; for additional information on our risk management activities and enterprise risk management strategy. 

Reinsurance&#8212;Ceded. We also use reinsurance as a risk management tool in our mortgage insurance business. 

Third-Party Quota Share Transactions. During 2012, Radian Guaranty entered into two QSR agreements with a third-party reinsurance provider in order to proactively manage Radian Guaranty&#8217;s Risk-to-capital. Through the Initial QSR Transaction, Radian Guaranty agreed to cede to the third-party reinsurance provider 20% of its NIW beginning with the business written in the fourth quarter of 2011. As of December 31, 2015 , RIF ceded under the Initial QSR Transaction was $ 0.8 billion . In the fourth quarter of 2012, Radian Guaranty and the same third-party reinsurance provider entered into the Second QSR Transaction. Effective January 1, 2015, having ceded the maximum amounts permitted under the QSR Transactions, Radian Guaranty is no longer ceding NIW under these agreements. As of December 31, 2015 , RIF ceded under the Second QSR Transaction was $1.3 billion . For additional information regarding the QSR Transactions, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In February 2016, in order to manage the mix of business in our portfolio and to continue managing Radian Guaranty&#8217;s Minimum Required Assets under the PMIERs in a cost-effective manner, we entered into the Single Premium QSR. The Single Premium QSR (including the amount of the benefit to our Minimum Required Assets under PMIERs) remains subject to GSE approval, and therefore, we have not yet begun to cede any business under this agreement. We can provide no assurance if and when the GSEs may approve the Single Premium QSR, and if it is approved, whether it will be approved in its current form or on alternative terms and conditions that are acceptable to us and the third-party reinsurers. 

Affiliate Reinsurance. Certain states limit the amount of risk a mortgage insurer may retain on a single loan to 25% of the total loan amount. Radian Guaranty currently uses reinsurance from an affiliated reinsurer to comply with these insurance regulations. See &#8220;&#8212;Regulation&#8212;State Regulation&#8212; Reinsurance .&#8221; In addition, Radian Guaranty has previously used reinsurance with its subsidiaries to reduce its net RIF and manage its Risk-to-capital position. 

&#32;24 

Part I Item 1. Business 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Captive Reinsurance . &#160; We and other companies in the mortgage insurance industry have participated in reinsurance arrangements with mortgage lenders commonly referred to as &#8220;captive reinsurance arrangements.&#8221; Under captive reinsurance arrangements, a mortgage lender typically established a reinsurance company that assumed part of the risk associated with the portfolio of that lender&#8217;s mortgages insured by us on a flow basis (as compared to mortgages insured in Structured Transactions, which typically were not eligible for captive reinsurance arrangements). In return for the reinsurance company&#8217;s assumption of a portion of the risk, we ceded to the reinsurance company a portion of the mortgage insurance premiums that otherwise would have been paid to us. Captive reinsurance typically was conducted on an &#8220;excess-of-loss&#8221; basis, with the captive reinsurer paying losses only after a certain level of losses had been incurred. In addition, on a limited basis, we participated in &#8220;quota share&#8221; captive reinsurance arrangements under which the captive reinsurance company assumed a pro rata share of all losses in return for a pro rata share of the premiums collected. 

As a result of the housing and related credit market downturn that began in 2007, most captive reinsurance arrangements have &#8220;attached,&#8221; meaning that losses have exceeded the threshold so that we are now entitled to cash recoveries from the captive. Ceded losses recoverable related to captives at December 31, 2015 &#32;were $7.3 million . 

We have terminated a significant portion of our remaining captive reinsurance arrangements on a &#8220;cut-off&#8221; basis, meaning that the terminated captive arrangements were dissolved and all outstanding liabilities were settled. All of our remaining captive reinsurance arrangements are operating on a run-off basis, meaning that no new business is being placed in these captives. We have not entered into any new captive reinsurance arrangements since 2007, and we have an agreement with the Minnesota Department of Commerce that we will not enter into any new captive reinsurance arrangements for a period of ten years ending in June 2025. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Customers 

The principal customers of our mortgage insurance business are mortgage originators such as mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions and community banks. Sources of primary NIW by type of mortgage originator for the year ended December 31, 2015 are shown in the chart below. 

&#32;25 

Part I Item 1. Business 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Beginning in 2009, we launched an initiative to significantly diversify our customer base, including increasing the amount of business we were conducting with credit unions and community banks. Since 2010, we have added approximately 900 &#32;new customers and significantly increased the amount of business derived from mid-sized mortgage banks. We believe these efforts have helped to reduce the potential impact to our business from the loss of any one customer. 

Our top 10 mortgage insurance customers, measured by primary NIW, represented 28.0% &#32;of our primary NIW in 2015 , compared to 22.9% &#32;and 25.8% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Our largest single mortgage insurance customer (including branches and affiliates), measured by primary NIW, accounted for 4.6% &#32;of NIW during 2015 , compared to 4.0% &#32;and 5.8% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Earned premiums attributable to Wells Fargo accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

G. 

Sales, Marketing and Customer Support 

Our sales and account management team is organized in various geographic regions across the U.S. We have a business development group that is focused on developing new mortgage insurance relationships and an account management group that is responsible for supporting our existing mortgage insurance relationships. Mortgage insurance sales and account management personnel are compensated by salary, commissions for NIW and the creation or development of customer relationships and other incentive-based pay, which may be tied to the achievement of certain sales goals or the promotion of certain products. Commissions vary based on product in order to incent a sales person to achieve an appropriate mix of products in accordance with our business objectives. 

A key element of our business strategy is to broaden our participation in the residential mortgage market value chain through our Services segment. We have a dedicated team that is focused on marketing our Services capabilities to our mortgage insurance customers. We expect the continued sales of these complementary products and services to our mortgage insurance customers will strengthen our relationships with those customers and that the availability of these products and services will attract new customers. We believe that offering these complementary services and products differentiates us from our mortgage insurance competitors and enhances our ability to compete in the insured market. 

Additionally, we have established exclusive partnerships with a number of organizations that are focused on supporting minority homeownership, including NAHREP, NAREB and AREAA. We believe that these partnerships will help us establish and deepen our relationship with the growing minority segments of the population that are expected to constitute a significant portion of new household formation in the U.S. in the future. 

We have developed training programs for our customers to help their employees develop the skills to respond to changing market demands and regulatory requirements. Our training is provided to customers to promote the role of private mortgage insurance in the marketplace as well as to promote Radian Guaranty&#8217;s specific products and offerings. We offer training in three format options: instructor-led classroom sessions, instructor-led webinars and self-directed web-based training. In 2015 , we trained more than 41,000 &#32;mortgage professionals both in-person and online, an increase of 38% &#32;from 2014 . 

H. 

Competition 

We operate in the highly competitive U.S. mortgage insurance industry. Our competitors include other private mortgage insurers and federal and state governmental and quasi-governmental agencies, principally the FHA and VA. 

We compete directly with the following six private mortgage insurers: 

&#8226; 

Arch U.S. MI (acquired CMG Mortgage Company effective January 30, 2014); 

&#8226; 

Essent Guaranty Inc.; 

&#8226; 

Genworth Financial Inc.; 

&#8226; 

Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation; 

&#8226; 

NMI Holdings, Inc.; and 

&#8226; 

United Guaranty Corporation. 

&#32;26 

Part I Item 1. Business 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

We compete with other private mortgage insurers primarily on the basis of price, underwriting guidelines, customer relationships, reputation, perceived financial strength (including based on credit ratings) and overall service. Service-based competition includes effective and timely delivery of products, timeliness of claims payments, customer service, timely and accurate servicing of policies, training, loss mitigation efforts and management and field service expertise. Pricing has always been competitive in the mortgage insurance industry. However, the presence of newer entrants in the industry has increased price competition as these companies seek to gain a greater presence in the market and more established industry participants seek to defend their market share and customer relationships. As a result, recent pricing trends have included: (i) the increased use of a spectrum of filed rates to allow for formulaic, risk-based pricing (commonly referred to as &#8220;black-box&#8221; pricing); (ii) a significant increase in the broad use of customized (often discounted) rates on lender-paid, Single Premium policies, and more recently, on borrower-paid, monthly premium policies; and (iii) overall reductions in standard filed rates on borrower-paid policies. The willingness of mortgage insurers to offer reduced pricing (through filed or customized rates) has been met with an increased demand from certain large lenders for reduced rate products. This has further intensified the pricing environment and has resulted in new pricing levels (whether through filed or customized rates) that private mortgage insurers are expected to meet in order to avoid risking a potential significant loss in NIW. 

The heightened pricing competition has occurred in the context of generally higher capital requirements being applied to private mortgage insurers as a result of the PMIERs and more aggressive pricing by the FHA (which is most impactful with respect to high-LTV loans for borrowers with FICO scores below 720). This has produced a marketplace where balancing both targeted returns on new business and an acceptable share of the insured market has become increasingly challenging for all participants. In formulating our strategy in this environment, we have taken a disciplined approach to establishing rates and delivering a mix of business that is expected to produce our targeted level of returns on a blended basis and an acceptable level of NIW. In furtherance of this strategy, we recently: (1) increased our filed rates for lender-paid mortgage insurance; (2) continued to use the authority set forth in our rate filings to provide customized premiums for lender-paid, Single Premium mortgage insurance on a selective and negotiated basis while, importantly, declining to participate in significantly discounted, Single Premium business that has been offered for bid on an aggregated basis (which we estimate represented approximately 5% of the total private mortgage insurance market in 2015); and (3) determined to change our borrower-paid, filed rates in order to remain competitive, which generally will have the effect of decreasing our standard rates on higher FICO business and raising our rates on lower FICO business where the FHA is already very competitive. 

As a result of these changes, we believe we remain well positioned to compete for the high-quality business being originated today and to capture a larger share of the generally more profitable, borrower-paid business, while at the same time maintaining attractive projected returns on NIW within our targeted ranges. While our portfolio returns will depend on a number of factors, including the amount and mix of NIW that we are able to write at these new levels and the amount of reinsurance we use in the future, we currently expect our pricing changes will produce returns on new business on an unlevered basis (i.e., after-tax underwriting returns plus projected investment income) of approximately 13% to 14% and approximately 16% to 17% on a levered basis (i.e., after-tax returns taking into consideration a targeted corporate debt to capital ratio of less than 30%). Most importantly, we believe our pricing actions will allow us to compete more effectively. &#32; 

Certain of our private mortgage insurance competitors are subsidiaries of larger corporations that have access to greater amounts of capital and financial resources than we do at a lower cost of capital (including, as a result of tax-advantaged, off-shore reinsurance vehicles) and have better financial strength ratings than we have. As a result, they may be better positioned to compete outside of traditional mortgage insurance, including if the GSEs pursue alternative forms of credit enhancement other than traditional mortgage insurance. In addition, three of our competitors are newer entrants to the industry and are not burdened by legacy credit risks. 

&#32;27 

Part I Item 1. Business 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

We also compete with governmental and quasi-governmental agencies, principally the FHA and the VA. Beginning in 2008, the FHA, which historically had not been a significant competitor, substantially increased its market share of the insured mortgage market. Since then, the private mortgage insurance industry generally had been recapturing market share from the FHA, primarily due to: improvements in the financial strength of private mortgage insurers; the development of new products and marketing efforts directed at competing with the FHA; increases in the FHA&#8217;s pricing; the U.S. government&#8217;s pursuit of legal remedies against FHA approved lenders related to loans insured by the FHA; as well as various policy changes at the FHA, including the general elimination of the premium cancellation provision. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Key Factors Affecting Our Results &#8212; Mortgage Insurance &#8212; NIW. &#8221; However, in January 2015, the FHA announced a 50 basis point reduction to its annual mortgage insurance premium. This reduction has impacted our competitiveness with respect to certain high-LTV loans to borrowers with FICO scores below 720. As a result, the FHA&#8217;s recent share of the insured market has been increasing once again. 

In addition, we have faced increasing competition from the VA. Based on publicly available information, the VA accounted for 25.4% &#32;of the insurable mortgage market in 2015. We believe that the VA&#8217;s market share has generally been increasing because the VA offers 100% LTV loans and charges a one-time funding fee that can be included in the loan amount but no additional monthly expense, and because of an increase in the number of borrowers that are eligible for the VA&#8217;s program.

Mortgage and Real Estate Services (&#8220;Services&#8221;) 

A. 

Acquisition of Clayton 

On June 30, 2014, we acquired Clayton, a leading provider of services and solutions to the mortgage and real estate industries. In connection with the acquisition of Clayton, we introduced a new reporting segment - Mortgage and Real Estate Services, also referred to as &#8220;Services.&#8221; During the first quarter of 2015, Clayton acquired Red Bell, a real estate brokerage, valuation and technology company. In addition, in October 2015, Clayton acquired ValuAmerica, a national title agency and appraisal management company with a technology platform that helps mortgage lenders and their vendors streamline and manage their supply chains and operational workflow. See Notes 1 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these acquisitions. These acquisitions expanded Clayton&#8217;s scope of services and are consistent with our strategy to provide services throughout the mortgage and real estate industries. 

B. 

Business 

1. 

Services Offered 

Our Services segment consists primarily of Clayton and provides services and solutions to the real estate and mortgage finance industries, including outsourced services, mortgage-related analytics and specialized consulting and surveillance services for buyers and sellers of, and investors in, mortgage- and real estate-related loans and securities as well as other ABS. Our Services segment provides information and services that financial institutions, investors and government entities, among others, use to evaluate, acquire, securitize, service and monitor loans and ABS. The primary services offered are described further below and include: loan review and due diligence; surveillance; valuation and component services and REO management services; and services for the United Kingdom and European mortgage markets offered through Clayton&#8217;s EuroRisk operations. 

Loan Review and Due Diligence. &#160; Our loan review and due diligence services include loan-level due diligence for various asset classes and securitizations, with a primary focus on the residential mortgage and non-GSE RMBS markets. We utilize skilled professionals and proprietary technology to conduct these services, with product offerings focused on credit underwriting, regulatory compliance and collateral valuation. These services help our clients understand the risk contained in a loan file, and provide them with information to help them price, acquire, securitize or service the assets we review. 

As part of our due diligence and review services, we offer credit underwriting reviews and compliance reviews to verify that loan file documentation conforms to specified guidelines and regulatory requirements. We leverage our underwriting expertise to offer mortgage fraud review and re-verification, including identifying breaches in representations and warranties made by sellers of the loans. In addition, we offer data integrity services. 

Surveillance. &#160; Our surveillance services utilize proprietary technology and skilled professionals to provide ongoing, independent monitoring of mortgage servicer and loan performance. We offer risk management and servicing oversight solutions, including RMBS surveillance, regulatory and operational loan level oversight, asset representation review, or ARR, services in connection with securitizations, and consulting services. RMBS surveillance services monitor the servicers of mortgage loans underlying outstanding RMBS. Regulatory and operational oversight provides regular monitoring of servicing operations to measure and assess compliance with applicable policies and regulations. Our ARR services provide targeted loan and receivable oversight for ABS issuers and their investors in the event of certain default triggers within the ABS. Our consulting services are focused on regulatory compliance and operational reviews of both mortgage servicers and loan originators. 

Valuation and Component Services. &#160; Our valuation and component service offerings are primarily focused on the single family rental, or SFR, market, and include valuations, property inspections, title reviews, lease reviews and tax lien reviews. We provide these services and due diligence reviews to issuers of SFR securitizations as well as to lenders and investors in the single family rental market. In addition, we provide valuation services, which primarily consist of broker price opinions, to investors and servicers of non-performing mortgage loans and REO properties, real estate brokerage services and technology solutions, as well as appraisal, title and closing services through Clayton&#8217;s Red Bell and ValuAmerica subsidiaries. 

&#32;29 

Part I Item 1. Business 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

REO Management . &#160; Our REO management services provide management of the entire REO disposition process, including management of the eviction and redemption process, management of property preservation and repairs, property valuation, title reviews and curative work, marketing, offer negotiation and closing services. 

EuroRisk. &#160; Our EuroRisk operations provide outsourced mortgage services in the United Kingdom and Europe, with offerings that include due diligence services, quality control reviews, valuation reviews and consulting services. EuroRisk provides services to mortgage originators and servicers, as well as to investors in performing and non-performing mortgage loans. All of the EuroRisk services revenue is generated in foreign countries, primarily the United Kingdom and Greece. 

Sales volume in our Services segment primarily depends on the overall activity in the mortgage finance market and the health of related industries. We believe the diversity of the services offered by our Services segment, which are intended to cover all phases of the mortgage value chain, will help to support the demand for services throughout various economic and mortgage finance environments. For example, the demand for due diligence services may decrease in unfavorable economic conditions due to lower mortgage origination and securitization volumes, whereas the demand for REO management services may tend to increase in such an environment. In addition, while the size of the mortgage finance market may be adversely impacted by increased regulatory requirements, such as the recently adopted CFPB mortgage servicing standards and the new regulatory requirements for third-party review of loans in asset-backed securities, these requirements may increase the demand for certain of our services, such as surveillance.

3. 

Fee-for-Service Contracts 

Our Services segment is a fee-for-service business. Our services revenue is generated under three basic types of contracts: 

Fixed-Price Contracts. &#160; Under a fixed-price contract, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined per-unit or per-file price. We use fixed-price contracts in our valuation and component services, as well as in our loan review and due diligence services. These contracts are also used in our surveillance business for our servicer oversight services and RMBS surveillance services, as well as in our REO management business. 

Time-and-Expense Contracts. &#160; Under a time-and-expense contract, we are paid a fixed hourly rate, and we are reimbursed for billable out-of-pocket expenses as work is performed. These contracts are used in our loan review and due diligence and EuroRisk services offerings, as well as in the consulting services that we offer as part of our surveillance business. 

Percentage-of-Sale Contracts. &#160; A portion of REO management services are provided under percentage-of-sale contracts, in which we are paid a contractual percentage of the sale proceeds upon the sale of each property. These contracts are only used for our REO management services. 

In most cases, our contracts with our clients do not include minimum volume commitments and can be terminated at any time by our clients. Although some of our contracts and assignments are recurring in nature, and include repetitive monthly assignments, a significant portion of our engagements are transactional in nature and may be performed in connection with securitizations, loan sales, loan purchases or other transactions. Due to the transactional nature of our business, our Services segment revenues may fluctuate from period to period as transactions are commenced or completed.

Customers 

We have a broad range of customers for our Services segment due to the breadth of services we are able to offer across the mortgage value chain. Our principal customers are buyers and sellers of, and investors in, mortgage- and real estate-related loans and securities and other debt instruments. These customers comprise: 

&#8226; 

Banks, credit unions, independent mortgage banks and other originators of mortgage loans; 

&#8226; 

RMBS/ABS issuers, securitization trusts, the GSEs, private equity, hedge funds, REITs, investment banks and other investors in mortgage-related debt instruments, whole loans and other securities; 

&#8226; 

SFR owners; 

&#8226; 

Mortgage servicers; and 

&#8226; 

Regulators and rating agencies involved in the mortgage, real estate and housing finance markets. 

Our clients include many of the largest financial institutions and participants in the mortgage sector and, as such, our services revenue is concentrated among our largest clients. The top ten clients for our Services segment contributed 49% &#32;of the total services revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 . See &#8220;&#8212; Mortgage and Real Estate Services Revenue Drivers.&#8221; 

D. 

Competition 

We believe our Services business is uniquely positioned as a single provider of an array of outsourced services and solutions to participants in the mortgage value chain and that this position differentiates us from our competitors. We are not aware of any other company that provides a comparable range of services to the residential mortgage and real estate industries. However, our Services business has multiple competitors within each of its individual lines of business. Our competitors mainly include small privately-held companies and subsidiaries of large publicly-traded companies.

Discontinued Operations &#8212; Financial Guaranty 

A. 

Business 

Radian completed the sale of Radian Asset Assurance to Assured on April 1, 2015, pursuant to the Radian Asset Assurance Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of December 22, 2014. Until the April 1, 2015 sale date, the operating results of Radian Asset Assurance were classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Previously, Radian Asset Assurance had represented substantially all of the financial guaranty segment; therefore, as a result of the sale, we no longer report a financial guaranty business segment. 

Radian Asset Assurance provided direct insurance and reinsurance on credit-based structured finance and public finance risks. For additional information related to discontinued operations, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investment Policy and Portfolio 

Our investment portfolio is our primary source of liquidity. 

We follow an investment policy that is applied on a consolidated risk and asset allocation basis and requires, among other things, the following: 

&#8226; 

At least 75% of our investment portfolio, based on market value, must consist of investment securities that are assigned a quality designation of NAIC 1 by the NAIC or equivalent ratings by a NRSRO (i.e., &#8220;A-&#8221; or better by S&#38;P and &#8220;A3&#8221; or better by Moody&#8217;s); 

&#8226; 

A maximum of 15% of our investment portfolio, based on market value, may consist of investment securities that are assigned a quality designation of NAIC 2 by the NAIC or equivalent ratings by a NRSRO (i.e., &#8220;BBB+&#8221; to &#8220;BBB-&#8221; by S&#38;P and &#8220;Baa1&#8221; to &#8220;Baa3&#8221; by Moody&#8217;s); and 

&#8226; 

A maximum of 10% of our investment portfolio, based on market value, may consist of investment securities that are assigned quality designations NAIC 3 through 6 or equivalent ratings by a NRSRO (i.e., &#8220;BB+&#8221; and below by S&#38;P and &#8220;Ba1&#8221; and below by Moody&#8217;s) and other investments not assigned NAIC quality designations (generally equity). 

Our portfolio has been constructed to maximize long-term expected return while maintaining an acceptable risk level. Our investment objectives are to generate tax-efficient income, to preserve capital, and to utilize appropriate risk management. We manage the level of our short-term investments to meet our expected short-term cash requirements. 

Our investment policies and strategies are subject to change, depending on regulatory, economic and market conditions and our then-existing or anticipated financial condition and operating requirements, including our current and future tax positions. The investments held at our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to insurance regulatory requirements applicable to such insurance subsidiaries. 

Oversight responsibility of our investment portfolio rests with management, and allocations are set by periodic asset allocation studies, calibrated by risk and return and after-tax considerations. We manage approximately 16% of the investment portfolio (the portion of the portfolio largely consisting of U.S. Treasury obligations, exchange traded funds and short-term investments) internally, with the remainder primarily managed by three external managers. External managers are selected by management based primarily upon the selected allocations, as well as factors such as historical returns and stability of their management teams. Management&#8217;s selections are presented to and approved by the Finance and Investment Committee of our Board. 

At December 31, 2015 , our investment portfolio had a cost basis of $4.35 billion &#32;and carrying value of $4.30 billion , including $1.11 billion of investments maturing within one year or less. Our investment portfolio did not include any residential real estate or whole mortgage loans at December 31, 2015 . At December 31, 2015 , 97.6% &#32;of our investment portfolio was rated investment grade. For additional information about our investment portfolio, see the information that follows, as well as Notes 5 and 6 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Enterprise Risk Management 

As part of our risk management strategy, we operate a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program. Radian employs more than 50 dedicated risk management professionals and has developed and established credit, portfolio, and counterparty risk policies, enterprise risk management policies, procedures for monitoring compliance with these policies, and comprehensive capabilities and tools to identify, communicate, and mitigate credit and risk-related issues. 

The risks that fall under the program span the entire spectrum of organizational risks and include risks that may not be easily quantifiable or measurable. These include critical risks that fall into our credit, financial, operational, legal &#38; compliance, and strategic risk categories. Our &#32;ERM process is designed to provide executive management with the ability to evaluate the most significant risks &#32;we face and to calibrate the risk mitigation strategies to account for challenges in the current business environment, as well as external factors that may negatively impact our operations. 

Our ERM program takes a holistic approach to managing risks that we face in our business. A cross-functional team, guided by subject matter experts and experienced managers, follows a systematic method to identify, evaluate and monitor risks, both known and emerging. Risk assessments and mitigation plans are developed to address these risks. These assessments and plans are subject to review and modification to account for changes in markets and the regulatory environment, as well as other internal or external factors. 

Our ERM program includes ongoing analysis and ranking of the most significant risks and the alignment of risk management activities with business strategies. We believe that risk scoring &#32;and validation of the effectiveness of risk management plans through management reporting promote accountability for risk management activities throughout the organization. 

Mortgage Insurance Risk Management 

Risk Origination and Servicing. We believe that understanding our business partners and customers is a key component of managing risk. Accordingly, we assign individual risk managers to specific customers so that they can more effectively perform ongoing business-level due diligence. This also allows us to better customize our policies to address individual customers&#8217; strengths and weaknesses. The risk managers are located across the country, and their direct interaction with our customers and their access to local markets improves Radian&#8217;s ability to observe business patterns and manage risk trends. This oversight provides us with the ability to review and study best practices throughout the industry and develop robust data management analysis. 

Portfolio Management. We have developed risk and capital allocation models to support our mortgage insurance business. These models provide robust analysis to establish portfolio limits for product type, loan attributes, geographic concentrations and counterparties. We proactively monitor market concentrations across these attributes. We also identify, evaluate and negotiate potential transactions for terminating insurance risk and for distributing risk to others, including through reinsurance arrangements. See &#8220;Item 1. Business &#8212; Mortgage Insurance &#8212; Risk Management &#8212; Reinsurance &#8212; Ceded&#8221; for more information about the use of reinsurance as a risk management tool in our mortgage insurance business. 

As part of our portfolio management function, we monitor and analyze the performance of various risks in our mortgage portfolio. We use this information to develop our mortgage credit risk and counterparty risk policies, and as a component of our default and prepayment analytics. 

We have a valuation group that analyzes the current composition of our mortgage insurance portfolio and assesses risks to the portfolio from the market (e.g., the effects of changes in home prices and interest rates) and risks from particular lenders, products and geographic locales. 

Credit Policy. We have developed and maintain mortgage-related, credit risk policies. These policies reflect our tolerance levels with respect to accepting risk regarding counterparty, portfolio, operational, and structured risks involving mortgage collateral. Our credit policy team develops and updates our mortgage insurance eligibility and guidelines through regular monitoring of competitor offerings, customer input regarding high-LTV lending needs, analysis of historical performance and portfolio trends, quality assurance results, underwriter experience and observations, and risk tolerances. The credit policy team is also responsible for loan and lender-level exceptions to published guidelines as well as lender corrective action in the event we discover credit performance issues, such as high early payment defaults. The credit policy team works closely with our team of mortgage insurance underwriters to ensure that underwriting decisions align with risk tolerances and principles. 

&#32;37 

Part II Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Quality Assurance. Quality assurance is a key element of our credit analytics function, and as part of our quality control program, we audit individual loan files to examine underwriting decisions for compliance with agreed-upon underwriting guidelines. These audits are conducted across loans submitted through our delegated and non-delegated underwriting channels. Our quality assurance team audits both Radian&#8217;s customers and Radian&#8217;s underwriters to ensure quality in our NIW. Observations and trends derived from our quality assurance process serve as critical inputs into portfolio monitoring, eligibility and guideline updates, and customer surveillance and also provide valuable feedback to our customers and our underwriters regarding the quality of their mortgage insurance underwriting decisions. 

Loss Mitigation. &#32; We have a dedicated loss mitigation group that works with servicers to identify and pursue loss mitigation opportunities for loans in both our performing and non-performing (defaulted) portfolios. This includes regular surveillance and benchmarking of servicer performance with respect to default reporting, borrower retention efforts, foreclosure alternatives and foreclosure processing. Through this process, we seek to hold servicers accountable for their performance and communicate to servicers identified best practices for servicer performance. 

Risk Modeling. We have expertise in the development and deployment of integrated credit and interest rate risk models. Using analytical techniques, we have developed loan level default and prepayment models that can be used for a wide range of risk management applications, including portfolio analysis, credit decision making, forecasting, and reserving, among others.

VII. 

Regulation 

A. 

State Regulation 

We and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation by the insurance departments in the various states where our insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business. Insurance laws vary from state to state, but generally grant broad supervisory powers to agencies or officials to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business. These regulations principally are designed for the protection of policyholders, rather than for the benefit of investors. 

Insurance regulations address, among other things, the licensing of companies to transact business, claims handling, reinsurance requirements, premium rates and policy forms offered to customers, financial statements, periodic reporting, permissible investments and adherence to financial standards relating to surplus, dividends and other measures of solvency intended to assure the satisfaction of obligations to policyholders. 

Our insurance subsidiaries&#8217; premium rates and policy forms are generally subject to regulation in every state in which they are licensed to transact business. These regulations are intended to protect policyholders against the adverse effects of excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates and to encourage competition in the insurance marketplace. In most states where our insurance subsidiaries are licensed, premium rates and policy forms must be filed with the state insurance regulatory authority and, in some states, must be approved before their use. Premium rates may be subject to actuarial justification, generally on the basis of the insurer&#8217;s loss experience, expenses and future projections. In addition, states may consider general default experience in the mortgage insurance industry in assessing the premium rates charged by mortgage insurers. 

Each insurance subsidiary is required by the insurance regulatory authority of its state of domicile, and the insurance regulatory authority of each other jurisdiction in which it is licensed to transact business, to make various filings with those insurance regulatory authorities and with the NAIC, including quarterly and annual financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles. In addition, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to examination by the insurance regulatory authority of their state of domicile, as well as each of the states in which they are licensed to transact business. 

1. 

Our Insurance Subsidiaries 

All of our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in Pennsylvania. 

Effective December 31, 2015, as part of our efforts to create a more efficient organizational structure, we obtained the necessary approvals from the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner to effectuate a reorganization of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, which included a significant redistribution of assets and RIF among our legal entities. As a result of these actions, substantially all of the RIF and assets previously held by certain of our insurance subsidiaries (Radian Guaranty Reinsurance, RMAI, Radian Insurance and Radian Mortgage Insurance) were transferred to Radian Guaranty and a newly formed insurance company, Radian Reinsurance. As a result of this reorganization, the following represent our principal insurance companies as of December 31, 2015: 

&#8226; 

Radian Guaranty . &#160; Radian Guaranty is our primary mortgage insurance company. Radian Guaranty is our only mortgage insurance company that is eligible to insure GSE loans. It is a monoline insurer, restricted to writing only residential mortgage guaranty insurance. In addition to Pennsylvania, Radian Guaranty is authorized to write mortgage guaranty insurance (or in states where there is no specific authorization for mortgage guaranty insurance, the applicable line of insurance under which mortgage guaranty insurance is regulated) in each of the other 49 states, the District of Columbia and Guam. Radian Guaranty is a direct subsidiary of Radian Group. 

&#8226; 

Radian Reinsurance. &#32;Radian Reinsurance is our exclusive affiliated reinsurer that is eligible to provide affiliate reinsurance to Radian Guaranty. Radian Reinsurance is a direct subsidiary of Radian Group. 

&#8226; 

Radian Insurance . Radian Insurance is our insurance subsidiary that is authorized in Hong Kong to insure our remaining Hong Kong insurance portfolio and also insures our other remaining non-traditional risk. Radian Insurance is a direct subsidiary of Radian Guaranty. 

In addition, we have the following insurance subsidiaries, each of which had no risk as of December 31, 2015: Radian Investor Surety Inc.; Radian Mortgage Guaranty; Radian Guaranty Reinsurance; Radian Mortgage Insurance and RMAI. 

&#32;39 

Part I Item 1. Business 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

2. 

Insurance Holding Company Regulation 

Radian Group is an insurance holding company and our insurance subsidiaries belong to an insurance holding company system. All states regulate insurance holding company systems, including the non-insurer holding company within that system. These laws generally require each insurance subsidiary within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its domiciliary state, and to furnish to the regulators in these states applicable financial statements, statements related to intercompany transactions and other information concerning the holding company and its affiliated companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of insurers or the holding company system. 

Radian Group is considered an insurance holding company and, because all of our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in Pennsylvania, the insurance holding company laws of Pennsylvania regulate, among other things, certain transactions between Radian Group, our insurance subsidiaries and other parties affiliated with us. The holding company laws of Pennsylvania also govern certain transactions involving Radian Group&#8217;s common stock, including transactions that constitute a &#8220;change of control&#8221; of Radian Group and, consequently, a &#8220;change of control&#8221; of our insurance subsidiaries. Specifically, no person may, directly or indirectly, seek to acquire &#8220;control&#8221; of Radian Group or any of its insurance subsidiaries unless that person files a statement and other documents with the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner and the commissioner&#8217;s prior approval is obtained. Under Pennsylvania&#8217;s insurance statutes, &#8220;control&#8221; is defined broadly and is &#8220;presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with power to vote or holds proxies representing ten percent (10%) or more of the voting securities&#8221; of a holding company of a Pennsylvania domestic insurer. The statute further defines &#8220;control&#8221; as the &#8220;possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of&#8221; an insurer. 

In addition, material transactions between us or our affiliates and our insurance subsidiaries or among our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain conditions, including that they be &#8220;fair and reasonable.&#8221; These conditions generally apply to all persons controlling, or who are under common control with, us or our insurance subsidiaries. Certain transactions between us or our affiliates and our insurance subsidiaries may not be entered into unless the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner is given 30 days&#8217; prior notification and does not disapprove the transaction during that 30-day period. 

Pennsylvania also requires that we identify the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the insurer. Pennsylvania has adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Act, which was effective January 1, 2015 and requires, among other things, that Pennsylvania-domiciled insurers maintain a risk management framework and conduct an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (&#8220;ORSA&#8221;) annually in accordance with applicable NAIC requirements. 

3. 

Dividends 

Under Pennsylvania&#8217;s insurance laws, dividends and other distributions may only be paid out of an insurer&#8217;s positive unassigned surplus, measured as of the end of the prior fiscal year, unless the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner approves the payment of dividends or other distributions from another source. While all proposed dividends and distributions to shareholders must be filed with the Pennsylvania Insurance Department prior to payment, if a Pennsylvania domiciled insurer had positive unassigned surplus as of the end of the prior fiscal year, then unless the prior approval of the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner is obtained, such insurer could only pay dividends or other distributions during any 12-month period in an aggregate amount less than or equal to the greater of: (i) 10% of the preceding year-end statutory policyholders&#8217; surplus; or (ii) the preceding year&#8217;s statutory net income. 

Radian Guaranty had negative unassigned surplus at December 31, 2015 of $679.9 million &#32;and therefore no dividends or other distributions can be paid from Radian Guaranty in 2016 without approval from the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner. Due in part to the need to set aside contingency reserves as discussed below, we do not expect that Radian Guaranty will have positive unassigned surplus and therefore, will not have the ability to pay ordinary dividends for the foreseeable future. Neither Radian Guaranty nor Radian Reinsurance paid any dividends in 2015 or 2014. 

All of our other insurance subsidiaries had negative unassigned surplus at December 31, 2015 (except Radian Mortgage Guaranty, which had an immaterial amount of positive unassigned surplus). Therefore, no dividends or other distributions can be paid by these subsidiaries in 2016 without approval from the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner. 

In 2015, in connection with the reorganization of our insurance subsidiaries discussed above, the Pennsylvania Insurance Department authorized Radian Insurance, RMAI, Radian Mortgage Insurance, RGRI and Radian Investor Surety Inc. to pay extraordinary dividends. None of the distributions from these entities were retained by Radian Group, as all proceeds were distributed to either Radian Guaranty or Radian Reinsurance. 

&#32;40 

Part I Item 1. Business 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

4. 

Risk-to-Capital 

Under state insurance regulations, Radian Guaranty is required to maintain minimum surplus levels and, in certain states, a minimum ratio of statutory capital relative to the level of net RIF, or Risk-to-capital. Sixteen states currently impose a Statutory RBC Requirement. The most common Statutory RBC Requirement is that a mortgage insurer&#8217;s Risk-to-capital may not exceed 25 to 1. In certain of the RBC States, Radian Guaranty must satisfy a MPP Requirement. The statutory capital requirements for the non-RBC States are de minimis (ranging from $1 million to $5 million); however, the insurance laws of these states generally grant broad supervisory powers to state agencies or officials to enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of insurance business, including the power to revoke or restrict an insurance company&#8217;s ability to write new business. Unless an RBC State grants a waiver or other form of relief, if a mortgage insurer such as Radian Guaranty is not in compliance with the Statutory RBC Requirement of such state, it may be prohibited from writing new mortgage insurance business in that state. Radian Guaranty&#8217;s domiciliary state, Pennsylvania, is not one of the RBC States. In 2015 and 2014, the RBC States accounted for approximately 55.8% &#32;and 56.3% , respectively, of Radian Guaranty&#8217;s total primary NIW. As of December 31, 2015, Radian Guaranty&#8217;s Risk-to-capital was 14.3 &#32;to 1, and Radian Guaranty was in compliance with all applicable Statutory RBC Requirements. 

The NAIC is in the process of reviewing the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers and considering changes to the Model Act. While the outcome of this process is not known, it is possible that among other changes, the NAIC will recommend and adopt more stringent capital requirements that could increase the capital requirements for Radian Guaranty in states that adopt the new Model Act. While we cannot provide any assurance, we do not believe that the capital requirements that may be adopted under the new Model Act are likely to exceed those of the PMIERs. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive state insurance regulations and other requirements, which we may fail to satisfy. &#32; 

5. 

Contingency Reserves 

For statutory reporting, mortgage insurance companies are required annually to set aside contingency reserves in an amount equal to 50% of earned premiums. Such amounts cannot be released into surplus for a period of 10 years, except when loss ratios exceed 35%, in which case the amount above 35% can be released under certain circumstances. The contingency reserve, which is designed to be a reserve against catastrophic losses, essentially restricts dividends and other distributions by mortgage insurance companies. We classify the contingency reserves of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries as a statutory liability. At December 31, 2015, Radian Guaranty and Radian Reinsurance had contingency reserves of $860.9 million , and $128.8 million , respectively. 

6. 

Reinsurance 

Certain states limit the amount of risk a mortgage insurer may retain on a single loan to 25% of the total loan amount. Coverage in excess of 25% (i.e., deep coverage) must be reinsured. 

7. 

Our Services Business - Real Estate, Title and Appraisal Management Licensing 

Our Services subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight by the states where they conduct their businesses, including requirements to be licensed and/or registered in the states in which they conduct operations. Red Bell and its affiliates provide real estate brokerage services in each of the fifty states and the District of Columbia, and they and their designated brokers are required to hold licenses and conduct their brokerage business in conformity with the applicable license laws and administrative regulations of the states in which they are conducting their business. 

ValuAmerica and its affiliates provide title services and serve as an appraisal management company in a number of states, and are required to hold the required licenses in the jurisdictions where they operate their business. ValuAmerica is domiciled and licensed in Pennsylvania as a resident title insurance agency and licensed as a non-resident title insurance agency in a number of other states. Title insurance agency licensing is primarily regulated by states in which the services are being offered with licensing and registration typically within the jurisdiction of each State Department of Insurance. 

Our valuation subsidiaries are also subject to comprehensive oversight by the states in which they operate. Real estate appraisal management statutes and regulations vary from state to state, but generally grant broad supervisory powers to agencies or officials to examine companies and enforce rules. While these businesses are generally state regulated, the Dodd-Frank Act established minimum requirements to be implemented by states regarding the registration and supervision of appraisal management companies. Most states have based their legislation on model legislation developed by the Appraisal Institute for the registration and oversight of appraisal management companies.

Part I Item 1. Business

B. 

GSE Requirements 

As the largest purchasers of conventional mortgage loans, and therefore, the main beneficiaries of private mortgage insurance, the GSEs impose eligibility requirements that private mortgage insurers must satisfy in order to be approved to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. 

PMIERs - &#32;Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements. In order to be eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs, mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty must meet the GSEs&#8217; eligibility requirements, or PMIERs. The GSEs recently revised the PMIERs, effective December 31, 2015, with the aim of ensuring that approved insurers will possess the financial and operational capacity to serve as strong counterparties to the GSEs throughout various market conditions. The PMIERs are comprehensive, covering virtually all aspects of the business and operations of a private mortgage insurer, including internal risk management and quality controls, the relationship between the GSEs and the approved insurer and the approved insurer&#8217;s financial condition. The GSEs have significant discretion under the PMIERs as well as a broad range of consent rights to approve various actions of the approved insurer. The GSEs may amend the PMIERs at any time in their sole discretion. 

The PMIERs Financial Requirements require that a mortgage insurer&#8217;s Available Assets (as defined, these primarily include liquid assets and exclude premiums received but not yet earned) meet or exceed its Minimum Required Assets (a risk-based minimum required asset amount calculated based on net RIF, and which is intended to approximate the maximum loss exposure based on a variety of criteria designed to evaluate credit quality). Under the PMIERs, Radian Guaranty&#8217;s Available Assets and Minimum Required Assets are determined on an aggregate basis, taking into account the assets and insured risk of Radian Guaranty and its affiliated reinsurers. Therefore, developments that impact the assets and insured risk of Radian Guaranty&#8217;s affiliated reinsurers (such as capital contributions from Radian Group) also will impact the aggregate Available Assets and Minimum Required Assets, and importantly, Radian Guaranty&#8217;s compliance with the PMIERs Financial Requirements. In comparison to the prior GSE eligibility requirements, the PMIERs Financial Requirements include more stringent financial requirements for defaulted loans, as well as loans with a higher likelihood of default and/or certain credit characteristics, such as higher LTVs and lower FICO scores, and for loans originated after January 1, 2016 that are insured under lender-paid mortgage insurance policies not subject to automatic termination under the HPA. Therefore, if our mix of business includes a higher percentage of loans that are subject to these increased financial requirements, it would increase the Minimum Required Assets and/or the amount of Available Assets that Radian Guaranty is required to hold. 

The PMIERs provide that the factors that are applied to calculate and determine a mortgage insurer&#8217;s Minimum Required Assets will be updated every two years or more frequently, as determined by the GSEs, to reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions or loan performance. As a result, there is some ongoing uncertainty regarding the amount of capital that private mortgage insurers, including Radian Guaranty, may require in the future in order to remain compliant with the PMIERs Financial Requirements. 

The PMIERs contain extensive requirements related to the conduct and operations of our mortgage insurance business, including stringent operational requirements in areas such as claim processing, loss mitigation, document retention, underwriting, quality control, reporting and monitoring, among others. In addition, the PMIERs require private mortgage insurers to obtain the prior consent of both GSEs before taking certain actions such as paying dividends, entering into various inter-company agreements and commuting or reinsuring risk, among others. 

Radian Guaranty currently is in compliance with the PMIERs. If Radian Guaranty is not able to comply with the PMIERs in the future, it could lose its eligibility with the GSEs. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs. &#8221; 

Other GSE Business Practices and Requirements. The GSEs acting independently or through their conservator, the FHFA, have the ability to change their business practices and requirements in ways that impact our business. Recent examples of changes in the GSEs&#8217; business practices and requirements that have impacted our business are: 

&#8226; 

implementation of new minimum requirements for master insurance policies for loans the GSEs acquire that include, among other requirements, specific standards for loss mitigation and claims processing activities; and 

&#8226;

The GSEs previously had discontinued programs to acquire loans with LTV ratios at or above 97%. However, in December 2014, the GSEs announced new lending guidelines that enable them to acquire loans with LTV ratios of 97% that include a requirement for private mortgage insurance, for certain qualifying borrowers. In April 2015, the FHFA directed the GSEs to modify their guarantee fee pricing. Among others, the changes to the guarantee fee included: (i) eliminating the adverse market charge that had been in place since 2008; and (ii) increasing the upfront fees by 25 basis points for loans with terms exceeding 15 years that have both an LTV ratio of 80 percent or less and credit-score of 700 or more. To date, the results of these most recent changes in the GSEs&#8217; fees have not had a significant impact on the competitiveness of our pricing in relation to the FHA&#8217;s pricing. 

See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; Changes in the charters, business practices, or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, could significantly impact our mortgage insurance business. &#8221;

Federal Regulation 

1. 

Housing Finance Reform 

Presently, the federal government plays a significant role in the U.S. housing finance system through, among other things, the involvement of the FHFA and GSEs, the FHA and the VA. There has been ongoing debate about the roles that the federal government and private capital should play in the housing finance system, and in recent years, there generally has been broad policy consensus that there is a need to increase the role of private capital. 

Since FHFA was appointed as conservator of the GSEs in September 2008, there has been a wide range of legislative proposals to reform the U.S. housing finance market, including proposals for GSE reform ranging from some that advocate nearly complete privatization and elimination of the role of the GSEs to others that support a system that combines a federal role with private capital. The placement of the GSEs into the conservatorship of the FHFA increases the likelihood that Congress will address the role and purpose of the GSEs in the U.S. housing finance market. Further, Freddie Mac declared a net loss in the third quarter of 2015, which raises the possibility of a need for further U.S. government assistance in the future. This development potentially could accelerate efforts to reform the GSEs and the housing finance system in the U.S. It remains unclear whether housing finance reform legislation will be adopted, and if so, what form it may ultimately take. 

In the absence of comprehensive legislation, the FHFA has made changes to the business and operations of the GSEs. As a mechanism for implementing changes, the FHFA most commonly uses the annual process of releasing a strategic plan for conservatorship and setting goals for the GSEs (the &#8220;Scorecard&#8221;) to meet as part of their on-going regulation. The 2016 Scorecard includes deadlines for the development of a single security in the next three years, a possible change to the appraisal oversight function, exploring options for the creation of a new streamlined refinance program to replace HARP and HAMP upon their expiration, and an increase of the mandate for the GSEs to transfer credit risk, also known as &#8220;credit risk transfer.&#8221; 

The mandate for increased credit risk transfer builds upon the goals set in each of the last three years for the GSEs to transfer portions of their mortgage credit risk to the private sector by experimenting with different forms of transactions and structures. In 2016, the GSEs are directed to conduct an analysis and assessment of risk transfer transactions at the time of initial risk-taking (i.e., &#8220;front-end&#8221;). If any of these credit risk transfer transactions displace primary, standard levels of mortgage insurance, the amount of insurance we write may be reduced. There is, however, also the opportunity for these transactions to include additional mortgage insurance in excess of standard coverage amounts through a concept known as &#8220;deeper cover MI,&#8221; which could increase the amount of insurance we write. As a result, it is difficult to predict the impact of any credit risk transfer products and transactions implemented by the GSEs. 

See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; Changes in the charters, business practices, or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, could significantly impact our mortgage insurance business. &#8221; and &#32;&#8220;&#8212; Our mortgage insurance business faces intense competition. &#8221; 

2. 

FHA 

Private mortgage insurance competes with the single-family mortgage insurance programs of the FHA. As such, the FHA is one of our biggest competitors. We compete on the basis of loan limits, pricing and credit guidelines. Since the financial crisis, the loan limits for FHA-insured loans and the loan limits for GSE conforming loans have been substantially the same, as is the case presently. It is possible that, in the future, Congress could impose different loan limits for FHA loans than for GSE conforming loans as it has done in the past, which could impact the competitiveness of private mortgage insurance in relation to FHA programs. 

&#32;43 

Part I Item 1. Business 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Beginning in 2008, the FHA, which historically had not been a significant competitor, substantially increased its market share of the insured mortgage market. Since then, the private mortgage insurance industry generally had been recapturing market share from the FHA, due to, among other factors, improvements in the financial strength of private mortgage insurers, increases in the FHA&#8217;s pricing and various policy changes at the FHA, such as the general elimination of a policy that provided for the cancellation of premium payments after the unpaid principal balance, excluding the upfront premium, reaches 78% of the lower of the initial sales price or initial appraised value, as well as more aggressive loss mitigation actions. In January 2015, the FHA reduced its annual mortgage insurance premium by 50 basis points for loans entering the origination process on or after January 26, 2015, including refinancings. The FHA&#8217;s upfront mortgage insurance premium was not changed. This recent FHA price reduction has impacted the competitiveness of private mortgage insurance with respect to certain high-LTV loans to borrowers with FICO scores below 720. As a result, the FHA&#8217;s share of the insured market has increased in 2015. 

In November 2015, HUD released its annual report to Congress on the financial condition of the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, which found that the FHA&#8217;s single family mortgage and reverse mortgage insurance programs had recovered and now exceeded its minimum capitalization threshold for the first time since 2011. This development may put pressure on the FHA to further reduce premiums or implement changes to its current non-cancellation policy or other policies. Reductions in the FHA&#8217;s annual premiums or changes to its policies may further impact our competitiveness with the FHA. 

Congress has been considering FHA reform in addition to GSE reform. Given that FHA and GSE reform have significant impacts on each other, as well as on borrower access to credit and the housing market more broadly, policymakers may consider both GSE reform and FHA reform together. While it is unclear whether FHA reform legislation will be adopted and, if so, what provisions it might ultimately contain, if legislative changes to the FHA and GSEs are not made contemporaneously, there is a possibility that the relative competitiveness of private mortgage insurance could be disadvantaged. 

3. 

The Dodd-Frank Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act mandates significant rulemaking by several regulatory agencies to implement its provisions. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products and services, including residential mortgages, under federal law and transferred authority to the CFPB to enforce many existing consumer related federal laws, including TILA and RESPA. Among the most significant provisions for private mortgage insurers under the Dodd-Frank Act are the ability to repay mortgage provisions (&#8220;Ability to Repay Rule&#8221;), the securitization risk retention provisions and the expanded mortgage servicing requirements under TILA and RESPA. 

Qualified Mortgage Requirements - Ability to Repay Requirements. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, Ability to Repay Rule, mortgage lenders are required to make a reasonable and good faith determination that, at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan. The Dodd-Frank Act provides that a creditor may presume that a borrower will be able to repay a loan if the loan has certain low-risk characteristics that meet the definition of a qualified mortgage or &#8220;QM.&#8221; 

The CFPB established rigorous underwriting and product feature requirements for the loans to be deemed QM. Within those regulations, the CFPB created a special exemption for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for a period ending upon the earlier of the end of conservatorship or January 10, 2021, which allows any loan that meets the GSE underwriting and product guidelines to be a QM. The CFPB regulations became effective in January 2014. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also granted the FHA, VA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;) flexibility to establish their own definitions of QM for their insurance guaranty programs. Both the FHA and VA have created their own definition of QM that differ from both the CFPB&#8217;s definition and the current underwriting and product guidelines at the GSEs that are subject to the special exemption. To the extent these alternate definitions of QM are more favorable to lenders and mortgage holders than the CFPB QM Rule that applies to the GSEs and the markets in which we operate, it could further drive business to these agencies and have a negative impact on our mortgage insurance business. 

Qualified Residential Mortgage Regulations - Securitization Risk Retention Requirements. &#32;The Dodd-Frank Act requires securitizers to retain at least 5% of the credit risk associated with mortgage loans that they transfer, sell or convey, unless the mortgage loans are qualified residential mortgages (&#8220;QRMs&#8221;) or are insured by the FHA or another federal agency. Under applicable federal regulations, a QRM is generally defined as a mortgage meeting the requirements of a qualified mortgage under the CFPB&#8217;s QM rule described above. Because of the capital support provided by the U.S. government to the GSEs, the GSEs satisfy the proposed risk retention requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act while they are in conservatorship, so sellers of loans to the GSEs will not be subject to the risk retention requirements referenced above. This means that securitizers would not be required to retain risk under the final QRM rule on loans that are guaranteed by the GSEs while in conservatorship. The final rule requires the agencies that implemented the rule to review the QRM definition no later than four years after its effective date and every five years thereafter, and allows each agency to request a review of the definition at any time. 

&#32;44 

Part I Item 1. Business 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Mortgage Servicing Rules. The Dodd-Frank Act amended and expanded upon mortgage servicing requirements under TILA and RESPA. The CFPB was required to amend Regulation Z (promulgated under TILA) and Regulation X (promulgated under RESPA) to conform these regulations to the new statutory requirements. The final rules implementing these expanded and detailed mortgage servicing requirements became effective in January 2014. Among other things, the rules include new or enhanced requirements for handling loans that are in default. Since 2014, the CFPB has clarified those rules through subsequent rulemakings and provided guidance on how servicers must apply them in certain circumstances. The CFPB is expected to finalize its latest rulemaking in the summer of 2016. Complying with the mortgage servicing rules has been challenging and costly for many loan servicers. Among its products and services, our Services business provides services to financial institutions that are focused on evaluating compliance with and establishing processes and procedures to implement compliance with national and state servicing standards, including the CFPB&#8217;s mortgage servicing regulations. 

Other. In addition to the foregoing, the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Treasury. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office performs various functions with respect to insurance, such as serving as a non-voting member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. In December 2013, the Federal Insurance Office published a study on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the U.S., which recommended the development and implementation of federal oversight for private mortgage insurers. In its 2015 annual report to Congress, the Federal Insurance Office again recommended federal enforcement of federal standards for the mortgage insurance industry. To the extent these recommendations are acted upon by legislators or other executive action, a divergence from the current system of state regulation could significantly change compliance burdens and possibly impact our financial condition. 

4. 

RESPA 

Settlement service providers in connection with the origination or refinance of a federally regulated mortgage loan are subject to RESPA. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the authority to implement and enforce RESPA was transferred to the CFPB. RESPA authorizes the CFPB, the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general and state insurance commissioners to bring civil enforcement actions, and also provides for criminal penalties and private rights of action. 

Mortgage insurance is considered to be a settlement service for purposes of RESPA under applicable regulations. As a result, mortgage insurers are subject to the anti-referral fee provisions of Section 8 of RESPA which, among other things, generally provide that mortgage insurers are prohibited from paying or accepting anything of value in connection with the referral of a settlement service. Our acquisition of Clayton in 2014 has enhanced the suite of both settlement and non-settlement services available to our customers, including real estate, valuation, appraisal, title and closing services through Clayton&#8217;s Red Bell and ValuAmerica subsidiaries. To the extent any of these services are settlement services for purposes of RESPA, the &#8220;anti-referral fee&#8221; and &#8220;anti-kickback&#8221; provisions of Section 8 of RESPA may apply and it could impact how these services are marketed and sold individually or together with the mortgage insurance we offer. 

In the past, we and other mortgage insurers have faced lawsuits alleging, among other things, that our captive reinsurance arrangements constituted unlawful payments to mortgage lenders under RESPA. Several of these lawsuits were dismissed and in March 2015 we entered into a settlement agreement relating to the remaining lawsuits, pursuant to which the plaintiffs agreed to voluntarily dismiss their claims with prejudice and to fully release Radian Guaranty from any future claims related to the claims in these lawsuits. We also have been subject to lawsuits alleging that our pool insurance and contract underwriting services violated RESPA. In addition, we and other mortgage insurers have been subject to inquiries and investigative demands from state and federal governmental agencies, including the CFPB, requesting information relating to captive reinsurance. In April 2013, we reached a settlement with the CFPB that concluded its investigation with respect to Radian Guaranty without any findings of wrongdoing. As part of the settlement, Radian Guaranty paid a civil penalty and agreed that it would not enter into any new captive reinsurance agreement or reinsure any new loans under any existing captive reinsurance agreement for a period of ten years. In June 2015, Radian Guaranty executed a Consent Order with the Minnesota Department of Commerce that resolved the Minnesota Department of Commerce&#8217;s outstanding inquiries related to captive reinsurance arrangements involving mortgage insurance in Minnesota without any findings of wrongdoing. As part of the Consent Order, Radian Guaranty paid a civil penalty and agreed not to enter into new captive reinsurance arrangements for a period of ten years ending in June 2025. We have not entered into any new captive reinsurance arrangements since 2007.

Part I Item 1. Business 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

The CFPB amended Regulations X and Z to establish significant new disclosure requirements and forms in Regulation Z for most closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property through a regulation known as the &#8220;TILA RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) rule&#8221; or the &#8220;Know Before You Owe&#8221; (KBYO) Mortgage Disclosures that became effective October 3, 2015. The TRID rule mandates that a series of enhanced disclosures be provided to consumers in connection with the origination of most types of residential mortgage loans. Early public reports indicate that some lenders and their service partners have had difficulties implementing this new disclosure regime, which has resulted in delays in closing loans. In addition, difficulties implementing the new disclosure requirements may result in possible liability for lenders and purchasers. Consequently, the slowdown in the volume of newly originated loans as a result of the implementation of the TRID/KBYO rule has had a negative impact on the residential mortgage market, including the number of transactions available for the loan review and due diligence services offered by our Services segment. However, the need to determine whether loans comply with the strict requirements in the TRID/KBYO rule, many of which are highly technical, may increase the demand for these services in the future. 

5. 

Homeowner Assistance Programs 

The Emergency Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 (&#8220;EESA&#8221;) included provisions that require the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury (&#8220;Treasury Secretary&#8221;) to encourage further use of the Hope for Homeowners program. Under EESA, the Treasury Secretary is required to &#8220;maximize assistance to homeowners and encourage mortgage servicers to take advantage of available programs (including the Hope for Homeowners program) to minimize foreclosures.&#8221; In 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan to restructure or refinance mortgages to avoid foreclosures through: (i) refinancing mortgage loans through HARP; (ii) modifying first- and Second-lien mortgage loans through HAMP and the Second Lien Modification Program; and (iii) offering other alternatives to foreclosure through the Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives Program (&#8220;HAFA&#8221;). Details of these programs are as follows: 

&#8226; 

In 2009, the GSEs began offering the HARP program, which allows a borrower who is not delinquent to refinance his or her mortgage to a more stable or affordable loan if such borrower has been unable to take advantage of lower interest rates because his or her home has decreased in value. The HARP program, as subsequently modified by the HARP 2 program, was extended to December 31, 2015, for loans that were originated or acquired by the GSEs by or before May 30, 2009. Under recently adopted legislation, the program was further extended and now will terminate by December 31, 2016. The FHFA and the GSEs are exploring options to replace HARP 2 with an on-going refinance program. In February 2009, the U.S. Treasury established HAMP as a program to modify certain loans to make them more affordable to borrowers, with the goal of reducing the number of foreclosures. Under HAMP, an eligible borrower&#8217;s monthly payments may be lowered by lowering interest rates, extending the term of the mortgage or deferring principal. The HAMP program was extended to December 31, 2016, and cannot be extended without new legislation. 

&#8226; 

HAFA, which became effective in April 2010, is intended to provide additional alternatives to foreclosures by providing incentives to encourage a borrower and servicer to agree that: (i) a borrower can sell his or her home for less than the full amount due on the mortgage and fully satisfy the mortgage; or (ii) a borrower can voluntarily transfer ownership of his or her home to the servicer in full satisfaction of the mortgage. Loans that are eligible for this program must have been originated prior to January 1, 2009. The program is available through participating lenders through December 31, 2016. 

&#8226; 

The U.S. Treasury also has developed uniform guidance for loan modifications to be used by participating servicers in the private sector. The GSEs have incorporated material aspects of these guidelines for loans that they own and loans backing securities that they guarantee. 

See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; Foreclosure prevention and borrower relief programs may not continue to provide us with a material benefit. &#8221; 

6. 

The SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act (&#8220;SAFE Act&#8221;) 

The SAFE Act requires mortgage loan originators to be licensed and/or registered with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry (the &#8220;Registry&#8221;). The Registry is a database established by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators. Among other things, the database was established to support the licensing of mortgage loan originators by each state. As part of this licensing and registration process, loan originators who are employees of institutions other than depository institutions or certain of their subsidiaries that, in each case, are regulated by a federal banking agency, must generally be licensed under the SAFE Act guidelines enacted by each state in which they engage in loan originator activities and registered with the Registry. The entity and its employees that provide our contract underwriting services are compliant with the SAFE Act in 49 states.

Mortgage Insurance Cancellation 

The HPA imposes certain cancellation and termination requirements for borrower-paid private mortgage insurance and requires certain disclosures to borrowers regarding their rights under the law. The HPA also requires certain disclosures for loans covered by lender-paid private mortgage insurance. Specifically, the HPA provides that private mortgage insurance on most loans originated on or after July 29, 1999 may be cancelled at the request of the borrower once the LTV reaches 80% of the original unpaid principal balance, provided that certain conditions are satisfied. Under HPA, private mortgage insurance must be canceled automatically once the LTV reaches 78% of the unpaid principal balance (or, if the loan is not current on that date, on the date that the loan becomes current). 

The HPA establishes special rules for the termination of private mortgage insurance in connection with loans that are &#8220;high risk.&#8221; The HPA does not define &#8220;high risk&#8221; loans, but leaves that determination to the GSEs for loans up to the GSE conforming loan limits and to lenders for any other loan. For &#8220;high risk&#8221; loans above the GSE conforming loan limits, private mortgage insurance must be terminated on the date that the LTV is first scheduled to reach 77% of the unpaid principal balance. In no case, however, may private mortgage insurance be required beyond the midpoint of the amortization period of the loan if the borrower is current on the payments required by the terms of the mortgage. 

8. 

The Fair Credit Reporting Act 

The FCRA, as amended, imposes restrictions on the permissible use of credit report information. FCRA has been interpreted by some FTC staff to require mortgage insurance companies to provide &#8220;adverse action&#8221; notices to consumers in the event an application for mortgage insurance is declined on the basis of a review of the consumer&#8217;s credit. 

9. 

Privacy and Information Security - Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the &#8220;GLBA&#8221;) and State Law 

As part of our business, we, and certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates, maintain large amounts of confidential information, including non-public personal information on consumers and our employees. We and our customers are subject to a variety of privacy and information security laws and regulations. The GLBA imposes privacy requirements on financial institutions, including obligations to protect and safeguard consumers&#8217; nonpublic personal information and records, and limitations on the re-use of such information. GLBA is enforced by state insurance regulators and by federal regulatory agencies. In addition, many states have enacted privacy and data security laws that impose compliance obligations beyond GLBA, including obligations to provide notification in the event that a security breach results in a reasonable belief that unauthorized persons may have obtained access to consumer nonpublic personal information 

10. 

Asset Backed Securitizations 

Our Services business provides services to issuers of and investors in asset backed securitizations and similar transactions. As a result, regulations impacting the asset backed securitization market may impact our Services business directly, or indirectly through the regulation of our Services customers. 

In August 2014, the SEC adopted final rules under Regulation AB that substantially revise the offering process, disclosure and reporting requirements for offerings of ABS. The final Regulation AB II rules implement several key areas of reform. Specifically, Regulation AB II introduces several new requirements related to public offerings of ABS, including the following that are significant for our Services business: 

&#8226; 

New asset-level disclosure requirements for ABS backed by residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans, automobile loans or leases, re-securitizations of ABS backed by any of those asset types, and debt securities; and 

&#8226; 

A requirement that the transaction documents provide for the appointment of an &#8220;asset representations manager&#8221; to review the pool assets when certain trigger events occur. 

Issuers of publicly offered ABS must comply with Regulation AB II&#8217;s new rules, forms and disclosures no later than November 23, 2015, except for the asset-level disclosure requirements which become applicable on November 23, 2016.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

In August 2014, the SEC also adopted its final credit rating agency reform rules. These rules became effective June 15, 2015. The new NRSRO rules include, among other things, new rules and forms that apply to providers of third-party due diligence services (such as our Services business) for both publicly and privately issued Exchange Act-ABS (which includes CLOs, CDOs and synthetic securitizations). The new NRSRO rules require any issuer or underwriter of registered or unregistered ABS that are to be rated by a NRSRO, to furnish a form filed on the SEC&#8217;s EDGAR system that describes the findings and conclusions of any third-party due diligence report obtained by the issuer or underwriter. The rule also requires that a due diligence firm (such as our Services business) that is engaged to perform services in connection with any rated ABS issuance furnish a form that describes the scope of due diligence services performed and a summary of their findings and conclusions. The form is required to be posted on the ABS issuer&#8217;s password-protected website that is required under Rule 17g-5 of the Exchange Act. 

11. 

FDCPA 

The FDCPA prohibits third party debt collectors from using abusive, unfair or deceptive practices to collect a debt. The FDCPA is enforced by the FTC. For purposes of the FDCPA, a debt collector is a person who regularly collects or attempts to collect consumer debts for another person or institution. The FDCPA specifies, among other things, the times and places where a debt collector may communicate with the consumer and which third parties a debt collector may contact other than the consumer, as well as the ways in which such communication may be conducted. Failure to comply with the FDCPA may result in liability for actual damages, punitive damages and other costs and fees, all as set forth in the FDCPA. 

Certain of our Services business activities involve direct communications with consumers who have defaulted on mortgage loans, primarily to determine their desire to explore their options with the loan servicer or investor, and to make these introductions, as necessary. These consumer-related interactions may be construed to constitute debt collection activities within the meaning of the FDCPA. 

12. 

Mortgage Insurance Tax Deduction 

In December 2015, Congress once again temporarily extended the tax deduction available to certain individuals, subject to income limitations, for the payment of mortgage insurance premiums. Under that legislation, the deduction is allowable for filers for the 2015 and 2016 tax years. There are pending legislative efforts to make this tax deduction a permanent part of the Internal Revenue Code, but to date have not been enacted. Further extension or permanence would assist private mortgage insurance in its competition with simultaneous second loans that are designed to avoid the use of private mortgage insurance. It is difficult to predict whether the deduction will be further extended in the future or if legislation to make the deduction permanent will become law. 

D. 

Basel III 

Over the past few decades, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has established international benchmarks for assessing banks&#8217; capital adequacy requirements. Included within those benchmarks are capital standards related to the residential lending and securitization activity and importantly for private mortgage insurers, the treatment of mortgage insurance on those loans. These benchmarks are then interpreted and implemented via rulemaking by U.S. banking regulators. 

In July 2013, U.S. banking regulators promulgated regulations to implement significant elements of the Basel framework, referred to as &#8220;Basel III.&#8221; In that rulemaking, there is a five year phase-in period that started tolling in January 2014. Today, the current capital regime under Basel III for U.S. banks assigns a 50% or 100% risk weight to one- to four-unit residential mortgage exposures. Generally, residential mortgage exposures that are prudently underwritten and performing receive a 50% risk weight, while all other residential mortgage exposures are assigned a 100% risk weight. In March 2015, the U.S. banking regulators clarified that LTV ratios can account for credit enhancement such as private mortgage insurance in determining whether a loan is made in accordance with prudent underwriting standards for purposes of receiving the preferred 50% risk weight. 

In December 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a proposal for further revisions to Basel III. It proposed adjustments to the risk weights for residential mortgage exposures that take into account LTV and the borrower&#8217;s ability to service a mortgage as a proxy for a debt service coverage ratio. The proposed LTV ratio did not take into consideration any credit enhancement, including private mortgage insurance. Comments closed on the 2014 proposal in March 2015, and in December 2015, the Basel Committee released a second proposal that retained the LTV provisions of the initial draft, but not the debt servicing coverage ratios. The 2015 proposal remains open for comment until March 11, 2016.

Part I Item 1. Business 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Following consideration of the comments received, it is possible that newly revised risk weighting guidelines from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision may be proposed and that the U.S. banking regulators may consider changes to the existing rules. It is unclear whether new guidelines will be proposed or finalized. 

See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; The implementation of the Basel III guidelines may discourage the use of mortgage insurance. &#8221;

Foreign Regulation 

By reason of Radian Insurance&#8217;s authorization, in September 2006, to conduct insurance business through a branch in Hong Kong, we are subject to regulation by the Hong Kong Insurance Authority (&#8220;HKIA&#8221;). The HKIA&#8217;s principal purpose is to supervise and regulate the insurance industry, primarily for the protection of policyholders and the stability of the industry. Hong Kong insurers are required by the Insurance Companies Ordinance to maintain minimum capital as well as an excess of assets over liabilities of not less than a required solvency margin, which is determined on the basis of a statutory formula. Foreign-owned insurers are also required to maintain assets in Hong Kong in an amount sufficient to ensure that assets will be available in Hong Kong to meet the claims of Hong Kong policyholders if the insurer should become insolvent. The HKIA also reviews the backgrounds and qualifications of insurance companies&#8217; directors and key local management to ensure that these &#8220;controllers&#8221; are &#8220;fit and proper&#8221; to hold their positions and has the authority to approve or disapprove key appointments.
