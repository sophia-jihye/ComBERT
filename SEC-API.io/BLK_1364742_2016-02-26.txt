We also offer our BlackRock Solutions &#174; (&#8220;BRS&#8221;) investment and risk management technology platform, Aladdin &#174; , risk analytics and advisory services and solutions to a broad base of institutional investors. The Company is highly regulated and serves its clients as a fiduciary. We do not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of our clients.

Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail investors. 

BlackRock maintains a significant global sales and marketing presence that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to investors directly and through financial professionals and pension consultants, and establishing third-party distribution relationships. 

BlackRock is an independent, publicly traded company, with no single majority shareholder and over two-thirds of its Board of Directors consisting of independent directors. At December 31, 2015, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (&#8220;PNC&#8221;) held 21.1% of BlackRock&#8217;s voting common stock and 22.2% of BlackRock&#8217;s capital stock, which includes outstanding common stock and nonvoting preferred stock. 

Management seeks to achieve attractive returns for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on the following factors: 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the Company&#8217;s focus on strong performance providing alpha for active products and limited or no tracking error for index products; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the Company&#8217;s global reach and commitment to best practices around the world, with approximately 48% of employees outside the United States supporting local investment capabilities and serving clients, and approximately 42% of total AUM managed for clients domiciled outside the United States; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the Company&#8217;s diversified active and index product offerings, which enhance its ability to offer a variety of traditional and alternative investment products across the risk spectrum and to tailor single- and multi-asset investment solutions to address specific client needs; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the Company&#8217;s differentiated client relationships and fiduciary focus, which enable effective positioning toward changing client needs and macro trends including the secular shift to passive investing and ETFs, a focus on income and retirement, and barbelling of risk using index and active products, including alternatives; and 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the Company&#8217;s longstanding commitment to risk management and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BRS products and services. 

BlackRock operates in a global marketplace characterized by a high degree of market volatility and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings and stockholder returns in any given period. 

The Company&#8217;s ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability to generate new business, including business in BRS products and services. New business efforts depend on BlackRock&#8217;s ability to achieve clients&#8217; investment objectives in a manner consistent with their risk preferences and to deliver excellent client service. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract, develop and retain talented professionals is critical to the Company&#8217;s long-term success.

BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;); however, management believes evaluating the Company&#8217;s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. 

See Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Non-GAAP Financial Measures, for further information on non-GAAP financial measures and for as adjusted items for 2015, 2014, and 2013. In 2012, operating income, as adjusted, included an adjustment related to estimated lease exit costs initially recorded in 2011 and the contribution to certain of the Company&#8217;s bank-managed short-term investment funds (&#8220;STIFs&#8221;). In 2011, operating income, as adjusted, included U.K. lease exit costs which represent costs to exit two locations in London and restructuring charges. In 2012 and 2011, the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (&#8220;LTIP&#8221;) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because it ultimately did not impact BlackRock&#8217;s book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in nonoperating income (expense). 

(3) 

Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted exclude the after-tax impact of the items listed above and also include the effect on deferred income tax expense resulting from certain income tax matters.

Amounts also include AUM acquired in the acquisitions of certain assets of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors LLC (&#8220;BKCA&#8221;) in March 2015, Infraestructura Institucional and FutureAdvisor in October 2015, and other reclassifications to conform to current period combined AUM policy and presentation. Amounts also include Barclays Global Investors merger-related outflows due to manager concentration considerations prior to the third quarter of 2011 and outflows from scientific active equity performance prior to the second quarter of 2011. As a result of 

client investment manager concentration limits and the scientific active equity performance, outflows were expected to occur for a period of time subsequent to the close of the transaction.

AUM represents the broad range of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for billing (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice, or assets that we are retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis. 

Investment management fees are typically expressed as a percentage of AUM. We also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. On some products, we also may earn securities lending revenue. In addition, BlackRock offers its proprietary Aladdin investment system as well as risk management, outsourcing and advisory services, to institutional investors under the BRS name. Revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions, number of users, accomplishment of specific deliverables or other objectives. 

At December 31, 2015, total AUM was $4.645 trillion, representing a CAGR of 5% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net inflows and acquisitions, including Claymore and SRPEP, which collectively added $13.7 billion of AUM in 2012, Credit Suisse and MGPA, which collectively added $26.9 billion of AUM in 2013 and BKCA, Infraestructura Institucional and FutureAdvisor, which collectively added $2.2 billion of AUM in 2015. Our AUM mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range, as described below. 

The Company considers the categorization of its AUM by client type, product type, investment style and client region useful to understanding its business. The following discussion of the Company&#8217;s AUM will be organized as follows:

Retail 

BlackRock serves retail investors globally through a wide array of vehicles across the active and passive spectrum, including separate accounts, open-end and closed-end funds, unit trusts and private investment funds. Retail investors are served principally through intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, insurance companies and independent financial advisors. Clients invest primarily in mutual funds, which totaled $446.4 billion, or 83%, of retail long-term AUM at year-end, with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts (&#8220;SMAs&#8221;). The majority (92%) of long-term retail AUM is invested in active products, although this is impacted by iShares being shown separately. Retail represented 13% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2015 and 35% of long-term base fees for 2015. 

Component changes in retail long-term AUM for 2015 are presented below.

Amounts represent $1.3 billion of AUM acquired in the BKCA acquisition in March 2015 and $366 million of AUM acquired in the FutureAdvisor acquisition in October 2015. The FutureAdvisor acquisition amount does not include AUM that was held in iShares holdings. 

The retail client base is diversified geographically, with 70% of long-term AUM managed for investors based in the Americas, 24% in EMEA and 6% in Asia-Pacific at year-end 2015. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

U.S. retail long-term net inflows of $18.7 billion, or 5% organic growth, were led by fixed income net inflows of $20.9 billion. Fixed income net inflows were diversified across exposures and products, with strong flows into our unconstrained, high yield and core bond offerings. Equity net inflows of $1.3 billion were driven by flows into our index mutual funds, and we continued to make progress on the reinvigoration and globalization of our fundamental active equity business. Multi-asset class net outflows of $2.5 billion were primarily due to a large single-client transition out of mutual funds into a series of iShares across asset classes. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

International retail long-term net inflows of $19.8 billion, representing 12% organic growth, were positive across major regions and diversified across asset classes. Fixed income products generated net inflows of $10.3 billion, led by short duration and unconstrained strategies as investors looked to manage duration and generate yield in their portfolios. Multi-asset class net inflows of $1.2 billion were driven by flows into managed volatility strategies and the cross-border version of our Multi-Asset Income fund. Equity net inflows of $7.2 billion reflected strong flows into international equities. Alternatives net inflows totaled $1.2 billion, and we remain committed to broadening the distribution of alternatives funds to bring institutional quality alternatives to retail investors. 

iShares 

iShares is the leading ETF provider in the world, with $1.1 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2015 and was the top asset gatherer globally in 2015 1 with $129.9 billion of net inflows for an organic growth rate of 13%. Equity net inflows of $78.4 billion were driven by flows into the Core Series and into funds with broad developed market equity exposures, partially offset by outflows from emerging market products. Record fixed income net inflows of $50.3 billion were diversified across exposures and product lines, led by flows into core, corporate and high yield bond funds. iShares multi-asset class and alternatives funds contributed a combined $1.2 billion of net inflows, primarily into core allocation funds. iShares represented 25% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2015 and 35% of long-term base fees for 2015.

Our broad iShares product range offers investors a precise, transparent and efficient way to tap market returns and gain access to a full range of asset classes and global markets that have been difficult for many investors to access, as well as the liquidity required to make adjustments to their exposures quickly and cost-efficiently. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

U.S. iShares AUM ended 2015 at $811.4 billion with $97.2 billion of net inflows driven by strong demand for the Core Series and broad developed market equities as well as a diverse range of fixed income products. 2 In 2015, we saw increased investor focus on risk-aware, &#8220;smart beta&#8221; products, with our minimum volatility funds raising $8.3 billion . 

&#160;

&#8226; 

International iShares AUM ended 2015 at $281.1 billion with net inflows of $32.7 billion led by fixed income net inflows of $19.2 billion, primarily into yield-focused categories including high yield and investment grade corporate debt. 2 Our international Core Series ranges in Canada and Europe demonstrated solid results in their second year, raising a combined $14.1 billion in net inflows as we continue to expand our international presence among buy-and-hold investors.

Institutional

Amounts represent $560 million of AUM acquired in the Infraestructura Institucional acquisition in October 2015.

Institutional active AUM ended 2015 at $962.9 billion, reflecting $26.8 billion of net inflows. Institutional active represented 22% of long-term AUM and 20% of long-term base fees. Growth in AUM reflected continued strength in multi-asset class products with net inflows of $18.4 billion reflecting ongoing demand for solutions offerings and the LifePath &#174; target-date suite. Our top-performing fixed income platform generated net inflows of $5.7 billion, diversified across exposures. Alternatives net inflows of $3.1 billion were led by inflows into infrastructure and alternatives solutions offerings. In addition, 2015 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives, and we raised over $5 billion in new commitments, which will be a source of future net inflows. Equity net outflows of $0.5 billion reflected fundamental net outflows of $2.2 billion, which were partially offset by scientific net inflows of $1.7 billion. 

Institutional index AUM totaled $1.739 trillion at December 31, 2015, reflecting net outflows of $43.1 billion. Equity net outflows of $33.7 billion were primarily due to low-fee global and regional index equity outflows as clients looked to re-allocate, re-balance or meet their cash needs. Fixed income net outflows of $10.2 billion were concentrated in local currency mandates, linked to outflows from liability management strategies. Institutional index represented 40% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2015 and accounted for 10% of long-term base fees for 2015. 

The Company&#8217;s institutional clients consist of the following: 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Pensions, Foundations and Endowments. BlackRock is among the world&#8217;s largest managers of pension plan assets with $1.847 trillion, or 68%, of long-term institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2015. The market landscape is shifting from defined benefit to defined contribution, driving strong flows in our defined contribution channel, which had $36.2 billion of long-term net inflows for the year, or 6% organic growth, driven by continued demand for our LifePath target-date suite. Defined contribution represented $630.9 billion of total pension AUM, and we remain well positioned to capitalize on the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market and demand for outcome-oriented investments. An additional $52.8 billion, or 2% of long-term institutional AUM, was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Official Institutions. We also managed $185.0 billion, or 7%, of long-term institutional AUM for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies at year-end 2015. These clients often require specialized investment advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Financial and Other Institutions. BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $237.7 billion, or 9%, of institutional long-term AUM at year-end 2015. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which we provide sub-advisory services, totaled $379.4 billion, or 14%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end.

Amounts represent $1.3 billion of AUM acquired in the BKCA acquisition in March 2015, $560 million of AUM acquired in the Infraestructura Institucional acquisition in October 2015 and $366 million of AUM acquired in the FutureAdvisor acquisition in October 2015. The FutureAdvisor acquisition amount does not include AUM that was held in iShares holdings.

Long-term product offerings include active and index strategies. Our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile. We offer two types of active strategies: those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive portfolio construction. In contrast, index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index, generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index. Index strategies include both our non-ETF index products and iShares ETFs. 

Although many clients use both active and index strategies, the application of these strategies may differ. For example, clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class. In addition, institutional non-ETF index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion dollars) and typically reflect low fee rates. This has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index products on BlackRock&#8217;s revenues and earnings. 

Equity 

Year-end 2015 equity AUM totaled $2.424 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $52.8 billion. Net inflows included $78.4 billion and $4.2 billion into iShares and active products, respectively. iShares net inflows were driven by the Core Series and flows into broad developed market equity exposures, and active net inflows reflected demand for international equities. iShares and active net inflows were partially offset by non-ETF index net outflows of $29.8 billion. 

BlackRock&#8217;s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUM mix. Approximately half of BlackRock&#8217;s equity AUM is tied to international markets, including emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than U.S. equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international equity markets, which do not consistently move in tandem with U.S. markets, may have a greater impact on BlackRock&#8217;s effective equity fee rates and revenues. 

Fixed Income 

Fixed income AUM ended 2015 at $1.422 trillion, increasing $28.7 billion, or 2%, from December 31, 2014. The increase in AUM reflected $76.9 billion in net inflows, partially offset by $48.2 billion in net market depreciation and foreign exchange movements. In 2015, active net inflows of $35.9 billion were diversified across fixed income offerings, with strong flows into our unconstrained, total return and high yield strategies. Flagship funds in these product areas include our unconstrained Strategic Income Opportunities and Fixed Income Strategies funds, with net inflows of $7.0 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively; our Total Return fund with net inflows of $2.7 billion; and our High Yield Bond fund with net inflows of $3.5 billion. Fixed income iShares net inflows of $50.3 billion were led by flows into core, corporate and high yield bond funds. Active and iShares net inflows were partially offset by non-ETF index net outflows of $9.3 billion. 

Multi-Asset Class 

BlackRock&#8217;s multi-asset class team manages a variety of balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities, bonds, currencies and commodities, and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays.

Amounts represent $366 million of AUM acquired in the FutureAdvisor acquisition in October 2015. The FutureAdvisor acquisition amount does not include AUM that was held in iShares holdings.

Multi-asset class net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutions-based advice with $17.4 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients. Defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows, and contributed $7.3 billion to institutional multi-asset class net new business in 2015, primarily into target date and target risk product offerings. Retail net outflows of $1.3 billion were primarily due to a large single-client transition out of mutual funds into a series of iShares across asset classes. Notwithstanding this transition, retail flows reflected demand for our Multi-Asset Income fund family, which raised $4.6 billion in 2015.

The Company&#8217;s multi-asset class strategies include the following: 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Asset allocation and balanced products represented 49% of multi-asset class AUM at year-end, with growth in AUM driven by net new business of $12.9 billion. These strategies combine equity, fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions. Flagship products in this category include our Global Allocation and Multi-Asset Income suites. &#160; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Target date and target risk product flows were impacted by a large single-client transition out of mutual funds into a series of iShares across asset classes. Institutional investors represented 95% of target date and target risk AUM, with defined contribution plans accounting for over 88% of AUM. Flows were driven by defined contribution investments in our LifePath and LifePath Retirement Income &#174; offerings. LifePath products utilize a proprietary asset allocation model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor&#8217;s expected retirement timing. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Fiduciary management services are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors or endowments and foundations retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of plan management. These customized services require strong partnership with the clients&#8217; investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

FutureAdvisor is a leading digital wealth management platform, acquired by BlackRock in October 2015. FutureAdvisor operates as a service within BRS, providing financial institutions with high quality, technology-enabled advice capabilities to improve their clients&#8217; investment experience. As consumers increasingly engage with technology to invest, BlackRock and FutureAdvisor are positioned to empower distribution partners to better serve their clients by combining FutureAdvisor&#8217;s high-quality technology-enabled advice with BlackRock&#8217;s multi-asset investment capabilities, proprietary technology and risk analytics

Alternatives 

BlackRock Alternative Investors (&#8220;BAI&#8221;) focuses on sourcing and managing high-alpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing. Our alternatives products fall into two main categories &#8212; 1) core, and 2) currency and commodities. Core includes alternative solutions, direct hedge funds, hedge fund and private equity solutions (funds of funds), opportunistic private equity and credit, real estate and infrastructure offerings. The products offered under the BAI umbrella are described below. 

In 2015, BlackRock returned $3.3 billion of capital to investors, which is included in outflows. In addition, we raised $5.7 billion of new commitments in 2015 across a variety of strategies, including private equity solutions, opportunistic credit, alternative solutions, real estate and infrastructure. At year-end, we had $10.9 billion of non-fee paying, unfunded commitments, which are expected to be deployed in future years; these commitments are not included in AUM until they are invested. 

We believe that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies, investors will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings. As a top ten alternative provider 3 our highly diversified $112.8 billion alternatives franchise is well positioned to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors.

Return of capital is included in outflows. 

Core. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Alternative Solutions represent holistic, highly customized portfolios of alternative investments. In 2015, alternative solutions portfolios had $1.4 billion of net inflows. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Hedge Funds net inflows of $0.1 billion were led by net inflows of $0.5 billion into hedge fund solutions, our funds of hedge funds offering, partially offset by $0.4 billion of net outflows from direct hedge funds. Direct hedge fund AUM includes a variety of single- and multi-strategy offerings. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Illiquid and Opportunistic AUM included $12.4 billion in private equity solutions and $2.4 billion in opportunistic private equity and credit offerings. Net inflows of $1.0 billion were predominantly into private equity solutions. Our acquisition of certain assets of BKCA further enhanced our credit platform through the addition of a middle market, private credit capability. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Real Assets AUM totaled $24.3 billion, up $1.5 billion, or 7%. Real assets, which include infrastructure and real estate, saw net inflows of $1.7 billion. In 2015, we continued to build our infrastructure capabilities through the acquisition of Infraestructura Institucional, a leading infrastructure investment business in Mexico. This acquisition advances our growth strategy in Mexico and Latin America and furthers our commitment to being a leader in infrastructure investing.

&#160;

Currency and Commodities. 

AUM in currency and commodities declined 11% from year-end 2014, reflecting portfolio valuation declines of $3.5 billion. Currency and commodities products include a range of active and passive products. Our iShares commodities products represented $12.5 billion of AUM and are not eligible for performance fees.

Cash Management 

Cash management AUM totaled $299.9 billion at December 31, 2015, up $3.5 billion, or 1%, from year-end 2014. Cash management products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios are denominated in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros or British pounds. We generated net inflows of $7.5 billion during 2015, a period marked by a near zero interest rate environment. BlackRock is working to bring all U.S. money market funds into full compliance with new regulatory requirements in advance of the 2016 deadlines, and is actively repurposing and streamlining our product lineup to meet the future requirements of clients. In Europe, we continue to be a market leader highlighted by our implementation of the reverse distribution mechanism in our euro funds when faced with negative rates. In November 2015, BlackRock and Bank of America&#8217;s asset management business, BofA Global Capital Management (&#8220;BACM&#8221;) entered into an agreement to transfer to BlackRock investment management responsibilities for approximately $87 billion of AUM in cash products currently managed by BACM. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2016, subject to customary approvals and closing conditions. 

Client Region 

Our footprints in the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions reflect strong relationships with intermediaries and an established ability to deliver our global investment expertise in funds and other products tailored to local regulations and requirements.

Americas. 

Long-term net new business of $144.6 billion was positive across all asset classes, with net inflows of $84.6 billion, $49.7 billion, $6.3 billion and $4.0 billion in equity, fixed income, multi-asset class and alternatives products, respectively. During the year, we served clients through offices in 31 states in the United States as well as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Spain. 

EMEA. 

During the year, clients awarded us long-term net new business of $8.7 billion, including inflows from investors in 23 countries across the region. EMEA net new business was led by fixed income net inflows of $10.8 billion, reflecting strong flows into iShares and unconstrained fixed income. Our offerings include fund families in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Dublin and iShares listed on stock exchanges throughout Europe as well as separate accounts and pooled investment products. 

Asia-Pacific. 

Clients in the Asia-Pacific region are served through offices in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, China, and India. Long-term net outflows of $1.3 billion were due to equity net outflows of $20.2 billion, primarily from institutional index mandates. Fixed income, multi-asset class and alternatives saw net inflows of $16.5 billion, $2.3 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively.

BlackRock Solutions 

BRS offers investment management technology systems, risk management services and advisory services on a fee basis. Aladdin is our proprietary technology platform, which serves as the risk management system for both BlackRock and a growing number of sophisticated institutional investors around the world. BRS also offers comprehensive risk reporting capabilities via the Green Package&#174; and risk management advisory services; interactive fixed income analytics through our web-based calculator, AnSer&#174;; middle and back office outsourcing services; and investment accounting. BRS&#8217; Financial Markets Advisory (&#8220;FMA&#8221;) group advises global financial institutions, regulators, and government entities on complex financial and risk issues though core competencies across capital markets, data analysis and modeling; strategic advice regarding regulatory compliance, risk management, business transformations and transaction support; and integrated project management. FutureAdvisor, acquired by BlackRock in 2015, is a digital wealth management platform operating within BRS that provides financial institutions with high quality, technology-enabled advice capabilities to improve their clients&#8217; investment experience. 

BRS record revenues of $646 million were up 2% year-over-year. Aladdin , which represented 82% of BRS revenue for the year, continues to benefit from trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. Aladdin assignments are typically long-term contracts that provide significant recurring revenue. 

Our FMA group continued to post solid revenues, even as the business transitions from a &#8220;crisis management&#8221; emphasis to a more institutionalized advisory business model, with a strong focus on helping clients navigate and implement requirements for the evolving regulatory environment. Advisory AUM decreased to $10.2 billion, driven by $9.6 billion of planned client distributions reflecting our continued success in disposing of assets for clients at, or above, targeted levels. 

At year-end, BRS served clients, including banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers and other institutional investors across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. 

Securities Lending 

Securities lending is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. BlackRock receives both cash (primarily for U.S. domiciled portfolios) and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements. The cash management team invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Fees for securities lending for U.S. domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings, or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM. 

Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $218 billion, up from $187 billion at year-end 2014. Liability spreads were generally flat compared to 2014 levels. 

BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity and interest rate risk management. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock&#8217;s Cash Management Credit Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived temporarily, such waivers are infrequent. 

Risk &#38; Quantitative Analysis 

Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk &#38; Quantitative Analysis (&#8220;RQA&#8221;) group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and operational risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics. 

&#160;

&#160;

COMPETITION 

BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for index products, investment style and discipline, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service. 

Geographic Information 

At December 31, 2015, BlackRock served clients in more than 100 countries across the globe, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. See Note 22, Segment Information , contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, BlackRock had a total of approximately 13,000 employees, including approximately 6,200 located in offices outside the United States. Consistent with our commitment to continually expand and enhance our talent base to support our clients, we added approximately 800 employees during the year, including in strategic focus areas.

&#160;

REGULATION 

Virtually all aspects of BlackRock&#8217;s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, trust customers of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (&#8220;BTC&#8221;), PNC and its bank subsidiaries and their customers and the financial system. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and bank holding companies and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines both for individuals and BlackRock. 

The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report. 

GLOBAL REGULATORY REFORM 

BlackRock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives around the world. Any such initiative, or any new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock&#8217;s business activities, lead to business disruptions, require BlackRock to alter its business or operating activities and expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and legal costs) as well as reputational harm. BlackRock&#8217;s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing banking, taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce. 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;DFA&#8221;) was signed into law in the U.S. The DFA is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions, many of which have been adopted. BlackRock has commenced a conformance program to address certain regulations adopted under the DFA, as well as financial reforms that have been introduced as part of the SEC&#8217;s investment company modernization initiatives. The cost of these initial conformance activities have been absorbed by BlackRock; however, as the full extent of the DFA and other rules will only become evident over time, it is not yet possible to predict the ultimate effects that the DFA, or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions, will have upon BlackRock&#8217;s business, financial condition, and operating activities. 

Systemically Important Financial Institution Review 

Both the Financial Stability Board (&#8220;FSB&#8221;) working with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (&#8220;IOSCO&#8221;) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (&#8220;FSOC&#8221;) are considering potential systemic risk related to asset management. In July 2014, the FSOC issued a statement indicating that their review would focus on products and activities, and FSOC subsequently released a request for information addressing: market liquidity and fund redemption risk, the use of leverage, operational risk, and the resolution of asset managers including the transition of client assets. In June 2015, IOSCO issued a statement indicating they also favored a products and activities approach in their review of asset managers, and in July 2015, the FSB made a similar announcement. In September 2015, the FSB released a statement indicating that their review would focus on: market liquidity and fund redemption risk, the use of leverage, securities lending practices, operational risk, and risks from pension funds and sovereign wealth funds.

Although FSOC, IOSCO and FSB have shifted from a focus on designating firms and/or funds as systemically important (i.e., G-SIFI or SIFI designations), the process is ongoing and may lead to designations in the future. In the event that BlackRock receives a SIFI designation, under the DFA, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) is charged with establishing enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions and BlackRock could become subject to direct supervision by the Federal Reserve. If BlackRock was designated a SIFI or G-SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced prudential, capital, supervisory and other requirements, such as risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements, concentration limits, a contingent capital requirement, enhanced public disclosures, short-term debt limits and overall risk management requirements. Requirements such as these, which were designed to regulate banking institutions, would be extremely burdensome for BlackRock, unless they were modified to be applicable to an asset manager. No proposals have been made indicating how such measures would be adapted for asset managers, if at all. 

Securities and Exchange Commission Review of Asset Managers 

BlackRock&#8217;s business may also be impacted by Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) regulatory initiatives. The SEC and its staff continue to engage in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular. During 2015, the SEC proposed, among other things: enhanced reporting by investment advisors, enhanced reporting on registered mutual funds, new rules for liquidity risk management in registered funds, and new rules governing the use of derivatives and leverage by registered investment companies and business development companies. Furthermore, in June 2015, the SEC issued a request for comments regarding practices related to exchange-traded funds (&#8220;ETFs&#8221;), which is 

widely expected to result in a future rulemaking. The SEC has also indicated an intention to propose new rules for the stress testing of registered investment companies and transition planning by asset managers, including the transfer of client assets. The SEC&#8217;s focus has also been directed toward risk identification and controls in various areas, including the use of derivatives and other trading practices (as reflected in the SEC&#8217;s late December 2015 rule proposal described more particularly under&#8221; &#8211; Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives below ) , cyber-security and the evaluation of systemic risks. While these proposals have yet to be finali zed into new rules, a ny new rules, guidance or regulatory initiatives resulting from these efforts could expose BlackRock to additional compliance and reporting costs and may require the Company to change how it operates its business or manages funds . 

Money Market Fund Reform 

In July 2014, the SEC adopted new rules designed to reform the regulatory structure governing money market funds (&#8220;MMFs&#8221;) and to address the perceived systemic risks that such funds present. The new rules, to which U.S. MMFs must conform by October 2016, require institutional prime and institutional municipal MMFs to employ a floating net asset value per share method of pricing, which allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of fund assets. Retail MMFs may continue operating with a constant net asset value per share. The rules also provide for new tools for institutional and retail MMFs&#8217; boards designed to address market shocks, including liquidity fees and redemption gates. The new rules do not apply to government (non-municipal) MMFs, although such funds may &#8220;opt-in&#8221; to the new liquidity fee and redemption gate provisions if previously disclosed to investors. Implementation of these new rules requires the development of new or additional systems by BlackRock and the funds&#8217; service providers. BlackRock has commenced efforts to move its MMFs into compliance in advance of the deadline. The impact of the rules that affect the structure of the funds on BlackRock&#8217;s business remains uncertain as clients must decide which products fit their investment needs. The new rules will, however, affect certain of BlackRock&#8217;s funds&#8217; investment strategies, portfolio liquidity and return potential. The new rules will also result in changes to BlackRock&#8217;s existing U.S. MMFs and may reduce the attractiveness of certain U.S. MMFs to investors.

Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives 

The SEC, the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;) each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives. Such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts. If adopted, these limitations could require BlackRock to change certain business practices or implement new reporting or compliance processes, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions. In December 2015, the SEC proposed a new rule governing the use of derivatives and other financial commitment transactions by investment companies that, if enacted, would represent a fundamental change in the nature of the SEC's regulations governing the use of derivatives and other financial commitment transactions by investment companies. This proposal has the potential to require BlackRock to change or restrict certain investment strategies or practices for some investment companies and incur additional costs. In some circumstances the proposed rule could make certain products less competitive with other investment options in the marketplace, which could negatively impact assets under management. 

Further, the full implementation of regulations under the DFA and similar regulations in the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) and other global jurisdictions relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives could impact the manner in which BlackRock-advised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives, increasing the costs of derivatives trading for BlackRock&#8217;s clients. For example, various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds, accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require BlackRock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject. These rules also introduce new requirements for centrally clearing certain swaps transactions and for executing certain swaps transactions on or through CFTC or SEC-registered trading venues (as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods). 

Jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which BlackRock operates also have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of considering, adopting or implementing more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could further impact BlackRock and the broader markets. This includes the implementation of mandated central clearing of swaps in the EU and the implementation of trade reporting, documentation, central clearing and other requirements in various jurisdictions globally. 

In the United States, certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are already subject to the DFA central clearing and electronic trading venue requirements, with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in 2016 and beyond. For swaps and security-based swaps that are not centrally cleared, U.S. bank regulators recently adopted rules that could require BlackRock-advised funds and accounts to post margin payments when trading with a swap dealer that is regulated by one of the U.S. bank regulators. The CFTC also recently adopted similar margin rules applicable when trading non-cleared swaps with swap dealers who are not regulated by one of the U.S. bank regulators. These rules have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading non-cleared derivatives for BlackRock's clients. In EMEA, central clearing requirements will be implemented in a phased manner and will apply to BlackRock funds and accounts beginning in the latter half of 2016. The new rules and regulations may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase BlackRock&#8217;s operational and legal risks.

Regulation of Exchange Traded Funds 

As a result of recent market volatility, regulators globally are examining the potential risks in ETFs, including those related to transparency, liquidity and structural resiliency. BlackRock and other large issuers of ETFs are working with market participants and regulators to address certain of these issues but there can be no assurance that structural or regulatory reforms will be implemented in a manner favorable to BlackRock, or at all. Depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis, or any associated structural reforms, ETF products may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or restrictions, which may require BlackRock to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business.

Taxation 

BlackRock&#8217;s businesses may be affected by new tax legislation or regulations, or the modification of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings, by U.S. or non-U.S. authorities. In particular, BlackRock may be impacted by the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (&#8220;FATCA&#8221;) and the Common Reporting Standard (&#8220;CRS&#8221;) which have introduced new investor onboarding, withholding and reporting rules aimed at ensuring persons with financial assets outside of the their tax residence country pay appropriate taxes. FATCA and CRS rules will impact both U.S. and 

non-U.S. funds and subject BlackRock to additional administrative burdens. In many instances, bilateral Intergovernmental Agreements (&#8220;IGAs&#8221;) between the U.S. and the countries in which BlackRock does business will g overn implementation of the new rules. While many of these IGAs have been put into place, others have yet to be concluded. 

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (&#8220;OECD&#8221;) has also launched a base erosion and profit shifting (&#8220;BEPS&#8221;) proposal that aims to rationalize tax treatment across jurisdictions. In October 2015, the OECD released its final BEPS package in an effort to curb the use of certain tax regimes and elements of tax planning, primarily in a cross-border context. The final package was endorsed by the G20 and is subject to implementation. In addition, in January 2016, the European Commission announced an Anti-Tax Avoidance Package (&#8220;EU Package&#8221;) for consideration by the European Parliament and Council, containing measures to regulate certain elements of tax planning and to boost tax transparency. Once implemented, the BEPS package and the EU Package could curtail the amount of investments channeled by, and have unintended taxation consequences for funds as well as BlackRock&#8217;s overall tax position, which could adversely affect BlackRock&#8217;s financial condition and that of its clients.

In addition, certain EU Member States, such as France and Italy, have enacted financial transaction taxes (&#8220;FTTs&#8221;) which impose taxation on a broad range of financial instruments and derivatives transactions. Several other Member States continue to discuss introducing FTTs. In general, any tax on securities and derivatives transactions would impact investors and would likely have a negative impact on the liquidity of the securities and derivatives markets, could diminish the attractiveness of certain types of products that BlackRock manages in those countries and could cause clients to shift assets away from such products. An FTT could significantly increase the operational costs of BlackRock entering into, on behalf of its clients, securities and derivatives transactions that would be subjected to an FTT, which could adversely impact BlackRock&#8217;s financial results and clients&#8217; performance results.

Lastly, the application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and, in the normal course of business, U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities may review and challenge BlackRock&#8217;s historical tax positions. These challenges may result in adjustments to BlackRock&#8217;s tax position, or impact the timing or amount of taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock&#8217;s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. 

Volcker Rule 

Provisions of the DFA referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221; place limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds, including hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds (collectively &#8220;covered funds&#8221;). Because the Federal Reserve currently treats BlackRock as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC, BlackRock may be required to conform its activities to the requirements of the Volcker Rule. On December 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve announced a second extension to the Volcker Rule conformance period, giving banking entities until July 21, 2016, to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds and foreign funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013 (&#8220;legacy covered funds&#8221;). The Federal Reserve also announced its intention to grant banking entities an additional one-year extension of the conformance period until July 21, 2017, to conform ownership interests in and relationships with these legacy covered funds. The Volcker Rule&#8217;s restrictions may, among other things, limit BlackRock&#8217;s ability to invest in covered funds and require BlackRock to remove its name from the names of its covered funds, which could subject BlackRock to additional expense. The Volcker Rule may also require BlackRock to sell certain seed and co-investments that it holds in covered funds which may occur at a discount to existing carrying value, depending on market conditions. The Volcker Rule may also reduce the level of market making and liquidity activities of several of BlackRock&#8217;s trading counterparties, which may adversely impact the liquidity and, in some cases, the pricing of various financial instruments in which BlackRock client accounts invest. For a further discussion of the Volcker Rule, see &#8220;Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors &#8212; Legal and Regulatory Risks.&#8221; 

Revised Department of Labor (&#8220;DoL&#8221;) Fiduciary Rule

In April 2015, the DoL proposed a new regulation defining the term "fiduciary" for purposes of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;) and the prohibited transaction exercise tax provisions of the IRS. The rule has been highly criticized by industry participants, particularly retail intermediaries, and BlackRock is engaging with the DoL, trade associations and industry participants in an effort to affect revisions to the proposed rule. To the extent the rule is enacted as written, it will require BlackRock to re-paper a number of its distribution relationships, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock&#8217;s distribution partners and may limit BlackRock&#8217;s ability to provide certain useful services and education to its clients. 

Markets in Financial Instruments Directives 

BlackRock is also subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives in Europe. For example, in the EU rules and regulations made under the current Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (&#8220;MiFID&#8221;) regime (described more particularly under &#8220;&#8212; European Regulation&#8221; below) are in the process of being revised through implementation of the &#8220;MiFID II&#8221; package of measures made up of a recast Directive and a new Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation. MiFID II, which was originally scheduled to come into effect in January 2017, but is now scheduled to come into effect in January 2018, will be implemented through a number of Implementing and Regulatory Technical Standards to be made through Delegated Acts made by the European Commission following advice from the European Securities and Markets Authority (&#8220;ESMA&#8221;). MiFID II will build upon many of the measures introduced by MiFID, and will extend investor protection, trading transparency, clearing and trading venue access and reporting requirements. It is expected that MiFID II will have significant and wide-ranging impacts on EU securities and derivatives markets. In particular, there will be (i) enhanced governance and investor protection standards, (ii) prescriptive rules on portfolio management firms&#8217; ability to receive and pay for investment research relating to all asset classes, (iii) enhanced regulation of algorithmic trading, (iv) the movement of trading in certain shares and derivatives on to regulated execution venues, (v) the extension of pre- and post-trade transparency requirements to wider categories of financial instruments, (vi) restrictions on the use of so-called dark pool trading, (vii) the creation of a new type of trading venue called the Organized Trading Facility for non-equity financial instruments, (viii) commodity derivative position limits and reporting requirements, (ix) a move away from vertical silos in execution, clearing and settlement, (x) an enhanced role for ESMA in supervising EU securities and derivatives markets and (xi) new requirements regarding non-EU investment firms&#8217; access to EU financial markets. Implementation of these measures will have direct and indirect impacts on BlackRock and its subsidiaries and may require significant changes to client servicing models. A significant number of the impacts are yet to be determined because MiFID II contains a wide ranging and complex set of measures. 

Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities 

The EU has also adopted directives on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (&#8220;UCITS&#8221;). The latest initiative in this area, UCITS V seeks to align the UCITS depositary regime, UCITS remuneration rules and regulators&#8217; power to sanction for breaches of the UCITS Directive with the requirements of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (&#8220;AIFMD&#8221;). UCITS V is required to be adopted in the national law of each EU member state by March 18, 2016 though further implementing measures will only become effective in late 2016. Compliance with the updated UCITS directive will subject BlackRock to additional expenses associated with new depositary oversight and other organizational requirements. 

Reform of European Retail Distribution 

BlackRock must also comply with retail distribution rules aimed at enhancing consumer protections, overhauling mutual fund fee structures by banning the payment of commissions to distributors and increasing professionalism in the retail investment sector. The rules were originally introduced in the United Kingdom in 2012 and similar rules have since been introduced in other jurisdictions where BlackRock operates such as the Netherlands, and are under discussion elsewhere. Similarly, MiFID II will contain a ban on certain advisers recovering commissions and other nonmonetary benefits from fund managers. These rules will lead to greater fragmentation of distribution rules and may lead to changes to BlackRock&#8217;s client servicing and distribution models, in particular affecting the fees BlackRock is able to charge to its clients and the commissions it is able to pay to its distribution partners. 

EU Benchmarks Regulation 

Political agreement on the EU Benchmarks Regulation was reached at the end of 2015. The Regulation provides the legislative framework to implement the 2013 IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks. The scope of the Regulation is broad as it includes submission based benchmarks through to transaction based market indices. Proportionality is applied to create a stricter framework for the systemically relevant benchmarks such as LIBOR and EURIBOR. Although the Regulation creates a number of obligations on administrators of, and submitters to, benchmarks, it is less extensive as regards the obligations of users of benchmarks, such as asset managers. The Regulation formalizes due diligence procedures for users and implies other additional administrative requirements of users of third-party benchmarks. Managers using third-party and/or bespoke benchmarks to assess fund performance are also caught by the Regulation. It is expected that detailed rule-making underpinning the Regulation's framework will be developed during 2016 and implemented beginning in 2018. While it is not yet possible to assess the full effect of the Regulation on BlackRock's business, it may impose additional administrative and due diligence requirements on the Company, the burden of which is likely to increase as BlackRock makes additional enhancements to its indexing business.

Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (&#8220;FinCEN&#8221;) Proposed Rulemaking for Registered Investment Advisers

FinCEN has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (&#8220;Proposed Rule&#8221;) that would extend to a number of BlackRock&#8217;s subsidiaries, which are registered or required to be registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the &#8220;Advisers Act&#8221;), the requirement to establish anti-money laundering programs and report suspicious activity to FinCEN under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (the &#8220;Bank Secrecy Act&#8221;). The Proposed Rule would extend to those BlackRock subsidiaries captured within the Bank Secrecy Act&#8217;s definition of &#8220;financial institutions&#8221;, which would require them to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act reporting and recordkeeping requirements. If enacted in its current form, the Proposed Rule would expose BlackRock to additional compliance costs. 

Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) Asset Management Market Survey

As part of its strategic priorities, the FCA is undertaking a market study into the asset management sector. The aim of this study is to understand whether competition is working effectively to enable both institutional and retail investors to get value for money when purchasing asset management services. The FCA is interested in understanding whether there are any barriers to innovation or technological advances which may be preventing new ways of doing business that could benefit investors (Fintech). If the FCA concludes that competition is not working well, the FCA may intervene through rule-making, introducing firm-specific remedies or enforcement action, publishing general guidance or proposing enhanced industry self-regulation. BlackRock is one of 40 firms included in the study and is currently responding to an information request that consists of qualitative and quantitative data. The FCA is aiming to engage with firms throughout 2016 with the proposal to issue a draft report to the industry in the summer of 2016. The FCA expect to publish their final report in early 2017. 

EXISTING U.S. REGULATION - OVERVIEW 

BlackRock and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries are currently subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the DoL, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;), the National Futures Association (&#8220;NFA&#8221;), the CFTC and other government agencies and regulatory bodies. Certain of BlackRock&#8217;s U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering regulations and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies. 

The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;) imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock and its affiliated companies. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser&#8217;s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage. 

BlackRock&#8217;s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), as well as the rules of various securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations and reporting obligations) and market regulation policies. Violation of any of these laws and regulations could result in restrictions on BlackRock&#8217;s activities and damage its 

reputation. Furthermore, one of BlackRock&#8217;s subsidiaries, BTC, was required to register as a municipal advisor (as that term is defined in the statute) with the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Boar d (&#8220;MSRB&#8221;) as a result of SEC rules giving effect to a section of the DFA requiring such registration. The rules subject BTC to new and additional regulation by the SEC and MSRB. 

BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, collateralized debt obligations (&#8220;CDOs&#8221;), collateralized loan obligations (&#8220;CLOs&#8221;), real estate funds, collective investment trusts, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rule-making or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators in this area. 

Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to ERISA, and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DoL, insofar as they act as a &#8220;fiduciary&#8221; under Title I of ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require certain BlackRock entities to carry bonds insuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to non-benefit plan clients. 

BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators (&#8220;CPOs&#8221;) and/or commodity trading advisors (&#8220;CTAs&#8221;) with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of the DFA, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. Two of BlackRock&#8217;s other subsidiaries, BlackRock Investments, LLC (&#8220;BRIL&#8221;) and BlackRock Execution Services, are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer&#8217;s permitted activities. BRIL is also an approved person with the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) and a member of the MSRB, subject to MSRB rules. 

U.S. Banking Regulation 

PNC is a bank holding company and regulated as a &#8220;financial holding company&#8221; by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;). As described in &#8220;Item 1-Business&#8221;, as of December 31, 2015 PNC owned approximately 22% of BlackRock&#8217;s capital stock. Based on the Federal Reserve&#8217;s interpretation of the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve currently takes the position that this ownership interest causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the BHC Act, thereby subjecting BlackRock to banking regulation, including the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve and to most banking laws, regulations and orders that apply to PNC, including the Volcker Rule. The supervision and regulation of PNC and its subsidiaries under applicable banking laws are intended primarily for the protection of its banking subsidiaries, its depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the financial system as a whole, rather than for the protection of stockholders, creditors or clients of PNC or BlackRock. 

BlackRock generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a financial holding company under the BHC Act. Investment management is an authorized activity, but must be conducted within applicable regulatory requirements, which in some cases are more restrictive than those BlackRock faces under applicable securities laws. BlackRock may also invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory, administrative or other services, only to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory interpretations. Based on the Federal Reserve&#8217;s position that BlackRock is a nonbank subsidiary of PNC, the Federal Reserve has broad powers to approve, deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices for BlackRock to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets, or reconfigure existing operations, and there are limits on the ability of bank subsidiaries of PNC to extend credit to or conduct other transactions with BlackRock or its funds. PNC and its subsidiaries are also subject to examination by various banking regulators, which results in examination reports and ratings that may adversely impact the conduct and growth of BlackRock&#8217;s businesses. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over nonbank subsidiaries, including the power to prohibit them from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking laws, regulations and orders. The DFA strengthened the Federal Reserve&#8217;s supervisory and enforcement authority over a bank holding company&#8217;s nonbank subsidiaries. 

Any failure of PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. Such a change of status could be caused by any failure of PNC or one of PNC&#8217;s bank subsidiaries to remain &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed,&#8221; by any examination downgrade of one of PNC&#8217;s bank subsidiaries, or by any failure of one of PNC&#8217;s bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. 

One of BlackRock&#8217;s subsidiaries, BTC, is organized as a limited purpose national trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans. BTC is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as capital adequacy, regulations governing fiduciaries, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. BTC is also subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC&#8217;s customers and not BTC, BlackRock and its affiliates, or BlackRock&#8217;s stockholders. 

Regulation of Securities Lending Financing Transactions

In its 2014 Annual Report, the FSOC identified securities lending indemnification by asset managers who act as lending agents as a potential systemic risk that required further review and monitoring. The Federal Reserve is also considering whether to impose specific margin or minimum haircut requirements for securities financing transactions (&#8220;SFTs&#8221;). In addition, in October 2015, the European Parliament adopted the European Commission&#8217;s proposal for a European regulation on the reporting and transparency of SFTs. The SFT regulation aims to improve the transparency surrounding SFTs and limit the perceived risks of SFTs by, among other things, requiring central reporting of SFTs, requiring disclosure of SFTs to investors and imposing minimum requirements relating to the difference in prices at which a market maker can buy and sell a security in SFTs. If the recent scrutiny of SFTs results in additional regulatory requirements or reporting obligations, BlackRock may be 

required to introduce additional compliance measures, which will subject BlackRock to additional expenses and could lead to modifications in BlackRock&#8217;s SFT activities, including po tential adjustments to its activities as agent lender for its clients . 

EXISTING INTERNATIONAL REGULATION &#8212; OVERVIEW 

BlackRock&#8217;s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of international jurisdictions, as well as oversight by numerous regulatory agencies and bodies in those jurisdictions. In some instances, these operations are also affected by U.S. laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application. 

Below is a summary of certain international regulatory standards to which BlackRock is subject. It is not meant to be comprehensive as there are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many jurisdictions where BlackRock&#8217;s subsidiaries conduct business. 

Of note among the various other international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and complex regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. 

European Regulation 

The FCA currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;). It also regulates those U.K. subsidiaries&#8217; branches established in other European Union countries and the U.K. branches of certain of BlackRock&#8217;s U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, the Prudential Regulation Authority (&#8220;PRA&#8221;) regulates one BlackRock U.K. insurance subsidiary. Authorization by the FCA and (where relevant) the PRA is required to conduct certain financial services related business in the U.K. under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the &#8220;FSMA&#8221;). The FCA&#8217;s rules adopted under the FSMA govern the majority of a firm&#8217;s capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients, and systems and controls, whereas the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements that apply to BlackRock&#8217;s U.K.-regulated insurance subsidiary. The FCA supervises BlackRock&#8217;s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and thematic based reviews in order to monitor BlackRock&#8217;s compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA&#8217;s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against BlackRock&#8217;s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and/or its employees. 

In addition, BlackRock&#8217;s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and other European subsidiaries and branches, must comply with the pan-European regulatory regime established by MiFID, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the wider EEA. MiFID, the scope of which is being enhanced through MiFID II (which is described more particularly under &#8220;&#8212; Global Regulatory Reform&#8221; above), sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. Certain BlackRock European subsidiaries must also comply with the Consolidated Life Directive and Insurance Mediation Directive. In addition, relevant entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms (the Capital Requirements Directive). These include requirements on capital, as well as matters of governance and remuneration. The obligations introduced through these directives will have a direct effect on some of BlackRock&#8217;s European operations. 

BlackRock&#8217;s EU-regulated subsidiaries are also subject to an EU regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, which requires (i) the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives, (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives and (iii) the reporting of all derivative contracts since February 2014. 

Regulation in the Asia-Pacific Region 

In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (&#8220;FIEL&#8221;) and the Law Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (&#8220;JFSA&#8221;), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules.
