Lifting Equipment Segment

Boom Trucks

A boom truck is a straight telescopic boom crane outfitted with a hook and winch which is mounted on a standard flatbed commercial (Class 7 or 8) truck chassis. Relative to other lifting equipment, boom trucks provide increased versatility and are capable of transporting relatively large payloads from site to site at highway speeds. A boom truck is usually sold with outriggers, pads and devices for reinforcing the chassis in order to improve safety and stability. Although produced in a wide range of models and sizes, boom trucks can be broadly distinguished by their normal lifting capability as light, medium, and heavy-cranes. Various models of medium or heavy-lift boom trucks can safely lift loads from 15 to 70 tons and operating radii can exceed 200 feet. Another advantage of the boom truck is the ability to provide occasional man lift capabilities at a very low cost to height ratio. While it is not uncommon to see a very old boom truck, most replacement cycles seem to trend to seven years. The market for boom trucks has historically been cyclical. 

Although the Company offers a complete line of boom trucks from light to heavy capacity cranes much of our efforts have been devoted to the development of higher capacity boom trucks specifically designed to meet the particular needs of customers including those in energy production and power distribution. We believe it is an advantage to be skewed towards the heavier lifting capacity, since the heavier capacity cranes have somewhat higher margins. 

Markets that drive demand for boom trucks include power distribution, oil and gas recovery, infrastructure and new home, commercial and industrial construction. The new home construction market, which uses lower capacity cranes, is probably the most cyclical. 

The Company sells its boom trucks through a network of over forty full service dealers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, South America, and the Middle East. A number of our dealers maintain a rental fleet of their own. Boom trucks can be rented for either short or long-term periods. 

In 2011, the overall market for boom trucks strengthened considerably. It was, however, still considerably below previous market peaks. In 2011, Company unit sales i ncreased approximately 60%. The Company believes its 2011 percent unit sales growth was lower than the overall industry growth in 2011. Much of the industry&#8217;s unit sales growth occurred in the lower lifting capacity boom truck segment, a market segment whe re we traditionally have our lowest market share. 

In 2012, the market for boom trucks again showed considerable improvement with total industry unit sales approaching pre-2008 levels. The market dynamics were, however, considerably different than they previously were. Much of the current demand then was being driven by niche market sectors, i.e., oil and gas exploration and power line construction. The demand from the general construction market although slowly improving still did not approach pre-2008 levels. For 2012, the Company&#8217;s boom truck unit sales increased by approximately 65% as compared to the prior year. The increase in unit sales reflects the Company&#8217;s strategic initiatives which have emphasized the development of boom trucks with higher lifting capacities that target the oil and gas and power line distribution market segments. 

In 2013, the overall market for boom truck was marginally down from the prior year. However, revenues generated from boom truck sales by the Company increased by approximately 30% in 2013. Accordingly, the Company&#8217;s market share was also up. The revenue increase was principally attributed to an increase in production capacity. This increase in capacity allowed us to reduce the backlog that existed at December 31, 2012 and to more aggressively promote the sale of our lower tonnage cranes. A significant portion of the December 2012 backlog was for higher tonnage cranes used in niche market segments particularly the North American energy sector. During the year, there was a softening in the demand for our products which are related to the energy sector. 

In 2014, the Company saw a decline in orders for cranes with higher lifting capacities that serve niche markets, including the North American energy sector slowdown from prior years, largely as a result of the fall in oil prices. However, demand for lower capacity cranes increased, offsetting the decrease in revenues generated from the sale of cranes with higher lifting capacities. The increase in revenues generated from the sale of cranes with lower lifting capacity is reflective of the continued growth of general construction activity in North America. The change in mix did, however, result in lower gross profit percent for 2014.

In 2015, oil prices continued to decline and the U.S. oil rig count dropped from 1,600 in January 2015 to just over 500 at end of the year. As a result of this decrease in rig count, the oil and gas industry further curtailed purchasing and began selling excess equipment into the general construction market, which further depressed the demand for boom trucks. We have recently observed a slight moderating of the selloff of excess equipment by the energy sector and are hopeful that the selloff of excess equipment by the energy sector will be largely completed by the end of 2016. The aforementioned factors resulted in a significant decrease in revenues during the year from the sale of boom trucks.

PM Group

PM is a leading Italian manufacturer of truck mounted hydraulic knuckle boom cranes with a 50-year history of technology and innovation, and a product range spanning more than 50 models. Its largest subsidiary, Oil &#38; Steel (&#8220;O&#38;S&#8221;), is a manufacturer of truck-mounted aerial platforms with a diverse product line

PM knuckle boom cranes are hydraulic folding and articulating cranes, mounted on a commercial chassis, with lifting capacities that range from small (lifting capacity up to three ton meter) to super heavy (lifting capacity two hundred and ten ton meter), often supplied with a jib for additional reach. With a compact design and footprint, the crane can be mounted to maximize the load carrying capability of the chassis onto which it is mounted. Combined with the cranes ability to operate in a compact footprint the ability to carry a payload provides a competitive advantage over other truck mounted cranes and makes the knuckle boom crane particularly attractive for a variety of end uses in the construction and product delivery sectors.

The knuckle boom crane market is a global market with a wide variety of end sector applications, but focused particularly on residential and non-residential construction, road and bridge and infrastructure development. Historically the knuckle boom crane has not had significant application in the energy sector. PM knuckle boom cranes are sold into a variety of geographies including West and East Europe, Central Asia, Africa, North and Central America, South America, the Middle East and the Far East and Pacific region. Historically, PM focused on its domestic and local Western European markets, but in recent years has expanded its sales and distribution efforts internationally. PM has ten international sales and distribution offices located in several European countries as well as the Far East and Latin America. During 2015, after acquisition by Manitex, the Company expanded its distribution capability with the existing Manitex dealer network in North America as well as expanding the number of independent service centers in the US.

The market for knuckle boom cranes has been growing in recent years as the acceptability of the product has grown and its advantages have been accepted. Growth in North America where the straight mast boom truck crane has been the more dominant product has been more rapid in recent years in combination with the overall improvement in the North American construction sector. PM Group share of the North American market has been historically low; however this is an area of growth opportunity for the Company following its acquisition by Manitex.

PM a erial platforms are self-propelled or truck mounted and places an operator in a basket in the air in order to perform maintenance, repairs or similar activities. The equipment is used in a variety of applications including utilities, sign work and industri al maintenance and is often sold to rental operations. PM group product serves in a number of geographies in West and East Europe but also the near and Far East and sells through dealers as well as its own sales and distribution offices. The market general ly follows the domestic economic cycle for any particular country. Consequently, the market has shown a positive trend in the recent past as European economies recover from the 2009 / 2010 economic crisis. 

Industrial Cranes

Our Badger subsidiary sells specialized industrial cranes through a network of dealers. The Badger product line includes specialized 15 and 30 ton industrial cranes (which can be used by the railroads) as well as a 10 ton carry deck crane which are all sold under both the Badger and Manitex names. Additionally, Badger sells lattice cranes with 20 to 30 ton lifting capacity marketed under the Little Giant trade name. The Little Giant line has five lattice boom models, three of which are dedicated rail cranes. In addition, Badger also sells a 30 ton truck crane and a 25 ton crawler crane under the Little Giant name. Badger also has the capability to manufacture certain of our lower capacity boom trucks and provides expanded boom truck manufacturing capacity when needed.

The products are used by railroads, refineries, states, municipalities, and for general construction. The Company believes it has an advantage over its competitors in selling to railroads as it is the only crane manufacturer that has integrated the installation of rail gear into its production process. Competitors send their cranes to a third party to have rail gear added which both increases cost and delays deliveries. 

Our Valla product line of industrial cranes is a full range of precision pick and carries cranes from 2 to 90 tons, using electric, diesel, and hybrid power options. Its cranes offer wheeled or tracked, and fixed or swing boom configurations, with special applications designed specifically to meet the needs of its customers. The product is sold internationally through dealers and into the rental distribution channel. 

Rough Terrain Forklifts 

Manitex Liftking manufactures a complete range of straight mast forklifts with capacities from 6,000 to 50,000 lbs. and lift heights from 10 to 32 feet. All Manitex Liftking straight mast forklifts feature exceptional ground clearance, easy access to service points, ergonomic controls and easy operation. The Company also produces a series of tag along forklifts that mount to trucks with lifting capacity ranging from 4,000 to 6,000 pounds. These mounted forklifts are ideal for bricklaying, landscaping, construction or any other application that requires a forklift to tag along. The forklifts feature an easy to mount system, which allows an operator to securely mount or dismount the forklift quickly. 

Manitex Liftking forklifts include four rough terrain forklifts, in several configurations, which are sold under the Noble trade name. The Noble product line was originally designed and marketed by Caterpillar. Noble has a reputation for providing durable, innovative and high quality products. The Noble rough terrain forklifts are currently distributed through the Caterpillar dealer network. 

The Company sells its rough terrain forklifts through a network of dealers in the United States and Canada. 

Military Forklifts 

Manitex Liftking military forklifts are used worldwide during both periods of conflict and peace. Manitex Liftking military units are working for national militaries including the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. The Company&#8217;s exported military products (including products sold to the U.S.) are sold through the Canadian Commercial Corporation which has direct contracts with various foreign (outside of Canada) government agencies. The U.S. Department of Defense alone has hundreds of Manitex Liftking vehicles in the Navy, Army and Air Force that they depend on daily. These vehicles range from small shipboard approved forklifts to the biggest articulating, rough-terrain forklift in the world. 

Manitex Liftking military forklifts have innovative features that allow them to meet strict military standards and perform in almost any terrain. These features include the patented hydraulically removable counterweight that permits aircraft transportability of the forklift without exceeding the load limits of the aircraft. The water fording capability of some Manitex Liftking vehicles allow continuous operation in water depths of up to 5 feet (1.5 meters), providing true all-terrain operation. The Company believes that these features have helped position Manitex Liftking as the product of choice for rough terrain military forklifts. 

All of Manitex Liftking&#8217;s shipboard approved vehicles are structurally engineered to withstand a depth charge explosion while on an aircraft carrier, and still be fully operational. The detachable mast and 2-piece operator&#8217;s cab on some of Manitex Liftking&#8217;s bigger vehicles allow easy disassembly to satisfy height restrictions while being transported by road or rail. Attachments such as fork rollers and standard ISO container handlers further increase the versatility of a Manitex Liftking forklift. 

Manitex Liftking&#8217;s forklifts are built to exacting military standards including compliance with the quality controls required by ISO 9001-2008. Before being shipped each machine is thoroughly tested on a military approved endurance track located adjacent to Manitex Liftking&#8217;s military vehicle manufacturing plant. There are a limited number of test tracks in North America, and having a military approved test track is an advantage. 

The timing of customer orders can be expected to result in fluctuations in revenues from period to period. The expected fluctuations, however, are not as dependent on general economic conditions as is our commercial business. The Company currently has a backlog of $5.8 million, which is expected to be filled in 2016. The Company currently has four open military contracts that provides for purchases up to approximately $100 million between now and 2019. The future sales are, however, dependent on the receipt of future orders against these four open military contracts. 

Mission Oriented Vehicles and Specialized Carriers

The Company has the capability to design, and manufacture special mission oriented vehicles and specialized carriers which are designed and built to meet unique customer needs and requirements. The Company&#8217;s specialized lifting equipment has met the particular needs of customers in various industries including utility, ship building and steel mill industries. Due to the unique nature of these products, the Company only receives orders for this type of product infrequently and in limited quantities. Mission oriented vehicles and specialized carriers are sold directly to the end users.

Transporters, used in ship building, are one example of a specialized carrier built by Manitex Liftking. The ship builder will construct a segment of the hull on our transporter. When the section of the hull is complete, the ship builder will move the section to the already completed portion of the hull and attach it. Manitex Liftking has built transporters capable of transporting 500,000 pounds.

Container Handling Equipment 

The Company through its Italian subsidiary, CVS Ferrari, srl (&#8220;CVS&#8221;) manufactures a range of container handling equipment to serve ports and inter-modal customers on a worldwide basis. CVS owns rights and designs to manufacture a variety of products, including reach stackers, empty container handlers, forklift, straddle carriers, and tractors. 

The container handling market is a somewhat cyclical market, which is impacted by both general economic conditions as well as the timing of major port construction projects. Although demand is impacted by general economic conditions, a significant portion of the funding for purchases comes from governments or governmental agencies, which may be less sensitive to general economic conditions. The effect of an economic downturn may also be delayed as there are long-lead times for major contracts, which may be received prior to the deterioration of economic conditions. 

While CVS&#8217;s sales have historically been in Italy and other European countries, it has also historically had a market presence in Africa, South America, the Middle East and the Far East. In recent years CVS has devoted efforts to expand its international presence. In 2013 CVS added new dealers in Latin America that began to generate additional revenues starting in the second half of 2013. During 2015, the Company executed a dealership agreement with a Canadian dealer that serves the North American Market. In its markets, CVS competes with several other companies, including three companies that are significantly larger than CVS. In attempting to expand its presence in the North American market, CVS faces competition from these competitors and also domestic manufacturers. 

As discussed above, CVS during the last two years has continued to expand its dealer network and has also benefited from a modest increase in demand in its local Italian market.

Mobile Tanks

Manitex Sabre manufactures a comprehensive line of specialized mobile tanks for liquid and solid storage and containment solutions with capacities from 8,000 to 21,000 gallons. Its mobile tanks are sold to specialized independent tank rental companies and through the Company&#8217;s existing dealer network.

The tanks have historically been used in variety of end markets such as petrochemical, waste management and oil and gas drilling. However, when we purchased Sabre in 2013, their business heavily skewed towards the energy sector. Since early 2014, we have been working to diversify the products, customers, and applications. This includes expanding environmental applications and using our tanks to store deicer fluid at airports. 

ASV Segment 

Loaders and Skid Steer

ASV manufactures and sells a complete range of compact rubber tracked loaders (CTL) and skid steer loaders (SSL). Our CTLs with rated operating capacity between 700 pound and 3,500 pounds are used in the site clearing, general construction, forestry, golf course maintenance and landscaping industries, with general construction being the largest market. The CTL manufactured by ASV has several patented features and unique attributes, including the only available rubber tracked undercarriage system. CTLs equipped with the available rubber tracked undercarriage system significantly minimize or reduce damages to the surface (ground) on which it is operating. Our SSLs with rated operating capacity between 1,600 pound and 3,200 pounds are used in general construction, material handling, including scrap and waste, and agricultural markets. 

When we acquired our interest in ASV, the products were only marketed under the Terex brand and sold exclusively through the Terex distribution network. Since then, we have reintroduced the ASV brand to the marketplace and have entered into dealership agreements with independent dealers. Presently, these dealers have more than 100 locations to serve customers. The Company continues and will continue to sell Terex branded products and will continue sell through the Terex distribution network. 

Equipment Distribution Segment

The Equipment Distribution segment comprises the operations of Crane &#38; Machinery (&#8220;C&#38;M&#8221;), a division of Manitex International, North American Equipment, Inc. (&#8220;NAE&#8221;) and North American Distribution, Inc. (&#8220;NAD&#8221;). The segment markets products used primarily for infrastructure development and commercial construction applications that include road and bridge construction, general contracting, roofing, scrap handling and sign construction and maintenance. C&#38;M is a distributor of Terex rough terrain and truck cranes products and supplies repair parts for a wide variety of medium to heavy duty construction equipment and sells domestically and internationally, predominately to end users, including the rental market. It also provides crane equipment repair services in the Chicago area. The segment markets previously-owned construction and heavy equipment and trailers both domestically and internationally through NAE. NAE purchases previously owned equipment of various ages and conditions and often refurbishes the equipment before resale. The segment also sells Valla products through NAD. 

Revenues attributable to the Company&#8217;s Equipment Distribution segment were less than 10% of the Company&#8217;s total revenues for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

Part Sales

Each of our segments supplies repair and replacement parts for its products. The parts business margins are higher than our overall margins. Part sales as a percentage of revenues tend to increase when there is a down-turn in the industry. Part sales as a percentage of revenues is approximately 15%, 11% and 15% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

In 2015, 2014 and 2013, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company&#8217;s revenue. 

Raw Materials 

The Company purchases a variety of components used in the production of its products. The Company purchases steel and a variety of machined parts, components and subassemblies including weldments, winches, cylinders, frames, rims, axles, wheels, tires, suspensions, cables, booms and cabs, as well as engines, transmissions and cabs. Additionally, Manitex and PM mount their cranes on commercial truck chassis, which are either purchased by the Company or supplied by the customer. Lead times for these materials (including chassis) vary from several weeks to many months. The Company is vulnerable to a supply interruption in instances when only one supplier has been qualified and identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers can be very time consuming, and in some cases, could take longer than a year. The Company has been working on qualifying secondary sources of some products to assure supply consistency and to reduce costs. The degree to which our supply base can respond to changes in market demand directly affects our ability to increase production and the Company attempts to maintain some additional inventory in order to react to unexpected increases in demand. During 2013, 2014 and 2015, raw materials and components were generally available to meet our production schedules and had no significant impact on full year revenues. During the first part of 2014 delivery of chassis for our larger cranes had a modest impact on production, however this was alleviated during the year as manufacturers increased their production and demand also slowed compared to the first half of the year.

Any future supply chain issues that might impact the Company will in part depend on how fast the rate of growth is for a product as well as the rate of growth in the general economy. Strong general economic growth could put us in competition for parts with other industries. Additionally, events or circumstance at a particular supplier could impact the availability of a necessary component.

Patents and Trademarks

The Company protects its trade names and trademarks through registration. Its technology consists of bill of materials, drawings, plans, vendor sources and specifications and although the Company&#8217;s technology has considerable value, it does not generally have patent protection. The Company has (on rare occasions) filed for patent protection on a specific feature. In the future, the Company will consider seeking patent protection on any new design features believed to present a significant future benefit.

The Company owns and uses several trademarks relating to its brands that have significant value and are instrumental to the Company&#8217;s ability to market its products. The Company&#8217;s most significant trademarks are its mark &#8220;Manitex&#8221; (presently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office until 2017), and its mark &#8220;LIFTKING&#8221; (presently registered with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office). Badger Equipment Company markets its products under the &#8220;Little Giant&#8221; and Badger trade names. The Company&#8217;s PM Group subsidiary sells its products using the trademark &#8220;PM&#8221; and PM Group&#8217;s O&#38;S subsidiary sells its products using the &#8220;OIL &#38; STEEL&#8221; trademark. The Manitex, Liftking, Badger, Little Giant, PM and OIL &#38; STEEL trademarks and trade names are important to the marketing and operation of the Company&#8217;s business as a significant number of our products are sold under those names. The use of the trade name &#8220;Noble&#8221; is also important to the Company&#8217;s business. Although the Company does not own the Noble trade name, it has the right to use the Noble name in connection with its rough terrain forklift product line. ASV product is marketed under the Terex trade name to which it has a license, and also under the ASV trade name. Other important trademarks that are registered by ASV include &#8220;Posi-Track&#8221;, &#8220;Loegering&#8221; VTS and VTS Versatile Track System. ASV has a number of patents for its current machines presently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office until 2023 and the original patent for now discontinued machines that expires in 2018. PM Group&#8217;s O&#38;S subsidiary has three patents. One is registered with the Italian Patents and Trademarks Office until 2028. O&#38;S has two additional patents registered with OHIM that are inforce until 2031 and 2034, respectively.

Seasonality

Traditionally, the Company&#8217;s peak selling periods for cranes and commercial rough terrain forklifts are the second and third quarters of a calendar year as a result of the need for equipment in the spring, summer and fall construction seasons. A significant portion of cranes sold over the last several years have been deployed in specialized industries or applications, such as oil and gas production, power distribution and in the railroad industry. Sales in these market segments are subject to significant fluctuations which correlate more with general economic conditions and the prices of commodities, including oil, and generally are not of a seasonal nature. 

The Lifting Equipment segment&#8217;s military, special mission oriented vehicles and specialized carriers business is dependent on both the receipt of customers&#8217; orders and the timing of contract awards related to major port projects. The timing of customer orders can be expected to result in non-seasonal fluctuations in revenues from period to period. 

Sales of cranes from the Equipment Distribution segment mirror the seasonality of the overall Company. However, the sale of parts is much less seasonal given the geographic breadth of the customer base. Crane repairs are performed by the Equipment Distribution segment throughout the year but are somewhat affected by the slowdown in construction activity during the typically harsh winters in the Midwestern United States.

Peak sales of ASV products are traditionally in the first half of a calendar year as a result of the need to have new equipment available for the spring, summer and fall construction seasons, although this i s partially offset by sales to export markets in the southern hemisphere. The financial crisis that began in 2008 dramatically depressed demand for products used in commercial construction and home building, the market areas subject to the greatest seasona lity. As such, the seasonal impact on ASV&#8217;s business has not as significant in recent years. 

Competition

Lifting Equipment Segment

The market for the Company&#8217;s boom trucks and knuckle boom cranes, commercial rough terrain forklifts, container handling equipment and trailers is highly competitive. The Company competes based on product design, quality of products and services, product performance, maintenance costs and price. Several competitors have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and distribution resources than we do. The Company believes that it effectively competes with its competitors.

Military forklifts, special mission oriented vehicles and specialized carriers are highly engineered products and, therefore, only face limited competition. The Company&#8217;s rough terrain cranes serve smaller niche markets and, therefore, also have less competition.

The Company&#8217;s boom cranes compete with cranes manufactured by National Crane, Terex, Weldco Beales, Elliott and Altec. The Company&#8217;s knuckle boom cranes compete with Palfinger, Fassi, Effer and HIAB. The Company competes with Linamar, Sellick, Harlo, Manitou, Mastercraft and Load Lifter in selling rough terrain forklifts. The Company competes primarily with Terex and Broderson in selling rough terrain and industrial cranes. The Company&#8217;s container handling equipment competes with similar equipment sold by Cargotec, Konecranes and Terex. 

ASV Segment

The Company&#8217;s compact and skid steer loaders compete with product manufactured and sold by Bobcat (part of Doosan), Caterpillar, CNH, Gehl, Takeuchi, John Deere and Wacker Neuson.

Equipment Distribution Segment

Our Equipment Distribution segment has a dealership arrangement with Terex and must compete against dealers of other rough terrain and truck crane manufacturers such as Imperial Crane (Tadano and Elliot) and Walter Payton Power (Grove) who operate in the same geographic market in and around Chicago. The same dynamic holds true in selling Manitex boom trucks which are part of our Lifting Equipment segment. The Equipment Distribution segment competes against Runnion Equipment (dealer for National Crane), Power Equipment Leasing (dealer for Elliott) and Guiffre Cranes (dealer for Terex boom trucks). Runnion is also authorized to sell Manitex boom trucks. Our Equipment Distribution segment competes with other PM dealers for distribution in North America.

While no geographic limitations exist regarding the Equipment Distribution segment&#8217;s ability to sell cranes internationally, the lack of any barriers to entry and the heavy use of the Internet make this a highly active and competitive market in which to distribute cranes.

Competition for our Equipment Distribution segment&#8217;s repair business is even more intense since it is limited geographically due to the necessity of having physical access to the cranes. Most of the above referenced companies also compete in this aspect of the business, as do other types of crane and equipment dealers from nearby areas such as Indiana or Wisconsin.

Parts sales from the Equipment Distribution segment are global in scope and benefit greatly from the Internet and the tenure and expertise of our employees. While competition in this area is extensive, the breadth of the products offered and the segment&#8217;s long history in this part of the business is we believe a competitive advantage.

The Distribution segment also markets previously-owned construction and heavy equipment, domestically and internationally. We provide a wide range of used lifting and construction equipment of various ages and condition. The sale of used equipment is highly competitive as other dealers, rental companies, and end users also sell used equipment. The Distribution Equipment segment has a competitive advantage as it has broad product offering and has the capability to refurbish the equipment to the customers&#8217; specification. 

The Equipment Distribution segment competes based on the design, quality and performance of the products it distributes, price and the supporting repair and part services that it provides. Several competitors have greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. The Company, however, believes that it effectively competes with its competitors.

Backlog 

The backlog at December 31, 2015 was approximately $82.5 million, compared to a backlog of approximately $98.2 million (restated to exclude Load King) at December 31, 2014. The Company expects to ship product to fulfill its existing backlog within the next twelve months.

Research and Development

The Company spent $5.8 million, $2.1 million and $2.3 million on company-sponsored research and development activities for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
