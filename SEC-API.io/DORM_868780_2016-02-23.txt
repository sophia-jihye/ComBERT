 Item 1. Business. 

General 

Dorman Products, Inc. was incorporated in Pennsylvania in October 1978. As used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, &#147;Dorman&#148;, the &#147;Company&#148;, &#147;we&#148;, &#147;us&#148;, or &#147;our&#148; refers to Dorman Products, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 

We are a leading supplier of replacement parts and fasteners for passenger cars, light trucks, and heavy duty trucks in the automotive aftermarket. We distribute and market approximately 150,000 different stock keeping units (&#147;SKU&#146;s&#148;) of automotive replacement parts and fasteners, many of which we design and engineer. We believe we are the dominant aftermarket supplier of original equipment &#147;dealer exclusive&#148; items. Original equipment &#147;dealer exclusive&#148; items are those which were traditionally available to consumers only from original equipment manufacturers or used parts from salvage yards and include, among other parts, intake manifolds, exhaust manifolds, window regulators, radiator fan assemblies, tire pressure monitor sensors, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) coolers and complex electronics modules. Fasteners include such items as oil drain plugs, wheel bolts, and wheel lug nuts. Approximately 84% of our products are sold under brands that we own and the remainder of our products are sold for resale under customers&#146; private labels, other brands or in bulk. Our products are sold primarily in the United States through automotive aftermarket retailers (such as Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone, and O&#146;Reilly Auto Parts), national, regional and local warehouse distributors (such as Genuine Parts Co. - NAPA) and specialty markets, and salvage yards. We also distribute automotive replacement parts internationally, with sales primarily into Europe, Mexico, the Middle East, Asia and Canada. 

The Automotive Aftermarket 

The automotive replacement parts market is made up of two components: parts for passenger cars and light trucks, which accounted for projected industry sales of approximately $266 billion in 2015 1 , and parts for medium and heavy duty trucks, which accounted for projected industry sales of approximately $85 billion in 2015 1 . We market products primarily for passenger cars and light trucks, including those with diesel engines and, more recently, for medium and heavy duty trucks. Two distinct groups of end-users buy replacement vehicle (automotive and truck) parts: (i) individual consumers, who purchase parts to perform &#147;do-it-yourself&#148; repairs on their own vehicles; and (ii) professional installers, which include vehicle repair shops and the dealership service departments. The individual consumer market is typically supplied through retailers and through the retail arms of warehouse distributors. Vehicle repair shops generally purchase parts through local independent parts wholesalers and through national parts distributors. Automobile dealership service departments generally obtain parts through the distribution systems of vehicle manufacturers and specialized national and regional parts distributors. 

Spending in the light vehicle aftermarket can be generally grouped into three categories: discretionary, maintenance and repair. Discretionary, such as accessories and performance, tends to move in-line with consumer discretionary spending. Maintenance is composed of products and services, such as oil and oil changes, and tends to be less correlated with discretionary spending. The repair category consists mainly of replacement parts which fail over time and tends to be less cyclical as it is largely comprised of parts necessary for a vehicle to function properly or safely. The majority of our products fall into the repair category. The increasing complexity of automobiles and the number of different makes and models of automobiles have resulted in a significant increase in the number of products required to service the domestic and foreign automotive fleet. Accordingly, the number of parts required to be carried by retailers and wholesale distributors has increased substantially. The requirement to include more products in inventory and the significant consolidation among distributors of automotive replacement parts have in turn resulted in larger distributors. 

Retailers and others who purchase aftermarket automotive repair and replacement parts for resale are constrained to a finite amount of space in which to display and stock products. Thus, the reputation for quality, customer service, and line profitability which a supplier enjoys are significant factors in a purchaser&#146;s decision as to which product lines to carry in the limited space available. Further, because of the efficiencies achieved through the ability to order all or part of a complete line of products from one supplier (with possible volume discounts), as opposed to satisfying the same requirements through a variety of different sources, retailers and other purchasers of automotive parts seek to purchase products from fewer but stronger suppliers.

OE Fix products are designed to solve the original problem, save time and money for our end users, and create &#147;customers for life.&#148; 

&#160;

We also generate revenues from the sale of parts that we package for ourselves, or others, for sale in bulk or under the private labels of parts manufacturers and national warehouse distributors (such as Genuine Parts Co. - NAPA). 

We group our products into four major classes: power-train, automotive body, chassis, and hardware. The following table represents each of the four classes as a percentage of net sales for each of the last three fiscal years:

Our line of automotive body products include door handles and hinges, window lift motors, window regulators, switches and handles, wiper components, lighting, electrical, and other interior and exterior automotive body components. Chassis products include brake 

&#160;

hardware and hydraulics, wheel and axle hardware, suspension arms, knuckles, links, bushings, and other suspension, steering and brake components. Hardware products include threaded bolts, auto body and home fasteners, automotive and home electrical wiring components, and other hardware assortments and merchandise. 

We warrant our products against certain defects in material and workmanship when used as designed on the vehicle on which it was originally installed. We offer a limited lifetime warranty on most of our products. Our warranty limits the customer&#146;s remedy to the repair or replacement of the part that is defective. 

Product Development 

Product development is central to our business. The development of a broad range of products, many of which are not conveniently or economically available elsewhere, has in part, enabled us to grow to our present size and is important to our future growth. In developing our products, our strategy has been to design and package parts so as to make them better and easier to install and/or use than the original parts they replace and to sell automotive parts for the broadest possible range of uses. New product ideas are reviewed by our product management staff, as well as by members of the production, sales, finance, marketing, legal, and administrative staffs. The following table represents the number of unique parts we introduced for each of the last three fiscal years: 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 4,852 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,742 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,460 &#160; Through careful evaluation, exacting design and precise tooling, we are frequently able to offer products which fit a broader range of makes and models, as well as a wider range of application years than the original equipment parts they replace. One such innovation is our replacement spare tire hoist, which through several mechanical design changes allow us to offer a part that replaces three original equipment parts, and now fits common domestic models over a thirteen year range. By selecting an appropriate micro controller and making other customizations, our Xenon headlight control module fits a range of domestic models from GM and Chrysler, as well as models from BMW, Mercedes Benz, Volkswagen and Volvo. This flexibility assists retailers and other purchasers in maximizing the productivity of the limited space available for each class of part sold. Further, where possible, we improve our parts so that they are better than the parts they replace. Finally, we make every attempt to look at the repair through the eyes of the end user, and redesign many of our items to make installation easier. In addition, we often package different items in complete kits to further aid installation. 

Ideas for expansion of our product lines arise through a variety of sources. We maintain an in-house product management staff that routinely generates ideas for new parts and the expansion of existing lines. Further, we maintain an &#147;800&#148; telephone number and an Internet site for &#147;New Product Ideas&#148; and receive, either through our sales force, product development team or our website, many ideas from our customers and end-users as to which types of presently unavailable parts the ultimate consumers are seeking. 

Sales and Marketing 

We market our products to three groups of purchasers who in turn supply individual consumers and professional installers. Based on net sales to our customers as of December 26, 2015: 

(i) approximately 48% of our revenues were generated from sales to automotive aftermarket retailers (such as, Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone and O&#146;Reilly Auto Parts), local independent parts wholesalers and national general merchandise chain retailers. We sell many of our products to virtually all major chains of automotive aftermarket retailers; 

(ii) approximately 46% of our revenues were generated from sales to automotive parts distributors (such as Genuine Parts Co. - NAPA), which may be local, regional or national in scope, and which may also engage in retail sales; and 

(iii) the balance of our revenues (approximately 6%) are generated from international sales and sales to special markets, which include, among others, mass merchants (such as Wal-Mart), salvage yards and the parts distribution systems of parts manufacturers. 

We use a number of different methods to sell our products. Our more than 60 person direct sales force and sales support staff solicits purchases of our products directly from customers, as well as manages the activities of approximately 27 independent manufacturers&#146; representative agencies worldwide. We use independent manufacturers&#146; representative agencies to help service existing automotive retail, automotive and heavy duty parts distribution customers, providing frequent on-site contact. We increase 

&#160;

sales by securing new customers, by adding new product lines and expanding product selection within existing customers. For certain of our major customers, and our private label purchasers, we rely primarily upon the direct efforts of our sales force who, together with our marketing department and our executive officers, coordinate the more complex pricing and ordering requirements of these accounts. 

Our sales efforts are not directed merely at selling individual products, but rather more broadly towards selling groups of related products that can be displayed on attractive Dorman-designed display systems, thereby maximizing each customer&#146;s ability to present our product line within the confines of the available area. 

We prepare a number of on-line catalogs, application guides and training materials designed to describe our products and other applications as well as to train our customers&#146; sales teams in the promotion and sale of our products. Catalogs of all our parts are available on our website. 

We currently service more than 2,300 active accounts. During fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, four customers (Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone, Genuine Parts Co. - NAPA and O&#146;Reilly Auto Parts) each accounted for more than 10% of net sales and in the aggregate accounted for 60% of net sales in each of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 and 57% of net sales in fiscal 2013. 

Manufacturing 

Substantially all of our products are manufactured by third parties. Because numerous manufacturers are available to manufacture our products, we are not dependent upon the services of any one manufacturer or any small group of them. No one manufacturer supplies more than 10% of our products. In fiscal 2015, as a percentage of our total dollar volume of purchases, approximately 29% of our products were purchased from various suppliers throughout the United States and the balance of our products were purchased directly from vendors in a variety of foreign countries. 

Once a new product has been identified, our engineering department produces detailed proprietary engineering drawings, specifications, and prototypes which are used to solicit bids for manufacture from a variety of vendors in the United States and abroad. After a vendor is selected, the vendor produces tooling which we then own. A pilot run of the product is produced and subjected to rigorous testing by our engineering department and, on occasion, by outside testing laboratories and facilities in order to evaluate the precision of manufacture and the resiliency and structural integrity of the materials used. If acceptable, the product then moves into full production. 

Packaging, Inventory and Shipping 

Finished products are received at one or more of our facilities, depending on the type of part. It is our practice to inspect samples of shipments based upon vendor performance. If cleared, these shipments of finished parts are logged into our computerized production tracking systems and staged for packaging, if necessary. 

We employ a variety of custom-designed packaging machines which include blister sealing, skin film sealing, clamshell sealing, bagging and boxing lines. Packaged product contains our label (or a private label), a part number, a universal packaging bar code suitable for electronic scanning, a description of the part and, if appropriate, installation instructions. Products are also sold in bulk to automotive parts manufacturers and packagers. Computerized tracking systems, mechanical counting devices and experienced workers combine to assure that the proper variety and numbers of parts meet the correct packaging materials at the appropriate places and times to produce the required quantities of finished products. 

Completed inventory is stocked in the warehouse portions of our facilities and is organized to facilitate the most efficient methods of retrieving product to fill customer orders. We strive to maintain a level of inventory to adequately meet current customer order demand with additional inventory to satisfy new customer orders and special programs. 

We ship our products from all of our locations by contract carrier, common carrier or parcel service. Products are generally shipped to the customer&#146;s main warehouses for redistribution within their network. In certain circumstances, at the request of the customer, we ship directly to the customer&#146;s warehouses, stores or other locations either via smaller direct ship orders or consolidated store orders that are cross docked. 

Competition 

The replacement automotive parts industry is highly competitive. Various competitive factors affecting the automotive aftermarket are price, product quality, breadth of product line, range of applications and customer service. Substantially all of our products are subject to competition with similar products manufactured by other manufacturers of aftermarket automotive repair and replacement parts. Some of these competitors are divisions and subsidiaries of companies much larger than us, and possess a longer history of operations and greater financial and other resources than we do. We also face competition from automobile manufacturers 

&#160;

who sell through their dealerships many of the same replacement parts that we sell, although these manufacturers generally sell parts only for cars they produce. Our customers may also be successful in sourcing some of our products directly from suppliers. Further, some of our private label customers also compete with us. 

Seasonality 

Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months. In addition, our business can be affected by weather conditions. Extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate. 

Proprietary Rights 

While we take steps to register our trademarks and copyrights when possible, we believe that our business is not heavily dependent on such trademark and copyright registration. Similarly, while we actively seek patent protection for the products and improvements which we develop, we do not believe that patent protection is critical to the success of our business. Rather, the quality, price, customer service and availability of our product is critical to our success. 

Employees 

As noted below, at December 26, 2015, we had 1,846 employees worldwide, essentially all of which were employed full-time. &#147;Operations&#148; consists of employees engaged in production, inventory and quality control. &#147;Product Development&#148; includes employees involved in engineering, product development and purchasing. &#147;Sales&#148; includes employees employed in sales and customer service. &#147;Administration&#148; includes executive officers, finance, legal and human resources. The number of employees will be affected by planned and unplanned open positions at any point in time.
