 Item 1. Business &#160; 

Our Company 

&#160; 

We are an emerging growth technology company that is focused on products, solutions, and services for security on mobile devices. Our core technologies consist of those that support digital payments, biometric identification, encryption, sensors, and miniaturization. We have three distinct lines of business that we are currently pursuing, which are in various stages of development: mobile commerce (&#8220;m-commerce&#8221;), primarily through the application of secure digital payment technologies; biometric access control applications, and Department of Defense contracting. Our initial efforts have primarily focused on the development of our secure products for the growing m-commerce market, most immediately, a secure mobile electronic smart wallet, the Wocket&#174;. The Wocket&#174; is a smart wallet, the next evolution in smart devices following the smartphone and smartwatch, designed to protect your identity and replace all the cards in your wallet, with no smart phone required. The Wocket&#174; works almost everywhere credit cards are accepted. We are also developing a smartcard that functions in a similar manner to the Wocket&#174; and have a distribution agreement with an international direct selling company to distribute that product. Our biometric access control applications and defense contracting opportunities are still in their emerging growths.

&#160;

We believe that our MobileBio&#174; products will provide distinct advantages within m-commerce market by improving mobile security. Currently most mobile devices continue to be protected simply by PIN numbers. This security methodology is easily duplicated on another device, and can easily be spoofed or hacked . Our security paradigm is Dynamic Pairing Codes (&#8220;DPC&#8221;). DPC is a new, proprietary method to secure users, devices, accounts, locations and servers over any communication media by sharing key identifiers, including biometric-enabled identifiers, between end-points by passing dynamic pairing codes (random numbers) between end-points to establish sessions and/or transactions without exposing identifiers or keys. The recent high-level breaches of personal credit card data raises serious concerns among consumers about the safety of their money. These consumers are also resistant to letting technology companies learn even more about their personal purchasing habits.

&#160;

Our plan also anticipates that we will use our core biometric facial and voice recognition algorithms to develop security applications (both cloud based and locally hosted) that can be used for companies (for industrial uses, such as enterprise computer networks) as well as individuals (for consumer uses, such as smart phones, tablets or personal computers), law enforcement, the defense industry, and the U.S. Department of Defense. 

&#160;

We are an emerging growth entity and have incurred net losses since our inception. In order to execute our long-term strategic plan to develop and commercialize our core products and fulfill our product development commitments, we will need to raise additional funds, through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, or other means. We can give no assurance that the cash raised subsequent to December 31, 2015 or any additional funds raised will be sufficient to execute our business plan. Should the Company not be successful in obtaining the necessary financing, or generate sufficient revenue to fund its operations, the Company would need to curtail certain of its operational activities. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We can give no assurance that additional funds will be available on reasonable terms, or available at all, or that it will generate sufficient revenue to alleviate these conditions.

&#160;

Our independent registered public accounting firm&#8217;s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as going concern.

Our Products 

&#160; 

Wocket&#174; 

&#160; 

We have developed a separate physical electronic smart wallet that is intended to hold information from credit cards, debit cards, loyalty cards, identification cards, and virtually any magnetic stripe card to allow the owner of the card to configure a single, dynamic, electronic card to replicate any of the copied cards and thereby reduce the number of physical cards carried in a wallet. As designed, users will simply scan in each card, slide through each of the scanned &#8220;soft-cards&#8221; via a touch screen display. and select the card the user wishes to program. The resultant electronic card can then be swiped just like a regular credit, debit, or virtually any other card. The system consists of 2 devices: an electronic smart wallet &#8220;wocket&#8221; and a dynamic smart card. The electronic smart wallet is secured by an alpha numeric PIN and will also have a range of accessories that allow the user to carry a driver&#8217;s license and cash in the same device, replacing the wallet altogether. The payment information on the wocket smart card is erased a short time after it is enabled so that if the card is lost there is no sensitive information on the card. We commenced shipping of the Wocket&#174; at the end of the second quarter of 2015, primarily to tech savvy consumers. The implementation of the EMV chip point of sale (&#8220;POS&#8221;) terminals in the United States has limited the number of POS systems that the Wocket&#174; works at, so we have postponed the full launch of the product in the United States until we are able to implement Near Field Communication (&#8220;NFC&#8221;) technology on the Wocket&#174; as well as our dynamic magnetic stripe technology. NFC is a similar technology to ApplePay and GooglePay and works at many EMV enabled POS Terminals. We are also pursuing the sale of the Wocket&#174; in certain overseas markets that have not implemented chip cards and where the Wocket&#174; works extremely well. We intend to relaunch the Wocket&#174; in the United States once NFC is operational. Current Wocket&#174; inventory is hardware enabled for this purpose and we are finalizing the software arrangements with banks and major payment companies to implement this technology. We anticipate relaunching the Wocket&#174; in the United States with NFC capability in the third quarter of 2016 and will accelerate efforts to export the product to suitable overseas markets.

World Ventures SmartCard 

&#160;

We have entered into a distribution agreement with WorldVentures Holdings, LLC. (&#8220;WVH&#8221;), an international travel company, who will purchase an exclusive smartcard from the Company for distribution to its membership which is in excess of 500,000 members. WVH also made a strategic investment in the Company. The smartcard will be customized for WorldVentures with additional technologies and wireless features, such as the ability to seamlessly integrate with WorldVentures&#8217;s DreamTrips&#8482; App to wirelessly check in and earn loyalty points towards free DreamTrips vacations at select restaurants. DreamTrips is a travel club and entertainment community where Members enjoy exciting excursions year-round to extraordinary destinations. 

&#160; 

The prototype is expected to be completed in May 2016 with deliveries commencing in July 2016. We have received an initial purchase order for $15 million for delivery in 2016. The order calls for monthly deliveries of $2.5 million commencing in July 2016. Subsequent deliveries after July 2016 may be modified or cancelled subject to 90 days advance notice.

&#160;

For additional information on the transaction with WVH, see &#8220;Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221;.

&#160;

Nxt-ID SmartCard 

&#160;

We are developing a standalone smartcard (the &#8220;NXT Smartcard&#8221;) with the ability to make payments by dynamic magnetic stripe or through interacting with a terminal through EMC, NFC or barcode functionality. We are currently pursuing significant strategic partnerships for this product.

Wi-Mag&#8482; 

&#160; 

Our proprietary antenna and payment technology can be embedded in a mobile device to make wireless payments at most POS terminals which do not require NFC or EMV. This allows us to make payments at most POS terminals in the United States and abroad. According to LTP research (January 12, 2016), there are about 13.9 million POS terminals in the United States of which 57% are currently Magstripe only. The addition of NFC and contactless EMV technology will further increase the locations where our technology works. We are currently in discussions with mobile device makers to license this technology. 

&#160;

&#160; 

MobileBio VoiceMatch&#174; 

&#160; 

Voicematch&#174; is a new method of recognizing both speakers and specific words providing innovative multi-factor recognition. Voice authentication is a more natural biometric method of authentication than fingerprint that allows an individual access to multiple devices. Voicematch is efficient enough to run on low-power devices and runs on mobile platforms such as Android and iOS, as well as laptops and desktops. The product helps to address the growing BYOD (Bring your own device) problem for companies by positively identifying the individual using the mobile device. Voicematch&#174; is a potential original equipment manufacturer (&#8220;OEM&#8221;) product for smartphone manufacturers. The product can also be sold as a standard development kit (&#8220;SDK&#8221;) to provide companies the opportunity to add a further layer of biometric protection to their websites and smartphone applications for their customers.

&#160; 

We expect commercial versions of this product to be available in the third quarter of 2016.

&#160; 

FaceMatch&#174; 

&#160; 

Through the acquisition of 3D-ID, LLC (&#8220;3D-ID&#8221;), the Company acquired 3D FaceMatch&#174; and 3D SketchArtist&#8482; facial recognition products which are available for sale. These products are primarily designed for access control, law enforcement and travel and immigration. Through 3D-ID, we are a sub-contractor to Battelle Memorial Institute on the Department of Defense Technical Information Engineering Services (&#8220;TIES&#8221;) contract with a contract ceiling of $995 million. This is an IDIQ (indefinite delivery indefinite quantity) contract and requires approved contractors to bid on task orders. We have not bid on any task orders to date.

&#160;

Our Industry 

&#160;

The January 2016 issue of the Nilson Report shows that on a worldwide basis, transactions at merchants on the leading payment cards rose to $214 billion in 2014, of which 41.25% were generated in the United States.

&#160;

It is estimated that there are approximately 180 million cardholders in the United States alone with each cardholder owning in excess of three payment cards. Several large technology companies have invested in the belief that in the foreseeable future most people will have embraced and fully adopted the use of smart-devices for purchases they make, nearly eliminating the need for cash or credit cards. They feel that the explosive growth in the use of smartphones and other mobile devices, combined with the convenience, security, and other affordances of mobile payments systems, makes these systems an obvious choice to replace established modes of payment in day-to-day commerce. 

&#160;

Many consumers are resistant to letting technology companies learn even more about their personal purchasing habits and are concerned with the security risk of putting their financial information on a phone. These consumers tend to prefer the use of traditional credit cards in addition to cash.

&#160;

We believe that credit and debit card fraud will continue to be of concern to holders, even if the number of credit card holders/users continues to grow and with it the number of credit card transactions.

&#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Each year approximately 12.7 million people in the United States are victims of identity theft and 44% of known causes of identity theft can be traced to a lost or stolen wallet or purse. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We believe that our products can significantly reduce the incidence of identity theft by concealing the card holder&#8217;s personal information. The Wocket&#174; protects personal information by storing it on an encrypted chip in the Wocket&#174; which can only be accessed by an alpha-numeric PIN and the associated smartcard does not retain any information after the card has been swiped so, unlike the loss or theft of a wallet, the loss or theft of our products do not lead to a breach of personal information. 

&#160;

Rather than try to predict the winning technology in this fast paced evolving payment technology industry, our business plan is to develop secure solutions that can make payments using any form of payment technology from traditional magnetic stripe to NFC, Bluetooth, EMV and barcodes.

&#160;

We believe that our Wi-Mag&#8482; technology, possibly in combination with our voice and facial recognition biometric technologies, will provide an opportunity for smartphone manufacturers who currently do not have a payment solution on their smartphones to license that capability from us. We believe that this is a large potential opportunity for us. According to Gartner (March 2015), worldwide smartphone sales to end users were approximate 1.2 billion units in 2015. 1 billion of these units had Android operating systems. 

&#160;

Our Competition 

&#160;

The markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change as a result of technical developments exploited by our competitors, changing technical needs of customers, and frequent introductions of new features. We expect competition to increase as other companies introduce products that are competitively priced, that may have increased performance or functionality, or that incorporate technological advances not yet developed or implemented by us. Some of our present and potential competitors may have financial, marketing, and research resources substantially greater than ours.

&#160;

Competitors in the digital wallet marketplace include: 

&#160;

Google Wallet &#8211; A mobile payment system developed by Google that allows its users to store debit cards, credit cards, loyalty cards, and gift cards among other things, as well as redeeming sales promotions on their mobile phone.

&#160;

Apple Pay &#8211; A mobile payment service that lets certain Apple mobile devices make payments at the time of retail and online checkout.

&#160;

Paypal &#8211; A mobile service that can send money between other PayPal users and friends, track your balances, check in to pay from ones phone, and order ahead at restaurants.

&#160;

Samsung/LoopPay &#8211; A mobile payment system that uses Magnetic Secure Transmission to broadcast a signal to a point of sale payment terminal. This company was acquired by Samsung Electronics Co. in February 2015.

&#160;

The advantage of our payment products is that our products are capable of using many different methods of payment whereas most of our competitors rely solely on NFC which has limited penetration at POS terminals worldwide.

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Business Strategy &#160; 

&#160; 

We have established a strategic partnership with WVH an international direct selling travel company, to supply them with a white label NXT Smartcard. WVH intends to purchase the product from us for its membership, which is currently in excess of 500,000 members. We intend to pursue similar relationships with partners that have a connected customer base.

&#160;

More and more mobile phones are being used as a source of payment for goods and services. We believe that worldwide mobile payment volume will continue to grow rapidly in the upcoming years. We are actively marketing our Wi-Mag &#8482; technology to manufacturers of smartphones to enable them to compete with payment offerings from the two major brands: Samsung and Apple. We believe that this will result in significant licensing revenue and is a very scalable business model.

&#160;

The Wocket&#174;, while technically very well received, has had a delayed expanded launch in the United States as the introduction of EMV chip technology has limited the number of POS terminals that will accept payment by the Wocket&#174;. We are addressing this by incorporating NFC payment capability in the Wocket&#174; as NFC is accepted at many POS terminals that are configured for EMV chip cards. The hardware element is already incorporated in current Wocket&#174; inventory and we are in the process of working with financial institutions and payment companies to enable the processing of these transactions. We expect to have this capability enabled in the third quarter of 2016. We are also pursuing export opportunities for the Wocket&#174; to overseas markets which have not adopted EMV chip technology and where the Wocket&#174; has a very high rate of acceptance.

&#160;

We have developed several proprietary methods of encryption and tokenization that we believe will help reduce fraud in credit card transactions. These technologies can be applied both at the point of sale and for online transactions. We intend to market our encryption capabilities to potential financial partners which, if successful could generate a significant source of recurring revenue per transaction to us.

&#160;

We continue to develop opportunities for our biometric and sensor capabilities with the Department of Defense. We are partnered with established prime contractors that have or are bidding for contracts through which sales may be made. Our current partners include Battelle Memorial Institute and Verizon Federal Systems. We are a sub-contractor to Battelle Memorial Institute on the Department of Defense Technical Information Engineering Services (&#8220;TIES&#8221;) contract with a contract ceiling of $995 million. This is an IDIQ (indefinite delivery indefinite quantity) contract and requires approved contractors to bid on task orders. We have not bid on any task orders to date.

&#160; 

Our Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our ability to compete effectively depends to a significant extent on our ability to protect our proprietary information. We currently rely and will continue to rely primarily on patents and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights. We have filed the following 19 patents:

Subsequent to the acquisition of 3D-ID, we licensed sixteen (16) other United States&#8217; patents in the field of biometrics. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our consultants and key employees, and maintain control over access to and distribution of our technology, software and other proprietary information. The steps we have taken to protect our technology may be inadequate to prevent others from using what we regard as our technology to compete with us.

&#160; 

We do not generally conduct exhaustive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties. In addition, product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed, with regard to similar technologies. 

&#160; 

We may face claims by third parties that our products or technology infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the future. Any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, even if the claim is invalid, and could distract the attention of our management. If any of our products are found to violate third-party proprietary rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages. In addition, we may be required to re-engineer our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties to continue to offer our products. Any efforts to re-engineer our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms may not be successful, which would prevent us from selling our products, and in any case, could substantially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
