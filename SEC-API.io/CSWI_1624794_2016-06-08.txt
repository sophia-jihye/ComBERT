 ITEM 1: BUSINESS 

Overview 

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 6, 2014 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Capital Southwest Corporation (&#147;Capital Southwest&#148;). We were formed solely for the purpose of effecting the distribution of our outstanding shares of common stock on a pro rata basis to holders of Capital Southwest common stock (the &#147;Share Distribution&#148;) and to become the holding company for a group of manufacturing companies that were owned by Capital Southwest prior to the Share Distribution. The Share Distribution was completed on September 30, 2015, resulted in CSWI becoming a standalone, publicly-traded company with sole ownership of the Operating Subsidiaries. 

Our Company 

We are a diversified industrial growth company with well-established, scalable platforms and domain expertise across three business segments: Industrial Products; Coatings, Sealants &#38; Adhesives; and Specialty Chemicals. Our broad portfolio of leading products provides performance optimizing solutions to our customers. Our products include mechanical products for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (&#147;HVAC&#148;) and refrigeration applications, coatings and sealants and high performance specialty lubricants. Markets that we serve include HVAC, industrial, rail, plumbing, architecturally-specified building products, energy, mining and other general industrial markets. 

Drawing on our innovative and proven technologies, we seek to deliver solutions to our professional customers that require superior performance and reliability. We believe our industrial brands, such as RectorSeal No. 5 &#174; and KOPR-KOTE &#174; , are well known in the specific industries we serve and have a reputation for high quality and reliability. Through organic growth and acquisitions, we believe we are well positioned to offer our customers an increasingly broad portfolio of performance optimizing solutions. We have a successful record of making accretive acquisitions &#150; in the last five fiscal years, we completed 13 acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $187.3 million. We believe there are further attractive acquisition opportunities available within the markets in which we operate. 

We have a long history of providing high quality specialty chemicals, coatings, sealants and other products, accompanied by dependable service and attention to customer satisfaction. Our specialty lubricants were used on the excavation equipment for the Panama Canal in the late 1800s. We also have a long history of innovation. We believe that we were the first to develop a method for removing internal acid from air conditioning and refrigeration systems, pioneering the market for acid neutralizers. We partner with our customers to solve specific challenges, such as environment-friendly lubricants, which were specifically developed to provide high performance in rail applications combined with biodegradability and no eco-toxicity to satisfy strict environmental requirements. 

Prior to the Share Distribution, our Operating Subsidiaries operated as separate businesses, which are discussed below: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; RectorSeal . RectorSeal formulates specialty chemical products including pipe thread sealants, firestop sealants, plastic solvent cements and other formulations for plumbing, HVAC, electrical and industrial

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe we have the following competitive strengths: 

Broad Portfolio of Industry Leading Products and Solutions 

We have a broad portfolio of products with leading industry positions in the specific end markets in which we operate. We believe our products and solutions are differentiated from those of our competitors by superior performance, quality and total value delivered to customers. For example, our RectorSeal No. 5 &#174; product is widely regarded as an industry standard for thread sealants for HVAC, plumbing and electrical configurations. Additionally, we believe our KOPR-KOTE &#174; product is recognized as the anti-seize compound of choice for use in oil and gas drilling operations, where it is asked for by name. 

Sustainable Organic Revenue Growth and Operating Performance 

We focus on end markets with strong growth trends, such as HVAC, rail and construction. We also have a loyal customer base that recognizes the performance and quality of our products and solutions, including continuously evaluating the potential uses of existing products to broaden our market penetration. Further, our customer base is diverse &#150; for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, no single customer represented more than 10% of our net revenues. 

These factors have enabled us to generate strong margin performance. We continue to improve our profitability through targeted investments to further optimize our manufacturing processes. For example, in the Specialty Chemicals segment, we are in the process of consolidating the manufacturing of some of our lubricant and grease products into our Rockwall, Texas facility in order to optimize capacity, improve efficiency and leverage technologies while enhancing product quality and internal environmental, health and safety standards. Further, we continue to refine our manufacturing processes in all of our manufacturing facilities to lower manufacturing costs, increase production capacity and improve product quality. 

Stable Platform for Acquisitions with Proven Track Record 

We believe our experience in identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions is one of our core competitive strengths, as evidenced by the 34 acquisitions we have successfully completed since 1991. Since April 1, 2011, we have invested $187.3 million in acquisitions that either (1) added new products designed to service our existing end markets or (2) provided an entry into new, complementary end markets where we can drive revenue growth and improved profitability. Historically, our acquisitions have been relatively small, lower-risk acquisitions of a product that we have identified as having the potential to benefit from our extensive distribution network and manufacturing efficiencies. We have also consummated larger acquisitions that complement our business model. 

We completed three acquisitions during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Effective April 1, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Strathmore, a leading participant in the coatings market. Strathmore also has a history of successfully integrating acquisitions, having completed five acquisitions since 1993. Effective October 1, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Deacon Industries, Inc., a leading manufacturer of high temperature sealants and injectable packings. Effective December 15, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of AC Leak Freeze, a leading manufacturer of original equipment manufacturer-safe air conditioning and refrigerant leak repair solutions. 

&#160;

Culture of Product Enhancement and Customer Centric Solutions 

We have a long history of serving our customers with high quality products and solutions. We work closely with our customers, industry experts and research partners to continuously improve our existing products to meet evolving customer and market requirements. Our highly trained and specialized personnel work directly with our current and prospective customers to enhance our product offerings by expanding the use and markets for our existing products. We focus on product enhancements and product line extensions that are designed to meet the specific application needs of our customers. We believe this focus has helped us build strong industrial brands and develop a reputation for high quality, in turn leading us to realize improved customer retention and loyalty. Further, our ability to meet the needs of high-value niche end markets with customized solutions that leverage our existing products has enabled us to differentiate ourselves from our larger competitors that may not have the flexibility or interest in responding quickly to evolving customer demands in these smaller, niche markets. 

Diverse Sales and Distribution Channels 

Many of our products are sold through service-intensive distribution networks committed to technical support and customer satisfaction. We primarily market through an international network of independent manufacturer representatives and agents calling on our wholesale distributors, contractors and direct customers. The strong, long-term relationships we have developed with our wholesale distribution partners allow us to introduce new products, including both newly developed and acquired products. In addition, our extensive distribution network allows us to reach and serve niche end markets that provide organic growth opportunities and form a key component of our acquisition strategy. 

With certain of our products, we also market through a direct sales force focused on specific customer needs. For example, we sell products in our Coatings, Sealants &#38; Adhesive segment directly to rail car and locomotive manufacturers. 

Experienced Management Team 

Our management team is highly regarded in each of our business segments. Collectively, our management team, including our executive officers, has an average of 25 years of experience in the industrial manufacturing and specialty chemicals industries. They have a successful track record of recognizing and capitalizing upon attractive opportunities in the key markets we serve, and our executive management team has a strong record of effectively managing capital and delivering operating efficiencies over time. In addition, our management team has demonstrated strong capabilities in sourcing and executing strategic and accretive acquisitions. 

Our Growth Strategy 

We are focused on creating significant stockholder value over the long term by increasing our revenue, profitability and free cash flow by (1) expanding the markets and uses for our existing products and (2) growing the portfolio of products we manufacture, market and sell through targeted acquisitions. We believe the key drivers of our growth include: 

Benefits Resulting from the Share Distribution 

Historically, we operated as separate independent companies with discrete strategies and capital structures. The Share Distribution has allowed us, as an independent, standalone company, to pursue a strategy focused on rationalizing our organizational structure and management around our three business segments. We expect this strategy to enable us to realize cost and operational synergies, implement best practices across our operations, cross-sell product offerings and, as a result, grow our market share and increase our profitability. 

Additionally, we believe our standalone company structure will allow us to more effectively allocate capital across our three business segments, enabling more efficient financing of operations and planned growth. 

&#160;

Leveraging Existing Customer Relationships and Products and Solutions 

We expect to continue to increase revenue by leveraging our reputation for providing high quality products to our long-standing customer base. Our team of sales representatives, engineers and other technical personnel continues to proactively collaborate with our distributors and end users to enhance and adapt existing products and solutions to meet evolving customer needs. In addition, we expect to leverage our existing customer base to cross-sell our products and solutions across our three business segments, thereby growing organically. 

Focused Acquisitions that Leverage our Distribution Channels 

While we are focused on improving our existing products and penetrating new markets with these products, we expect to continue to identify and execute acquisitions that will broaden our portfolio of products and offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. We primarily focus on commercially proven products and solutions that currently have limited distribution, but would benefit from a broader distribution network and be attractive to our customers in target end markets. Once acquired, our intent is to utilize our extensive distribution networks to increase revenue by selling those products to our diversified customer base. 

Operational Excellence 

We focus on operational excellence in all aspects of our business, with the end goals of improved efficiencies and increased profitability. We will continue to expand improvement initiatives and information sharing across our entire platform, promoting best practices. For example, to accelerate the process of leveraging best practices across our business segments, we recently organized an operations summit among the manufacturing and procurement leaders of our three business segments, which is expected to generate approximately $2 million in annual procurement savings across the business once it is fully implemented. Manufacturing footprint optimization, including the integration of Jet-Lube and Whitmore that is expected to be completed during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, is expected to generate approximately $5 million in annual savings in our Specialty Chemicals segment. The majority of these savings will begin to be realized during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 with full run-rate savings expected by the end of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. We expect to benefit from exploiting new synergy opportunities by applying our best practices when integrating acquisitions. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in &#147;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#148; (&#147;Item 8&#148;) of this Annual Report for financial and other information regarding our operations. 

Raw Materials and Suppliers 

Our products are manufactured using various raw materials, including base oils, copper flake, aluminum, polyvinyl chloride and tetra-hydrofuran. These raw materials are available from numerous sources and we do not anticipate significant shortages of such materials in the future. We generally purchase these raw materials and components as needed. We do not depend on a single source of supply for any significant raw materials. 

Intellectual Property 

We own a number of trademarks and patents relating to the names and designs of our products. We consider our trademarks and patents to be valuable assets of our business. In addition, our pool of proprietary information, consisting of know-how and trade secrets related to the design, manufacture and operation of our products, is considered particularly valuable. Accordingly, we take proactive measures to protect such proprietary information. We generally own the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell and are not materially encumbered by licensing or franchise agreements. Our trademarks can typically be renewed indefinitely as long as they remain in use, whereas our existing patents generally expire 10 to 20 years from the dates they were filed, which has occurred at various times in the past. We do not believe that the expiration of any individual patent will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

&#160;

Export Regulations 

We are subject to export control regulations in countries from which we export products and services. These controls may apply by virtue of the country in which the products are located or by virtue of the origin of the content contained in the products. If the controls of a particular country apply, the level of control generally depends on the nature of the goods and services in question. Where controls apply, the export of our products generally requires an export license or authorization (either on a per-product or per transaction basis) or that the transaction qualify for a license exception or the equivalent, and may also be subject to corresponding reporting requirements. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for financial and other information regarding our operations. 

Environmental Regulations 

Our operations are subject to certain foreign, federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental, waste management, labor and health and safety matters. Management believes that our business is operated in material compliance with all such regulations. To date, the cost of such compliance has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position or that of our operating subsidiaries. However, violations may occur in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes. Further, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of environmental legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, could require substantial expenditures by us and could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Employees 

As of March 31, 2016, we employed approximately 725 individuals. Of these employees, 14 are represented by unions. We believe relations with our employees throughout our operations are generally satisfactory, including those employees represented by unions. No unionized facility accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended March 31, 2016.

New Product Development &#150; We develop relationships with end users and channel partners to understand existing and new operating conditions where technical innovation or enhancement is needed. For example, these relationships have generated innovation in the areas of modifying existing lubrication products to operate in arctic conditions or modifying an existing product for use in an application where salt water may be present. The development teams located in Rockwall, Texas and Houston, Texas are also actively defining new end markets for product use and penetration. 

Competition &#150; As our products are specialty, rather than commodity, competitors tend to be varied and include global, regional and local companies that may be large or small. The product sales cycle is long when compared to many consumables, resulting in verifiable and repeatable product performance being the key driver of choice, rather than price. As these products protect and enhance the operation of large capital equipment, qualification is based on the proof of value in application, resulting in a high changeover risk barrier. Typical competitors include Shell, Castrol, Fuchs and Exxon-Mobil.

Customers &#150; Specialty Chemicals products are primarily sold through value-added distribution partners, as well as maintenance and repair operations or catalog channels. Specialty Chemicals provides both market-specific and product line-specific training to both the distribution partners and potential end users. Our specialists often visit end users with our distribution partners to advise on critical application issues, which enhances our ability to both &#147;pull&#148; demand from the end user and &#147;push&#148; demand to the distributor partner.
