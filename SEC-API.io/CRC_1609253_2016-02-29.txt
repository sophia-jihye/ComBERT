General &#32; 

We are an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company operating properties exclusively within the State of California. We were incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Occidental on April 23, 2014 and remained a wholly-owned subsidiary of Occidental until the Spin-off. On November 30, 2014, Occidental distributed shares of our common stock on a pro rata basis to Occidental stockholders and we became an independent, publicly traded company, referred to in this annual report as the Spin-off. Occidental retained approximately 18.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock which it has stated it intends to divest on March 24, 2016. 

Business Operations 

Our business is focused on conventional and unconventional assets, exclusively in California. We are the largest oil and gas producer in California on a gross operated basis and we believe we have established the largest privately-held mineral acreage position in the state, consisting of approximately 2.4 million &#32;net acres spanning the state&#8217;s four major oil and gas basins. We produced on average approximately 160 &#32;thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d) net for the year ended December 31, 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , we had net proved reserves of 644 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), with approximately 75% proved developed. Oil represented 72% of our proved reserves. Our aggregate PV-10 value was $5.1 billion . For an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measure PV-10 and a reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see &#8220;Our Reserves and Production Information" below. 

Much of the global exploration and production industry is challenged at current price levels, putting pressure on the industry's ability to generate positive cash flow and access capital. In response to the sharp price declines that began in the second half of 2014, we significantly reduced our 2016 planned capital program to $50 million from $401 million in 2015 as described in additional detail below in &#8220;Portfolio Management and 2016 Capital Budget.&#8221; The curtailment of the development of our properties will lead to a decline in our production and possibly our reserves. Over the long term, a continued decline in our production and reserves would reduce our liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt obligations by negatively impacting our cash flow from operations and the value of our assets. &#32; In 2015, we emphasized projects and activities that focused on cash flow generation in the near term and met our investment criteria. We will continue to employ cost saving measures to more efficiently deploy our capital and to decrease our unit lease operating and general and administrative expenses. We are also pursuing a number of alternatives to deleverage our balance sheet and better align our capital structure with the current commodity price environment as described in more detail in &#8220;Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Liquidity and Financial Resources.&#8221; 

Our asset base has the capacity in the aggregate to generate positive field-level cash flow in the current price environment for 2016. In addition, we believe our asset base has the potential, including the effects of hedging, to remain cash flow neutral after interest payments in 2016. We focused a substantial majority of our 2015 capital on our mature steamfloods, waterfloods and capital workovers, all of which offer among the highest investment performance metrics in our portfolio. Our current drilling inventory comprises a diversified portfolio of oil and natural gas locations that are economically viable in a variety of operating and commodity price conditions, including many that would be economically viable even at current pricing. We are deferring these projects, however, given the capital constraints we have in 2016. We expect that in an improved commodity price environment, this diversified inventory will allow us to target drilling projects that can be funded through our internally generated cash flow. 

Over the longer term, we develop our capital investment programs by prioritizing life of project returns to grow our net asset value over the long term, while balancing the short- and long-term growth potential of each of our assets. We use the Value Creation Index (VCI) metric for project selection and capital allocation across our portfolio of opportunities. The VCI for each project is calculated by dividing the net present value of the project's expected pre-tax cash flow over its life by the present value of the investments, each using a 10% discount rate. Projects are expected to meet a VCI of 1.3, meaning that 30% of expected value is created above our cost of capital for every dollar invested. Our technical teams are consistently working to enhance value by improving the economics of our inventory through detailed geologic studies as well as application of more effective and efficient drilling and completion techniques. As a result, we expect many projects that do not currently meet our investment hurdle today will do so by the time of development. We regularly monitor internal performance and external factors and adjust our capital investment program with the objective of creating the most value from our portfolio of drilling opportunities. We intend to fund our currently limited capital investment program by reinvesting substantially all of our operating cash flow, while considering any potential deleveraging opportunities. 

Approximately 55% &#32;of our 2015 &#32;production was generated by our world-class Elk Hills and Wilmington fields, which have produced over 1.9 and 2.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) to date, respectively. The remaining 45% was generated through a combination of conventional primary, steamflood and waterflood projects as well as unconventional projects. In the last five years, we grew our total production 4% &#32;on a compounded annual basis, from an average of 138 MBoe/d in 2011 to 160 &#32;MBoe/d for the year ended December 31, 2015 , while the proportionate share of oil production for the same period grew from 58% to 65% . The growth of our oil production during this period was approximately 7% &#32;compounded annually. Although with our limited capital program for 2016 we expect our production levels to decline, the percentage of our oil production should continue to increase over time and favorably impact our overall margins as we continue to direct virtually all of our capital investments toward oil-weighted opportunities to the extent the oil-to-gas price relationship remains favorable. For example, our steamflood projects provide some of the highest returns in our portfolio when the oil-to-gas price ratio exceeds five to one. As of December 31, 2015 , the ratio was approximately 20 to one.

For our 2015 production, our net revenue interest (NRI) was approximately 79%. 

(2) 

Our total identified drilling locations include approximately 2,600 gross (2,250 net) locations associated with proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015 . Our total identified drilling locations also include approximately 2,600 gross (2,300 net) injection well locations. Our total identified drilling locations exclude 6,400 gross (5,300 net) prospective resource drilling locations. Please see "&#8212;Our Reserves and Production Information" for more information regarding the processes and criteria through which we identified our drilling locations. 

(3) 

We currently hold approximately 42,800 gross (34,700 net) acres in the Los Angeles basin. Our Los Angeles basin operations are concentrated with pad drilling. 

In response to the deteriorating price environment that started in the second half of 2014 and continued in 2015, we significantly reduced our investment and drilling pace. During 2015, we operated an average of 3 &#32;drilling rigs across the state with two located in the San Joaquin basin (targeting steamflood activities) and one in the Los Angeles basin (targeting waterflood activities). We drilled 286 gross development wells with 254 wells in the San Joaquin basin and 32 in the Los Angeles basin. We also drilled 3 exploration wells in the San Joaquin basin. 

In 2015, we also reduced our workover rig count from 51 at the beginning of the year to 33 at the end of the year to focus on projects that meet our investment criteria in the current environment. With significant operating control of our properties, we have the ability to adjust our drilling and workover rig count in 2016 based on commodity prices and are monitoring market conditions to increase or decrease our program accordingly. For example, we reduced our drilling rig count to zero at the beginning of 2016 in response to further weakness in oil prices. 

In the third quarter of 2015, we announced a voluntary retirement program and other employee actions to align our workforce with our view of the commodity price environment. At the time of our Spin-off, we had about 2,000 employees. We ended the year with about 1,700 employees, representing a 15% reduction mainly through attrition and the third quarter employee actions. Since year end, we have implemented additional actions to reduce our workforce below 1,500 employees. We do not expect these actions to impact our production outlook; they will, however, reduce our operating costs and general and administrative expenses, as well as our drilling costs, and enhance our margins. Also, given the volatile oil price environment and our leverage, we began a hedging program shortly after the Spin-off to protect our cash flow and capital investment program and improve our ability to comply with our credit facility covenants in case of further price deterioration. 

Our large acreage position contains numerous development and growth opportunities due to its varied geologic characteristics and multiple stacked pay reservoirs which, in many cases, are thousands of feet thick. We have a large portfolio of low-risk and low-decline conventional opportunities in each of our major oil and gas basins with approximately 72% of our proved reserves associated with conventional opportunities. Conventional reservoirs are capable of natural flow using primary, steamflood and waterflood recovery methods. In 2015, we targeted our capital investments primarily toward conventional steamflood and waterflood development projects that we expected would contribute to near-term production and cash flow. We also have a significant portfolio of unconventional growth opportunities in lower permeability reservoirs that typically utilize established well stimulation techniques, which are subject to compliance with regulatory requirements. We have approximately 2,000 net identified drilling locations targeting unconventional reservoirs primarily in the San Joaquin basin. Prior to the severe price declines, we were focused on higher-value unconventional production from seven discrete stacked pay horizons within the Monterey formation, primarily within the upper Monterey. Over the longer term, as project economics improve, we will seek to duplicate our successful upper Monterey results to develop opportunities in the unconventional reservoirs of the lower Monterey, Kreyenhagen and Moreno formations, which have similar geological attributes. 

Over the past decade, we have also built a 3D seismic library that covers almost 4,700 square miles, representing over 90% of the 3D seismic data available in California. We have developed unique, proprietary stratigraphic and structural models of the subsurface geology and hydrocarbon potential in each of the four basins in which we operate. In recent years we have tested and successfully implemented various exploration, drilling, completion and enhanced recovery technologies to increase recoveries, growth and returns from our portfolio. We intend to continue building our exploration inventory based on this data set and our experience and have begun marketing an exploration program to potential partners. 

Our Business Strategy 

Near-Term Strategy 

Much of the global exploration and production industry is challenged at current price levels, putting pressure on the industry's ability to generate positive cash flow and access capital. In the current price and constrained capital environment, we intend to remain financially disciplined and prudent with our investments to maximize liquidity and remain compliant with our credit facilities in order to be positioned for an increase in commodity pricing. In response to the sharp price declines that began in the second half of 2014, we are focused on reducing our costs across our operations and deleveraging our balance sheet. We significantly reduced our 2016 planned capital program to $50 million from $401 million in 2015 when we emphasized projects and activities that focused on cash flow generation in the near term and met our investment criteria. The curtailment of the development of our properties will lead to a decline in our production and possibly our reserves. Over the long term, a continued decline in our production and reserves would reduce our liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt obligations by negatively impacting our cash flow from operations and the value of our assets. We will continue to employ cost saving measures to more efficiently deploy our capital and to decrease our unit lease operating and general and administrative expenses. We are also pursuing a number of alternatives to deleverage our balance sheet and better align our capital structure with the current commodity price environment. 

Our current drilling inventory comprises a diversified portfolio of oil and natural gas locations that are economically viable in a variety of operating and commodity price conditions, including many that would be economically viable even at current pricing. We are deferring these projects, however, given the capital constraints we have in 2016. We expect that in an improved commodity price environment, this diversified inventory will allow us to target drilling projects that can be funded through our internally generated cash flow. 

Long-Term Strategy 

&#160; 

We plan to drive long-term shareholder value by applying modern technology to develop our resource base and increase production. We have significant conventional opportunities to pursue, which we develop through their life-cycles to increase recovery factors by transitioning them from primary production to steamfloods, waterfloods and other enhanced recovery mechanisms. In the current price and constrained capital environment, we intend to remain financially disciplined and prudent with our investments to maximize liquidity. In a sustained higher price environment, we intend to direct any additional available and approved capital first to oil projects that provide long-term stable cash flows with low production declines and high returns, such as steamfloods and waterfloods. The principal elements of our long-term business strategy include the following: 

&#8226; 

Focus on high-margin crude oil projects to generate sufficient cash flows to internally fund our capital budget. We expect the percentage of our oil production to continue to increase over time and favorably impact our overall margins as we anticipate directing virtually all of our capital investments towards oil-weighted opportunities in the near future to the extent the oil-to-gas price relationship remains favorable and capital is available. Approximately 96% of our identified drilling inventory is associated with oil-rich projects. At current prices, availability of capital will likely be constrained. In this environment, we intend to focus on continuing the cost efficiencies we delivered in 2015 and identifying additional value-creating opportunities in order to maintain self-funding as prices improve. To the extent we generate any free cash flow, we intend to fund our capital investment program while considering any deleveraging opportunities. 

&#8226; 

Increase the share of conventional projects in our production mix to achieve lower declines and lower base maintenance capital requirements. &#32; Our portfolio of assets includes a large number of steamflood and waterflood projects that have much lower decline rates than many unconventional projects. When crude oil prices increase, we intend to focus the greater portion of our capital investments on such projects, which we expect will result in lower decline rates in our production. Over time, we expect that this strategy will reduce the capital required to maintain flat crude oil production. We have significant additional lower-risk conventional opportunities with 21,150 gross (14,750 net) identified drilling locations, 41% of which are associated with Improved Oil Recovery (IOR) and Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) projects. The remaining 59% are associated with primary recovery methods, many of which we expect will develop into IOR and EOR projects in the future. 

&#8226; 

Proactive and collaborative approach to safety, environmental protection, and community relations. We are committed to managing our assets in a manner that safeguards people and protects the environment, and we seek to proactively engage with regulatory agencies, communities and other stakeholders to pursue mutually beneficial outcomes. As a California company, helping our state meet its water needs is a key strategic focus. Through our investments in water conservation and in recycling of produced water from oil and gas reservoirs, we are a net water supplier to agriculture. In 2015, our operations supplied more than 2.6 billion gallons of reclaimed water for irrigation, a 30% increase from 2014. This water supply to agriculture set a company record and again exceeded the volume of fresh water we purchased for our operations statewide. We continue to evaluate measures to further decrease our fresh water use and to expand the beneficial use of our produced water over the coming years. &#32; 

&#8226; 

Continue to identify high-growth unconventional drilling opportunities. &#32;&#32;Over the longer term and in a higher oil-price environment, we believe we can generate significant production growth from unconventional reservoirs such as tight sandstones and shales. In such environment, we would expect to generate sufficient cash flow from our conventional projects to fund numerous unconventional opportunities in our portfolio. We hold mineral interests in approximately 1.3 million net acres with unconventional potential and have identified 2,300 gross (2,000 net) drilling locations on this acreage. As a result of our increased focus on these reservoirs over the past few years, a significant portion of our production now comes from unconventional assets. While we have not yet developed sufficient information to reliably predict success rates across our entire portfolio, our continued technical reviews of these unconventional projects are allowing us to better understand performance of these reservoirs in addition to improving our overall cycle time from project identification to development. As a result of our increased understanding of these reservoirs, we believe we will be able to direct future available capital more precisely to higher value projects, allowing us to strategically increase our investment levels in unconventional drilling over time. 

&#8226; 

Apply proven modern technologies to enhance production growth. Over the last several decades, the oil and gas industry has focused significantly less effort on utilizing modern development and exploration processes and technologies in California relative to other prolific U.S. basins. We believe this is largely due to other oil companies&#8217; limited capital investments in California, concentration on shallow zone thermal projects, or investments in other assets within their global portfolios. As an independent company focused exclusively on California, we intend, as capital becomes available, to make significant use of proven modern technologies in drilling and completing wells, as well as production methods, which we expect will substantially increase both our cost efficiency and production over time. We have developed an extensive 3D seismic library covering almost 4,700 square miles in all four of our basins, representing over 90% of the 3D seismic data available for California, and have tested and successfully implemented various exploration, drilling, completion, IOR and EOR technologies in the state. 

&#8226; 

Continued focus on our successful exploration program. &#32;As prices improve and sufficient additional capital becomes available, we intend to significantly increase our investment in exploration, focusing on both unconventional and conventional opportunities, primarily in areas that we believe can be quickly developed, such as those adjacent to our existing properties. In addition, we plan to explore and test new unconventional resource areas, which, if successful, could result in significant longer-term production growth. We are also actively pursuing joint venture partnership opportunities to implement our exploration programs. 

Key Characteristics of our Operations 

The following are among the key characteristics of our operations: 

&#8226; 

Operational control of our diverse asset base provides flexibility over various commodity price ranges and preserves future value and growth potential in a higher price environment. Our near 100% operational control of 137 &#32;fields in California provides us flexibility to adapt our investments to various market environments through our ability to select drilling locations, the timing of our development and the drilling and completion techniques we use. Our large and diverse acreage position, approximately 60% of which we hold in fee, allows us to choose among multiple recovery mechanisms, including primary conventional, steamflood, waterflood and unconventional and to develop various products, including oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Approximately 96% of our identified drilling inventory is associated with oil-rich projects, primarily located in the San Joaquin, Los Angeles and Ventura basins, and the remaining inventory is associated with natural gas properties in the Sacramento, San Joaquin and Ventura basins. The variety of recovery mechanisms and product types available to us, together with our operating control, allows us to allocate capital in a manner designed to optimize cash flow over a wide range of commodity prices. The low base decline of our conventional assets allows us to limit production declines with minimal investment. We believe our low base decline positions us well to achieve growth in a higher price environment while living within our means. 

&#8226; 

Relatively favorable margins driven by California's deficit energy market. &#32;We currently sell all of our crude oil into the California refining markets, which we believe have offered relatively favorable pricing compared to other U.S. regions. California imports over 60% of its oil and approximately 90% of its natural gas. A vast majority of the oil is imported via supertanker, with a minor amount arriving by rail. As a result, California refiners have typically purchased crude oil at international waterborne-based prices. We believe that the limited crude transportation infrastructure from other parts of the country to California will continue contributing to higher realizations than most other United States oil markets for comparable grades. In addition, we own fee mineral interests on approximately 60% of our net acreage position. The returns on fee mineral acreage are enhanced because we do not pay royalties and other lease payments. To further improve our margins, we are opportunistically pursuing newly opened export markets for our crude oil production. 

&#8226; 

Largest acreage position in a world-class oil and natural gas province. &#32;&#32;We believe we are the largest private oil and natural gas mineral acreage holder in California, with interests in approximately 2.4 million net acres. California is one of the most prolific oil and natural gas producing regions in the world and is the third largest oil producing state in the nation. It has five of the 12 largest fields in the lower 48 states based on proved reserves as of 2009, and our portfolio includes interests in four of these fields. California is also the nation&#8217;s largest state economy, and the world's eighth largest, with significant energy demands that exceed local supply. Our large acreage position with a diverse development portfolio enables us to pursue the appropriate production strategy for the relevant commodity price environment without the need to acquire new acreage. For example, in a high natural gas price environment we can rapidly increase our investments in the Sacramento basin to generate significant production growth. Our large acreage position also allows us to quickly deploy the knowledge we gain in our existing operations, together with our seismic data, in other areas within our portfolio. 

&#8226; 

Opportunity rich drilling portfolio. &#32;&#32;Our drilling inventory at December 31, 2015 consisted of approximately 23,450 gross identified well locations, including 21,150 gross (14,750 net) conventional drilling locations and approximately 2,300 gross (2,000 net) unconventional drilling locations. Our drilling inventory count increased by about 16% from the prior year as a result of our technical teams' continued efforts. We have a large inventory of conventional development opportunities that we expect can provide stable lower-risk production with attractive returns based on capital availability. In a more favorable, sustained price environment, we believe we can also achieve long-term production growth through the development of unconventional reservoirs. In addition, our rich conventional and unconventional portfolio can provide attractive joint venture partnership opportunities, including in the current environment. 

&#8226; 

Proven operational management and technical teams with extensive experience operating in California. The members of our operational management and technical teams have an average of over 25 years&#8217; experience in the oil and natural gas industry, with an average of over 15 years focused on our California oil and gas operations through multiple pricing cycles. Our operational management team and technical staff have a proven track record of applying modern technologies and operating methods to develop our assets and improve their operating efficiencies. For example, our teams have successfully reduced total field operating costs by approximately 13% on a per Boe basis in 2015 while increasing production in a challenging environment. Our teams are continuing to improve efficiencies across all our operations in 2016. 

Portfolio Management and 2016 Capital Budget 

We develop our capital investment programs by prioritizing life of project returns to grow our net asset value over the long term, while balancing the short- and long-term growth potential of each of our assets. We use the VCI metric for project selection and capital allocation across our portfolio of opportunities. 

We focused a substantial majority of our 2015 capital on our mature steamfloods, waterfloods and capital workovers, all of which offer among the highest VCIs in our portfolio. We focus on creating value and are committed to internally fund our capital budget with operating cash flows. Our low decline assets plus our high level of operational control and absence of long term commitments give us the flexibility to adjust the level of such capital investments as circumstances warrant. Of the total $401 million 2015 capital program, approximately $130 million was allocated to drilling wells, $120 million to facilities and compression expansion, $55 million to workovers, $40 million to maintenance and occupational health, safety and environmental projects, $15 million to exploration, $10 million to 3D seismic and the rest to other items. 

For 2016, our board of directors approved a capital program of $50 million to maintain the mechanical integrity of our facilities and systems and operate them safely. In light of current commodity prices, we have built a dynamic budget for 2016 that adjusts our activity to align investments with operating cash flows. We will monitor prices and cash flow throughout the year and, if oil prices improve, may deploy additional available and approved capital focusing initially on a combination of capital workovers and new wells that meet our investment metrics. Our 2016 capital investment budget targets maintenance capital in the San Joaquin, Los Angeles and Ventura basins, and is expected to enhance the mechanical integrity and safety of our systems and infrastructure. Any capital increases will be directed almost entirely towards oil-weighted production consistent with our activity in 2015. 

In addition, during this period of lower activity levels, we will continue to refine modern techniques that will enhance the value and growth potential of other parts of our portfolio that will not be funded in 2016 and will continue to build our inventory of available projects. This will position us to take advantage of improved market conditions when prices reach more favorable levels.

Marketing Arrangements 

We market our crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and electricity in accordance with standard energy industry practices. 

Crude Oil. Substantially all of our crude oil production is connected to California markets via our crude oil gathering pipelines, which are used almost entirely for our production. We generally do not transport, refine or process the crude oil we produce and do not have any significant long-term crude oil transportation arrangements in place. California is heavily reliant on imported sources of energy, with over 60% of oil consumed during 2015 imported from outside the state, mostly from foreign locations. We currently sell all of our crude oil into the California refining markets, which we believe have offered relatively favorable pricing compared to other U.S. regions for similar grades. Since California imports a significant percentage of its crude oil requirements, California refiners typically purchase crude oil at international waterborne-based prices. Currently, none of our index-based crude oil sales contracts have terms extending past 90 days. Beginning in late 2015, the U.S. federal government allowed the export of crude oil. As a result, we are opportunistically pursuing newly opened export markets for our crude oil production to improve our margins. 

Given the volatile oil price environment, as well as our leverage, we began a hedging program shortly after the Spin-off to protect our cash flows, margins and capital investment program and improve our ability to comply with our credit facility covenants in case of further price deterioration. We will continue to be strategic and opportunistic in implementing our hedging program. 

Unless otherwise indicated, we use the term "hedge" to describe derivative instruments that are designed to achieve our hedging program goals, even though they are not necessarily accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges. Our existing Brent-based weighted-average oil hedge positions, substantially all of which were costless collars, including those entered into in early 2016, are as follows:

(a) Q1 2016 averages include puts for 10,000 barrels of oil per day of our March 2016 production at $46 per barrel. 

Natural Gas. California imports approximately 90% of the natural gas consumed in the state. We have firm transportation capacity contracts to access markets where necessary. These contracts are required to facilitate deliveries. We sell virtually all of our natural gas production under individually negotiated contracts using market-based pricing on a monthly or shorter basis. 

NGLs. We process substantially all of our NGLs through our processing plants, which facilitates access to third party delivery points near the Elk Hills field. We currently have pipeline capacity contracts to transport 20,000 barrels per day of NGLs to market. We sell virtually all of our NGLs using index-based pricing. Our NGLs are generally sold pursuant to one-year contracts that are renewed annually. 

Electricity. We provide part of the electrical output of our Elk Hills power plant to reduce Elk Hills field operating costs and increase reliability and sell the excess to the grid and to others under contract. 

Our Principal Customers 

We sell our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production to marketers, California refineries and other purchasers that have access to transportation and storage facilities. Our marketing of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs can be affected by factors that are beyond our control, and which cannot be accurately predicted. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, Phillips 66 Company, Tesoro Refining &#38; Marketing Company LLC and Valero Marketing &#38; Supply Company each accounted for more than 10%, and, collectively, 61% &#32;of our revenue. For the years ended 2014 and 2013, ConocoPhillips/Phillips 66 Company and Tesoro Refining &#38; Marketing Company LLC each accounted for more than 10%, and, collectively, 45% &#32;and 42% &#32;of our revenue, respectively. 

Title to Properties 

As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we initially conduct a high level review of the title to our properties at the time of acquisition. Individual properties may be subject to ordinary course burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect the value of our properties. Such burdens on properties may include customary royalty interests, liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes, obligations or duties under applicable laws, development obligations, or net profits interests, among others. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a more thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured known title defects that are material to the project. In addition, our properties have been pledged as collateral to secure our credit facilities. 

Competition 

We have many competitors, some of which are larger and better funded, may be willing to accept greater risks or have special competencies. See "Risk Factors." 

Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry 

Our operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, local and other laws and regulations relating to the exploration and development of our properties, the production, transportation, and sale of our products, and the services we provide. 

Regulation of Exploration and Production 

California has regulations governing: 

&#8226; 

oil and natural gas production including well spacing or density, on private and state lands; 

&#8226; 

methods of constructing, drilling and completing wells, including well stimulation techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and acid matrix stimulation; 

&#8226; 

design, construction, operation and maintenance of facilities, such as natural gas processing plants, power plants, compressors and pipelines; 

&#8226; 

improved or enhanced recovery techniques such as fluid injection for waterflooding or steamflooding; 

&#8226; 

sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling, completion, stimulation and enhanced recovery processes; 

&#8226; 

imposition of taxes and fees with respect to our properties and operations; 

&#8226; 

the conservation of oil and natural gas, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties; 

&#8226; 

posting of bonds or other financial assurance to drill or operate wells and facilities; and 

&#8226; 

occupational health, safety and environmental matters and the transportation and sale of our products as described below. 

The Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) of the Department of Conservation is the state&#8217;s primary regulator of the oil and natural gas industry on private and state lands, with additional oversight from the State Lands Commission&#8217;s administration of state surface and mineral interests. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) of the U.S. Department of the Interior exercises similar jurisdiction on federal lands in California. In addition, specific aspects of our operations, such as occupational health, safety, air or water quality, labor, marketing and taxation, are regulated by other federal, state or local agencies. Collectively, the effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. 

For example, in 2013, California adopted Senate Bill 4 (SB 4), which mandates further regulation of certain well stimulation techniques, including hydraulic fracturing and acid matrix stimulation. Among other things, SB 4 requires: 

&#8226; 

additional permitting of defined well stimulation treatments; 

&#8226; 

prior notification to proximate property owners or lessees of proposed stimulation treatments, and pre- and post-stimulation groundwater sampling as requested by the owner or lessee; 

&#8226; 

monitoring of groundwater quality in areas where well stimulation treatments occur, or concurrence that monitoring is not warranted due to a lack of protected water as defined by SB 4; and 

&#8226; 

public disclosure of fluids used and other stimulation data, including data that may be considered proprietary or trade secret. 

SB 4 also required state agencies to prepare an environmental impact report and scientific studies regarding well stimulation, which were published in 2015. Various state agencies are reviewing these studies to determine whether any additional regulation is warranted. In 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the BLM adopted or proposed additional federal regulations on certain well stimulation operations. The implementation of well stimulation regulations and associated studies and reports have delayed and increased the cost of certain operations, and additional regulations may further increase costs and cause additional delays. 

In addition, the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and analogous state laws regulate the injection of produced water, steam, natural gas or carbon dioxide into underground reservoirs for enhanced oil recovery or disposal. The state has issued permits for injection wells for decades under these laws. In 2015, the state imposed deadlines for obtaining confirmation from the EPA of aquifer exemptions under the SDWA to continue injecting and disposing produced water in certain fields. If the state or EPA were to rescind existing aquifer exemptions or permits for injection wells, reject new exemptions or permits or otherwise change the existing underground injection program, then our ability to inject produced water could be curtailed and our development and production activities could be negatively affected. 

Finally, certain local governments have proposed or adopted ordinances that purport within their jurisdictions to regulate drilling activities in general, or stimulation and completion activities in particular, or to ban such activities outright. None of the adopted local ordinances is expected to materially impact our current or expected future operations. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local restrictions are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs, experience delays or curtailment of our exploration or production activities and potentially be precluded from drilling wells or injecting fluids. Our competitors in the California oil and natural gas industry are generally subject to the same laws and regulations that affect our operations. 

Regulation of Health, Safety and Environmental Matters 

Numerous federal, state, local, and other laws and regulations that govern health and safety, the release or discharge of materials, land use or environmental protection may restrict the use of our properties and operations, increase our costs or lower demand for or restrict the use of our products and services. Applicable federal health, safety and environmental laws include, but are not limited to, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Oil Pollution Act, Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act, Pipeline Safety Improvement Act, Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act, Endangered Species Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and National Environmental Policy Act. California imposes additional laws that are analogous to, and often more stringent than, such federal laws. These laws and regulations: 

&#8226; 

require various permits and approvals before drilling, workovers, production, underground fluid injection, or waste disposal commences, or before facilities are constructed or put into operation; 

&#8226; 

require the installation of sophisticated safety and pollution control equipment to prevent or reduce releases or discharges of regulated materials to air, land, surface water or ground water; 

&#8226; 

restrict the use, types or sources of water, energy, land surface, habitat or other natural resources, require conservation and reclamation measures, and impose energy efficiency or renewable energy standards; 

&#8226; 

restrict the types, quantities, and concentrations of regulated materials, including oil, natural gas, produced water or wastes, that can be released or discharged into the environment, or any other uses of those materials resulting from drilling, production, processing, power generation or transportation activities; 

&#8226; 

limit or prohibit operations on lands lying within coastal, wilderness, wetlands, groundwater recharge, endangered species habitat, and other protected areas; 

&#8226; 

establish standards for the closure, abandonment, cleanup or restoration of former operations, such as plugging of abandoned wells and decommissioning of facilities; 

&#8226; 

impose substantial liabilities for unauthorized releases or discharges of regulated materials into the environment with respect to our current or former properties and operations and other locations where such materials or wastes generated by us or our predecessors were released or discharged; 

&#8226; 

require comprehensive environmental analyses, recordkeeping and reports with respect to operations affecting federal, state and private lands or leases; 

&#8226; 

impose taxes or fees with respect to the foregoing matters; 

&#8226; 

may expose us to litigation by governmental authorities, special interest groups and other claimants; and 

&#8226; 

may restrict our rate of oil, NGLs, natural gas and electricity production. 

Federal, state and local agencies may assert overlapping authority to regulate in these areas. In addition, certain of these laws and regulations may apply retroactively and may impose strict or joint and several liability on us for events or conditions over which we and our predecessors had no control, without regard to fault, legality of the original activities, or ownership or control by third parties. 

Federal, state and local governments frequently revise health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, and any changes that result in delays or more stringent permitting, materials handling, engineering, disposal, cleanup and restoration requirements for the oil and gas industry could have a significant impact on our capital investments and operating costs. Failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal fines and penalties and liability for non-compliance, costs of corrective action, installation of pollution control equipment, cleanup and restoration, compensation for personal injury, property damage or other losses, and the imposition of injunctive or declaratory relief that may delay, modify or prevent development, construction or operations. Releases, discharges or other accidents may occur in the course of our operations and may result in significant costs and liabilities, including governmental or third-party claims for personal injury or damage to property or natural resources. 

Regulation of Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions 

A number of international, federal, state, and regional efforts seek to prevent or mitigate the effects of climate change or to track or reduce GHG emissions associated with industrial activity, including operations of the oil and natural gas production sector and those who use our products as a source of energy. The EPA has adopted regulations to restrict GHG emissions from certain mobile sources, require certain operations, including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities, to monitor and report GHG emissions on an annual basis, and incorporate measures to reduce GHG emissions in permits for certain facilities. 

In 2006, California adopted Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), which established a statewide &#8220;cap-and-trade&#8221; program for GHG emissions. Under the program, which commenced in 2012, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) set a statewide maximum limit on total GHG emissions, and this cap declines annually through 2020. CARB requires us, and other businesses in the oil and natural gas production sector, to report GHG emissions. We are required to obtain allowances or qualifying offset credits for each metric ton of GHGs emitted from our operations and from the sale of certain products to customers for use in California. The state grants a portion of the allowance, but we must make up any shortfall by purchasing additional allowances from either the state or a third party. The availability of allowances will decline over time, and the cost to acquire such allowances may increase. The cap-and-trade program currently expires in 2020. California Senate bills in 2014 and 2015 proposed to extend the program to 2050. Although those bills were not adopted, similar legislation may be proposed in the future. 

In 2015, the California cap-and-trade program began to cover emissions from the sale of propane and liquid transportation fuels for use in the state. Producers or marketers of propane and refiners of liquid transportation fuels will be responsible for retiring allowances equivalent to the metric tons of carbon dioxide estimated to be produced from the combustion of the propane and transportation fuels they market for use in California. Under AB 32, CARB has also imposed a &#8220;low carbon fuel&#8221; standard, which requires refiners to reduce the carbon content of transportation fuels they market in California by 10% by 2020. In 2015, California enacted SB 350, which established goals to derive 50% of California&#8217;s electricity from renewable sources and to double the energy efficiency of buildings in the state by 2030. The Governor&#8217;s stated goal to reduce petroleum use in cars and trucks by 50% from current levels was not enacted by the Legislature, but may be the subject of additional regulations by CARB. At the United Nations Climate Conference in Paris in December 2015, California&#8217;s Governor announced that the state is seeking to create a western regional electricity market and to incorporate certain U.S. states, Canadian provinces and cities in other countries into California&#8217;s cap-and-trade program. These programs and policies, as well as federal and California subsidies and tax incentives for the development and construction of alternative energy-fueled power generation and transportation, may reduce demand for our products and services or require further controls on, or modifications to, our operations. 

If we are unable to recover or pass through a significant portion of our costs related to complying with climate change regulations, these regulations could materially affect our operations and financial condition. To the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of, and access to, capital. Future legislation or regulations adopted to address climate change could also make our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. 

Regulation of Transportation and Sale of Our Products 

Our sales prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas in the United States are set by the market and are not presently regulated. In late 2015, the U.S. federal government lifted restrictions on the export of domestically produced oil, which will allow the sale of our oil production in additional markets, and may affect the prices we realize. 

Interstate transportation rates for oil, natural gas and NGLs are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The FERC has established an indexing system for such transportation, which allows pipelines to take an annual inflation-based rate increase. We are not able to determine the effect, if any, these regulations have on us, but, other factors being equal, the regulations may, over time, tend to increase transportation costs, which may affect our margins. 

Market Manipulation and Market Transparency Regulations 

Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC possesses regulatory oversight over natural gas and power markets to prevent market manipulation. The Federal Trade Commission has similar regulatory oversight of oil markets to prevent market manipulation. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also holds authority over the physical and futures energy commodities market pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act. We are required to observe these laws and related regulations when we engage in physical purchases and sales of oil, NGLs and natural gas and when we engage in hedging activity. These agencies hold substantial enforcement authority, including the ability to assess civil penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation, to order disgorgement of profits and to recommend criminal penalties. We could also be subject to related third-party damage claims for violation of these laws brought by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities. In addition, the FERC has issued market transparency rules for natural gas and power that affect some of our operations and impose reporting and other obligations on us. 

Natural Gas Gathering Regulations 

Section 1(b) of the federal Natural Gas Act exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the FERC. We own certain natural gas pipelines that we believe meet the traditional tests that FERC has used to establish a pipeline&#8217;s status as a gathering line not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission facilities and federally unregulated gathering facilities is, however, the subject of ongoing litigation, and is otherwise subject to potential change. 

In addition to the federal and state laws described above under the heading "Business - Regulation of Health, Safety and Environmental Matters," our natural gas gathering operations are subject to state statutes designed to prohibit discrimination favoring producers or sources of supply. The regulations may restrict those with whom we contract to gather natural gas. In addition, our natural gas gathering operations could become subject to more stringent application of state or federal regulation of rates and services, though we do not believe any such action would affect us materially differently than our competitors. 

Regulation of Power Sales and Transmission 

The FERC regulates the sale of electricity at wholesale and the transmission of electricity under the Federal Power Act. The FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction includes, among other things, authority over the rates, charges and other terms for the sale of electricity at wholesale by public utilities and for transmission services. In most cases, the FERC does not set rates for the sale of electricity at wholesale by generating companies (such as our subsidiary) that qualify for market-based rate authority, which allows companies to negotiate market rates. In order to be eligible for market-based rate authority, and to maintain exemptions from certain FERC regulations, our subsidiary has been granted market-based rate authorization from the FERC. 

Employees 

Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees. We also utilize the services of independent contractors to perform drilling, well work, operations, construction and other services, including construction contractors whose workforce is often represented by labor unions. Approximately 85 &#32;of our employees are represented by labor unions. We have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages by our employees in the past 36 years or longer. 

In the third quarter of 2015, we announced a voluntary retirement program and other employee actions to align our workforce with our view of the price environment. At the time of the Spin-off, we had about 2,000 employees. As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 1,700 &#32;employees, representing a 15% reduction mainly through attrition and the third quarter employee actions. Since year end, we have implemented additional actions to reduce our workforce below 1,500 employees. 

Effective January 1, 2015, we adopted the California Resources Corporation 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP provides our employees the ability to purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to 85% of the closing price of a share of our common stock as of the first or last day of each fiscal quarter, whichever amount is less. At January 1, 2016, over 50% of our employees had elected to participate in the plan.
