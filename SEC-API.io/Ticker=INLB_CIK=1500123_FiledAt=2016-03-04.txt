 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160;

Corporate Background 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in Delaware on June 15, 2010 under the name Crown Dynamics Corp. The Company&#8217;s original business plan was to develop dental technology.

&#160;

On January 3, 2012, the Company implemented a 3 for 1 forward stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock to the holders of record. As a result of the split, each holder of record on the record date automatically received two additional shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. The accompanying financial statements and related notes thereto have been adjusted accordingly to reflect this forward stock split.

&#160;

On January 20, 2012, the Company entered into an Exclusive Technology License Agreement (the &#8220;Zorah Exclusive License Agreement&#8221;) with Zorah Technology LLC (&#8220;Zorah&#8221;) and shifted our business focus away from dental technology to greater applications in home medical technology. The Zorah Exclusive License Agreement required a one-time issuance of One Million One Hundred and Twenty-Five Thousand (1,125,000) shares of restricted common stock to Zorah. As a result of the Zorah Exclusive License Agreement, the Company obtained exclusive rights to develop and distribute Zorah&#8217;s various technologies, which include a wireless technology to remotely monitor senior citizens and special needs adults and a transdermal blood sugar monitoring unit, which would allow people to take their blood sugar levels without pricking themselves (the &#8220;Zorah Technology&#8221;).

&#160;

On March 20, 2012, through an equity exchange agreement (the &#8220;Share Exchange&#8221;), the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of Airware Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation (&#8220;Airware&#8221;), in exchange for 21,629,695 shares of the Company&#8217;s newly-issued common stock. Airware Holdings, Inc. was formed in February 17, 2010 as a Nevada corporation and is a non-prescription medical products company. Since the Share Exchange, the principal business purpose of the Company has shifted to the development, manufacture and distribution of nasal breathing devices. The Company now targets prospective customers such as compassionate sleeping partners, individuals with allergies and athletic enthusiasts throughout the United States, Canada and Europe.

&#160;

On August 23, 2012, the Company entered into a Non-Exclusive License Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with Zorah Technology, LLC (&#8220;Zorah&#8221;). The Agreement required a one-time issuance of Two Hundred Thousand (200,000) shares of restricted common stock in exchange for non-exclusive rights to develop and distribute the Zorah Technology. This Non-Exclusive License Agreement is meant to modify the existing license agreement originally entered into by the Company and Zorah on January 20, 2012. As a result of this modification, the 1,125,000 common shares issued pursuant to the January 20, 2012 Agreement were cancelled and returned to treasury.

&#160;

Effective on November 13, 2012, the Company&#8217;s name was changed from Crown Dynamics Corp. to Airware Labs Corp.

&#160;

Our principal offices are located at 7377 E Doubletree Ranch Rd., Suite 260, Scottsdale, AZ 85258. Our registered agent for service of process in Delaware is located at 113 Barksdale Professional Center, Newark, DE 19711, and our registered agent is Delaware Intercorp. Our fiscal year end is September 30.

Business Summary 

&#160; 

To date, we primarily engage in the development, manufacture and distribution of nasal breathing devices. The Company has a portfolio of patents all related to the nasal dilator-breathing device, both filtered and non-filtered, and its use as a primary delivery mechanism through the nasal passage of therapeutic essential oils. The Company targets prospective customers such as compassionate sleeping partners, individuals with chronic sinus issues, individuals that suffer from chronic sleep disorders and individuals with allergies throughout the United States, Canada, Asia and Europe. The Company utilizes information and current studies in the development and manufacture of our products in order to help promote the health benefits of improved breathing, particularly information regarding breathing and its impact on the human body, the effects of environmental factors, and the potential benefits provided by the strategic use of therapeutic essential oils. The Company is supported by a selective group of highly experienced doctors, engineers and scientists who provide advice and information on research topics relevant to the Company&#8217;s business purpose. &#160; 

Business Plan 

Airware Labs is a leader in innovative breathing technology solutions and consumer product offerings that enhance breathing. Airware products provide consumers with safe and effective methods to control their own personal breathing environment. Our filtered product also contains 3M filtration media for allergy sufferers. &#160; 

Airware Labs maintains an efficient and economic corporate structure, outsourcing manufacturing and distribution through key strategic partnerships. Airware manufactures all products in China through an exclusive partnership with a factory that manufactures Airware products. Airware&#8217;s corporate headquarters are located in Scottsdale, Arizona and houses the management, sales and marketing teams. 

In April of 2012, Airware entered into a strategic partnership with Quest Products, Inc. (&#8220;Quest&#8221;), whereby Quest will promote and distribute the AIR&#174; product line. Quest Products, Inc. (www.questproductsinc.com) provides turnkey solutions to Consumer Products Group (&#8220;CPG&#8221;) companies looking to develop their product's distribution and sales to all classes of trade. Quest works with varying sizes of CPG companies, from inventors and entrepreneurs beginning start-up brands, to large industry leading CPG manufacturers looking to expand their reach. Quest's unique core competencies allow them to create turnkey solutions and drive new and incremental opportunities in sales for their client partners. Quest's sales team works with food, drug, and mass retailers across the USA and Canada, including Wal-Mart, Target, CVS, and Walgreens. Quest was listed as one of the fastest growing companies four years in a row by INC. Magazine. 

Quest was successful in placing the AIR&#174; product line with many of the largest online retailers, including Walgreens.com, Amazon.com, Drugstore.com, Target.com and more. Quest has also been successful in placing AIR&#174; products in approximately 7,300 Walgreens stores located in the United States and the Company continues to receive reorders from Walgreens. Quest is presently attempting to gain distribution in other retail chains.

In March of 2014, Airware entered into a Joint Venture (&#8220;JV&#8221;) with Eastar Industries in China to act as the exclusive distributor for all Airware products with an initial focus on the AIR&#174; filters product line. Eastar Industries, a subsidiary of Eastar Chemical Corporation, focuses on Eastar's pharmaceutical and health/beauty business for China and selected Southeast Asian countries. Eastar Industries licenses patented pharmaceuticals, medical devices and unique health/beauty products from U.S. and European companies for import to China and Southeast Asia through its local joint venture partner companies. Airware will own 18% of the JV that is formed in Hong Kong. Initial launch of AIR&#174; PM2.5 began in December of 2014 in response to the severe pollution issues burdening most of the tier 1 cities of China. While Eastar remains a distribution partner, the creation of the JV entity has been put on hold as Airware evaluates new distribution options in the Asian market. Given the poor air quality and high demand for discreet and effective personal filtration devices, Airware is exploring more aggressive strategies to market in this region.

In August 2015, Airware hired Dr. Dan Cohen to assume the role of President. Dr. Cohen is the former Founder, Chairman and CEO of CNS, Inc., parent company of Breathe Right. Dr. Cohen was the driving force behind the meteoric rise of Breathe Right nasal strips, acquiring the rights to manufacture and sell the product for the medical equipment company he founded in 1982. With the successful drive to achieve FDA approval for marketing of the largely unknown product and with all of the top ten pharmaceutical wholesalers on board, Cohen launched a legendary marketing effort to generate market awareness. His efforts created an outcry of domestic and international consumer demand that rocketed CNS sales to a 77% increase as the company took the public spotlight and was named Fortune magazine's fourth fastest growing company in the U.S. in 1996. In 2006, GlaxoSmithKline acquired Breathe Right for $566 million. 

Dr. Cohen is a board certified neurologist and an accomplished entrepreneur. In addition to CNS, Inc., he is also the co-founder of Round River Research Corporation and the inventor of patented technology used for stress reduction and personal development. Dr. Cohen holds numerous patents related to EEG signal processing, physiologic analysis algorithms and additional utility patents related to synchronized sound, vibration and electromagnetic fields and their effect on the body and mind.

&#160;

Dr. Cohen believes the Airware Nasal filter to be the best product in the market and has engineered a strategic plan to enhance Airware&#8217;s nasal filtration product line with a launch planned in 2016, which includes extensive PR, education and awareness of the product benefits and competitive advantages.

Business Opportunity &#38; Product Solutions 

In the US alone, there exists a multi-billion dollar market for health related breathing products. Many of these products are sold over-the-counter (OTC) and have been developed specifically to enhance nasal breathing, relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis, reduce snoring and improve sleep. Air&#174; products specifically target these segments of the OTC breathing products market. 

The AIR &#174; nasal dilator is made from FDA-approved, latex-free/adhesive-free hypoallergenic medical grade material and has passed both cytotoxicity and an intra-cutaneous reactivity testing. The product is discreet, positioned inside the nostrils, and gently expands the nasal valve regions of the nasal passages thus opening the nasal airway allowing for easier nasal breathing. Many snorers do so because they cannot effectively breathe through their nose. By opening up the nasal passages allowing for greater nasal airflow, users are able to close their mouths and thereby reduce or stop snoring. Improved nasal breathing as well as reduced snoring generally improves sleep too. Unlike nasal strips, whose sales exceed $150M, the AIR &#174; product can be worn all day and night in comfort, without significantly altering appearance.

AIR&#174; nasal products are manufactured with or without 3M's Filtration Media depending on the whether the product is designed to enhance nasal breathing alone or in addition, filter the air of particulate matter including allergens and bacteria. AIR&#174; Allergy with 3M Filtration Media captures a larger number, and smaller size of particles, preventing them from entering the body. This in turn helps with the prevention of allergy symptoms and infection gained through airborne illnesses. The product is worn discreetly inside the nose, allowing daytime or nighttime use.

The 3M&#8482; Air Filter Media used in Air products is uniquely constructed of permanently charged engineered fibers. These high permanent electrostatic charges allow the fibers to better capture and hold sub-micron particles, allowing particles to be effectively captured throughout the depth of the media, rather than only on the upstream surface, creating a filter that captures both a smaller sized particle, as well as an increase in the number of particles collected. The use of this filter technology in the AIR&#174; Allergy product is the first use of the technology in this format.

Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and generic drug companies that offer products similar to ours. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do, as well as greater experience in the discovery and development of products and the commercialization of those products. Our competitors&#8217; products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any products we may commercialize and may render our products obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of their development and commercialization. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market and advanced technologies become available. However, we believe that our products offer key potential advantages over competitive products that could enable our products to capture meaningful market share from our competitors . &#160;
