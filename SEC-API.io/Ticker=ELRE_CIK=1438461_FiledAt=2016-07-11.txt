The Company was established as an exploration stage company engaged in the search for commercially viable minerals. We no longer pursue opportunities related to the exploration of minerals. Our name change to Yinfu Gold Corporation, as filed with the State of Wyoming on November 18, 2010, signified that we have commenced working toward a major change in our business plan and business model.

Currently, we do not yet have a source of revenue. We are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations. Historically, we were able to raise a limited amount of capital through a private placement of our equity stock and through loans from our president, but we are uncertain about our continued ability to obtain adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and our business may fail.
