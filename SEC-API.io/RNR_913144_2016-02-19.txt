OVERVIEW 

RenaissanceRe was established in 1993 and is a leading global provider of reinsurance and insurance coverages and related services. Our aspiration is to be the world’s best underwriter by matching well-structured risks with efficient sources of capital. &#32;&#32; Through our operating subsidiaries, we seek to produce superior returns for our shareholders by being a trusted, long-term partner to our customers for assessing and managing risk, and by delivering responsive solutions. We accomplish this by leveraging our core capabilities of risk assessment and information management, by investing in our capabilities to serve our customers across the cycles that have historically characterized our markets and by keeping our promises. Overall, our strategy focuses on superior risk selection, superior customer relationships and superior capital management. We provide value to our customers and joint venture partners in the form of financial security, innovative products, and responsive service. We are known as a leader in paying valid reinsurance claims promptly. We principally measure our financial success through long-term growth in tangible book value per common share plus the change in accumulated dividends, which we believe is the most appropriate measure of our Company’s financial performance, and believe we have delivered superior performance in respect of this measure over time. 

Our core products include property catastrophe and specialty reinsurance risks written through our wholly owned operating subsidiaries, joint ventures and Syndicate 1458; and certain insurance products primarily written through Syndicate 1458. We believe we are one of the world’s leading providers of property catastrophe reinsurance. We also believe we have a strong position in certain specialty reinsurance lines of business and a growing presence in the Lloyd’s marketplace. Our reinsurance and insurance products are principally distributed through intermediaries, with whom we seek to cultivate strong long-term relationships. We continually explore appropriate and efficient ways to address the risk needs of our clients. We have created and managed, and continue to manage, multiple capital vehicles and may create additional risk bearing vehicles in the future. As our product and geographical diversity increases, we may be exposed to new risks, uncertainties and sources of volatility. 

Since a meaningful portion of the reinsurance and insurance we write provides protection from damages relating to natural and man-made catastrophes, our results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of such catastrophic events, and the coverages we offer to customers affected by these events. We are exposed to significant losses from these catastrophic events and other exposures we cover. Accordingly, we expect a significant degree of volatility in our financial results and our financial results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year, based on the level of insured catastrophic losses occurring around the world. Our acquisition of Platinum Underwriters Holdings, Ltd. ("Platinum") on March 2, 2015 accelerated the growth of our U.S. platform by expanding our client base and enhancing our U.S. market presence in our casualty and specialty reinsurance lines of business. Accordingly, in the future, 

these lines of business may represent a greater proportion of our premiums and claims and claim expenses, and generate a higher percentage of our returns. 

Our revenues are principally derived from three sources: (1) net premiums earned from the reinsurance and insurance policies we sell; (2) net investment income and realized and unrealized gains from the investment of our capital funds and the investment of the cash we receive on the policies which we sell; and (3) other income received from our joint ventures, advisory services and various other items. 

Our expenses primarily consist of: (1) net claims and claim expenses incurred on the policies of reinsurance and insurance we sell; (2) acquisition costs which typically represent a percentage of the premiums we write; (3) operating expenses which primarily consist of personnel expenses, rent and other operating expenses; (4) corporate expenses which include certain executive, legal and consulting expenses, costs for research and development, transaction and integration-related expenses, and other miscellaneous costs, including those associated with operating as a publicly traded company; (5) redeemable noncontrolling interests, which represent the interests of third parties with respect to the net income of DaVinciRe and Medici; and (6) interest and dividend costs related to our debt and preference shares. We are also subject to taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Since the majority of our income is currently earned in Bermuda, which does not have a corporate income tax, the tax impact to our operations has historically been minimal, however, in the future, our net tax exposure may increase as our operations expand geographically. 

The underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are discussed frequently by reference to its net claims and claim expense ratio, underwriting expense ratio, and combined ratio. The net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by dividing net claims and claim expenses incurred by net premiums earned. The underwriting expense ratio is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses (acquisition expenses and operational expenses) by net premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the net claims and claim expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio. A combined ratio below 100% generally indicates profitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income. A combined ratio over 100% generally indicates unprofitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income. We also discuss our net claims and claim expense ratio on an accident year basis. This ratio is calculated by taking net claims and claim expenses, excluding development on net claims and claim expenses from events that took place in prior fiscal years, divided by net premiums earned. 

Our business consists of the following reportable segments: (1) Catastrophe Reinsurance, which includes catastrophe reinsurance and certain property catastrophe joint ventures managed by our ventures unit; (2) Specialty Reinsurance, which includes specialty reinsurance and certain specialty joint ventures managed by our ventures unit; and (3) Lloyd’s, which includes reinsurance and insurance business written through Syndicate 1458. In addition, our Other category primarily includes our strategic investments, investments unit, corporate expenses, capital servicing costs, noncontrolling interests, certain expenses related to the acquisition of Platinum, results of our discontinued operations, and the remnants of our Bermuda-based insurance operations. 

Acquisition of Platinum 

On March 2, 2015, RenaissanceRe acquired Platinum pursuant to a definitive merger agreement entered into on November 23, 2014. As a result of the acquisition of Platinum, Platinum and its operating subsidiaries became wholly owned subsidiaries of RenaissanceRe. In connection with an intercompany restructuring, effective July 1, 2015, Platinum was merged with RenaissanceRe, with RenaissanceRe continuing as the surviving company. Refer to "Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Summary Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources, Impact of Platinum Acquisition on Liquidity and Capital Resources" and "Note 3. Acquisition of Platinum" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to the acquisition of Platinum. &#32; 

CORPORATE STRATEGY 

Our mission is to produce superior returns for our shareholders over the long-term. We believe that market leadership is required to produce the best expected returns. As such, we pursue markets where we believe being the best underwriter produces market leadership, thereby facilitating a competitive advantage and superior returns. 

To be the best underwriter, our strategy is to operate an integrated system of three competitive advantages: superior customer relationships; superior risk selection; and superior capital management. 

We believe all three competitive advantages are required to achieve our mission, and we aim to seamlessly coordinate the delivery of these competitive advantages for the benefit of our ceding insurers, brokers, investors in our sidecars and joint ventures, and shareholders. The strategy is supported by our core values, our principles and our culture. 

We believe our competitive advantages include: 

Superior Customer Relationships. We seek to be a trusted long-term partner to our customers for assessing and managing risk and delivering responsive solutions. &#32; We believe our modeling and technical expertise, our risk management products we provide our customers and our track record of keeping our promises have made us a provider of first choice in many lines of business to our customers worldwide. We seek to offer stable, predictable, and consistent risk-based pricing and a prompt turnaround on claims. 

Superior Risk Selection . We seek to build a portfolio of risks that produces an attractive risk-adjusted return on utilized capital. We develop a perspective of each risk using both our underwriters’ expertise and sophisticated risk selection techniques, including computer models and databases such as Renaissance Exposure Management System ("REMS&#169;"). We pursue a disciplined approach to underwriting and seek to select only those risks we believe will produce a portfolio with an attractive return, subject to prudent risk constraints. We manage our portfolio of risks dynamically, both within sub-portfolios and across the Company. 

Superior Capital Management. We seek to write as much attractively priced business as is available to us and then manage our capital accordingly. We generally seek to raise capital when we forecast increased demand in the market, at times by accessing capital through joint ventures or other structures, and seek to return capital to our shareholders or joint venture investors when the demand for our coverages appears to decline and when we believe a return of capital would be beneficial to our shareholders or joint venture investors. In using joint ventures, we intend to leverage our access to business and our underwriting capabilities on an efficient capital base, develop fee income, generate profit commissions, diversify our portfolio and provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our capital providers. We routinely evaluate and review potential joint venture opportunities and strategic investments. 

We believe we are well positioned to fulfill our objectives by virtue of the experience and skill of our management team, our integrated underwriting and operating platform, our significant financial strength, and our strong relationships with brokers and customers. In addition, we believe our superior service, our proprietary modeling technology, and our extensive business relationships, which have enabled us to become a leader in the property catastrophe reinsurance market, will be instrumental in allowing us to achieve our strategic objectives. In particular, we believe our strategy, high performance culture, and commitment to our customers and joint venture partners help us to differentiate ourselves by offering specialized services and products at times and in markets where capacity and alternatives may be limited. 

SEGMENTS 

Our business consists of the following reportable segments: (1) Catastrophe Reinsurance, which includes catastrophe reinsurance and certain property catastrophe joint ventures managed by our ventures unit; (2) Specialty Reinsurance, which includes specialty reinsurance and certain specialty joint ventures managed by our ventures unit; and (3) Lloyd’s, which includes reinsurance and insurance business written through Syndicate 1458. 

In addition, our Other category primarily reflects our strategic investments, investments unit, corporate expenses, capital servicing costs, noncontrolling interests, certain expenses related to the acquisition of Platinum, results of our discontinued operations, and the remnants of our Bermuda-based insurance operations. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , our Catastrophe Reinsurance, Specialty Reinsurance and Lloyd’s segments accounted for 43.2% , 38.1% &#32;and 18.7% , respectively, of our total consolidated gross premiums written. Contributions to our consolidated results from our Specialty Reinsurance and Lloyd’s segments have increased in recent years, and we expect them to continue to increase over time, on both an absolute and relative basis, although we cannot assure you that this trend will continue. Operating results relating to our segments are included in "Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 

Our portfolio of business continues to be characterized by relatively large transactions with ceding companies with whom we do business, although no current relationship exceeds 10% &#32;of our gross premiums written. Accordingly, our gross premiums written are subject to significant fluctuations depending on our success in maintaining or expanding our relationships with these customers. We market our reinsurance products worldwide exclusively through brokers, whose market has become increasingly consolidated in recent years. In 2015 , three brokerage firms accounted for 81.5% &#32;of our Catastrophe Reinsurance and Specialty Reinsurance segments’ gross premiums written. We believe that recent market dynamics, and trends in our industry in respect of recent and potential future consolidation, have increased our exposure to the risks of broker, client and counterparty concentration. 

The following table shows our gross premiums written split between our Catastrophe Reinsurance, Specialty Reinsurance and Lloyd’s segments, respectively:

Catastrophe Reinsurance Segment 

Property catastrophe reinsurance is our traditional core business, and is principally written through our wholly owned operating subsidiaries, joint ventures and Syndicate 1458. We believe we are one of the world’s leading providers of this coverage, based on total catastrophe gross premiums written. This coverage protects against large natural catastrophes, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis, as well as claims arising from other natural and man-made catastrophes such as winter storms, freezes, floods, fires, wind storms, tornadoes, explosions and acts of terrorism. We offer this coverage to insurance companies and other reinsurers primarily on an excess of loss basis. This means we begin paying when our customers’ claims from a catastrophe exceed a certain retained amount. We also offer proportional coverages and other structures on a catastrophe-exposed basis and may increase these offerings on an absolute or relative basis in the future. 

Our excess of loss property catastrophe reinsurance contracts generally cover all natural perils. Our most significant exposure is to losses from earthquakes and hurricanes and other windstorms, although we are also exposed to claims arising from other catastrophes, such as tsunamis, freezes, floods, fires, tornadoes, explosions and acts of terrorism in connection with the coverages we provide. Our predominant exposure under such coverage is to property damage. However, other risks, including business interruption and other non-property losses, may also be covered under our property reinsurance contracts when arising from a covered peril. We offer our coverages on a worldwide basis. Because of the wide range of possible catastrophic events to which we are exposed, including the size of such events and the potential for multiple events to occur in the same time period, our catastrophe reinsurance business is volatile and our results of operations reflect this volatility. Further, our financial condition may be impacted by this volatility over time or at any point in time. Claims from one or a number of severe catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on us and we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property and the effects of inflation will increase the severity of such effects. 

We seek to moderate the volatility of our risk portfolio through superior risk selection, diversification and the purchase of retrocessional coverages and other protections. In furtherance of our strategy, we may increase or decrease our presence in the catastrophe reinsurance business based on market conditions and our assessment of risk-adjusted pricing adequacy. We frequently purchase reinsurance or other protection for our own account to further reduce the financial impact that a large catastrophe or a series of catastrophes could have on our results. 

As a result of our position in the market and reputation for superior customer relationships, we believe we have superior access to catastrophe-exposed reinsurance business we view as desirable compared to the market as a whole. We use our proprietary underwriting tools and guidelines to attempt to construct an attractive portfolio from these opportunities. We dynamically model policy submissions against our current in-force underwriting portfolio, comparing our estimate of the modeled expected returns of the contract against the amount of capital we allocate to the contract, based on our estimate of its marginal impact on our overall risk portfolio. At times, our approach to portfolio management has resulted, and may result in the future, in us having a relatively large market share of catastrophe reinsurance exposure in a particular geographic region, such as Florida, where we historically have had a relatively large percentage of coverage exposures, or to a particular peril, such as U.S. hurricane risk, where we believe our analytical skills, claims-paying history, large capacity, strong ratings and other attributes offer a competitive advantage, or where the risks or class of risks otherwise adds efficiency to our portfolio. Conversely, from time to time we may have a disproportionately low market share in certain regions or perils where we believe our capital would be less effectively deployed. 

Our principal property catastrophe reinsurance products include catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance, excess of loss retrocessional reinsurance, quota share or proportional reinsurance and investments in insurance-linked securities. 

Specialty Reinsurance Segment 

We write specialty reinsurance for our own account and for DaVinci, covering principally certain targeted classes of business where we believe we have a sound basis for underwriting and pricing the risk we assume. Our portfolio includes various classes of casualty business, such as automobile liability, casualty clash, catastrophe exposed workers’ compensation, cyber liability, directors and officers liability, environmental liability, general liability, medical malpractice and professional indemnity, and other specialty lines of reinsurance such as accident and health, agriculture, aviation, financial guaranty, marine and energy, mortgage guaranty, multi-line regional, political risk, terrorism and trade credit, which we collectively refer to as specialty reinsurance. The acquisition of Platinum has accelerated our strategy with respect to specialty reinsurance and we expect to experience growth in lines of business such as accident and health, multi-line regional and traditional workers compensation, and increase our presence within certain existing lines of business, including casualty clash, environmental liability, general liability, medical malpractice, professional indemnity and other casualty lines of business. 

We believe we are seen as a market leader in certain of these classes of business. In recent years, we have expanded our specialty reinsurance operations, and we plan to continue to expand these operations over time. However, we cannot assure you we will succeed in growing these operations or that any growth we do attain will be profitable, or will contribute meaningfully to our results or financial condition, particularly in light of current and forecasted market conditions. Our specialty reinsurance premiums are prone to significant volatility as this business can be influenced by a small number of relatively large transactions. As with our catastrophe business, our team of experienced professionals seeks to underwrite these lines using a disciplined underwriting approach and sophisticated analytical tools. 

We generally target lines of business where we believe we can adequately quantify the risks assumed and where potential losses could be characterized as low frequency and high severity, similar to our catastrophe reinsurance coverages. However, we also provide other coverage where we believe our underwriting is robust and the market is attractive, and may grow in these lines over time. We also seek to identify market dislocations and write new lines of business whose risk and return characteristics are estimated to exceed our hurdle rates. Furthermore, we also seek to manage the correlations of this business with our overall portfolio, including our aggregate exposure to single and aggregated catastrophe events. We believe that our underwriting and analytical capabilities have positioned us well to manage our specialty reinsurance business. 

We offer our specialty reinsurance products principally on an excess of loss basis, as described above with respect to our property catastrophe reinsurance products, and we also provide proportional coverage, which we expect to grow on an absolute or relative basis within this segment in the future. These products frequently include tailored features such as limits or sub-limits which we believe help us manage our exposures. Any liability exceeding, or otherwise not subject to, such limits reverts to the cedant. As with our catastrophe reinsurance business, our specialty reinsurance frequently provides coverage for relatively large limits or exposures, and thus we are subject to potential significant claims volatility. 

We generally seek to write significant lines on our specialty reinsurance treaties. As a result of our financial strength, we have the ability to offer significant capacity and, for select risks, we have made available significant limits. We believe these capabilities, the strength of our specialty reinsurance underwriting team, and our demonstrated ability and willingness to pay valid claims are competitive advantages of our specialty reinsurance business. While we believe that these and other initiatives will support growth in our Specialty Reinsurance segment, we intend to continue to apply our disciplined underwriting approach which, together with current and forecasted market conditions, is likely to temper such growth in current and near-term periods. 

Lloyd’s Segment 

Our Lloyd’s segment includes insurance and reinsurance business written for our own account through Syndicate 1458. The syndicate enhances our underwriting platform by providing access to Lloyd’s extensive distribution network and worldwide licenses. RenaissanceRe Corporate Capital (UK) Limited ("RenaissanceRe CCL"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is the sole corporate member of Syndicate 1458. RenaissanceRe Syndicate Management Limited ("RSML"), a wholly owned subsidiary of RenaissanceRe, is the managing agent for Syndicate 1458. Syndicate 1458’s absolute and relative contributions to our consolidated results of operations have increased in recent years and we expect this trend to continue over time, although we cannot assure you we will succeed in executing our growth strategy in respect of Syndicate 1458, or that its results will be profitable, particularly in light of current and forecasted market conditions. 

Syndicate 1458 generally targets lines of business where we believe we can adequately quantify the risks assumed. We also seek to identify market dislocations and to write new lines of business whose risk and return characteristics are attractive and add to our portfolio of risks. Furthermore, we seek to manage the correlations of this business with our overall portfolio, including our aggregate exposure to single and aggregated catastrophe events. We believe that our underwriting and analytical capabilities have positioned us well to manage this business. 

Syndicate 1458 offers a range of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance products including, but not limited to, direct and facultative property, property catastrophe, agriculture, medical malpractice, general liability and professional indemnity. We also write business through delegated authority arrangements. Syndicate 1458 may seek to expand its coverages and capacity over time. As with our catastrophe and specialty reinsurance business, Syndicate 1458 frequently provides coverage for relatively large limits or exposures, and thus it is subject to potentially significant claims volatility. 

Other 

Our Other category primarily includes the results of: (1) our share of strategic investments in certain markets we believe offer attractive risk-adjusted returns or where we believe our investment adds value, and where, rather than assuming exclusive management responsibilities ourselves, we partner with other market participants; (2) our investment unit which manages and invests the funds generated by our consolidated operations; (3) corporate expenses, certain expenses related to the acquisition of Platinum, capital servicing costs and noncontrolling interests; (4) the results of our discontinued operations; and (5) the remnants of our Bermuda-based insurance operations. &#32; 

VENTURES 

We pursue a number of other opportunities through our ventures unit, which has responsibility for creating and managing our joint ventures, executing customized reinsurance transactions to assume or cede risk and managing certain investments directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe reinsurance. 

Property Catastrophe Managed Joint Ventures 

We actively manage property catastrophe-oriented joint ventures, which provide us with an additional presence in the market, enhance our client relationships and generate fee income and profit commissions. These joint ventures allow us to leverage our access to business and our underwriting capabilities on a larger capital base. Currently, our principal joint ventures include DaVinci, Top Layer Re, Medici, RenaissanceRe Upsilon Fund Ltd. ("Upsilon Fund") and Upsilon RFO. Renaissance Underwriting Managers, Ltd. ("RUM"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, acts as the exclusive underwriting manager for each of these joint ventures. 

DaVinci 

DaVinci was established in 2001 and principally writes property catastrophe reinsurance and certain low frequency, high severity specialty reinsurance lines of business on a global basis. In general, we seek to construct for DaVinci a property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio with risk characteristics similar to those of Renaissance Reinsurance’s property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio and a portfolio of certain lines of specialty reinsurance such as terrorism and catastrophe exposed workers’ compensation. In accordance with DaVinci’s underwriting guidelines, it can only participate in business that is underwritten by Renaissance Reinsurance. We maintain majority voting control of DaVinci’s holding company, DaVinciRe, and accordingly, consolidate the results of DaVinciRe into our consolidated results of operations and financial position. We seek to manage DaVinci’s capital efficiently over time in light of the market opportunities and needs we perceive and believe we are able to serve. Our noncontrolling economic ownership in DaVinciRe was 26.3% &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;( 2014 &#32;- 23.4% ). 

We expect our noncontrolling economic ownership in DaVinciRe to fluctuate over time. See "Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Capital Resources" for additional information with respect of DaVinci. 

Top Layer Re 

Top Layer Re was established in 1999 and writes high excess non-U.S. property catastrophe reinsurance. Top Layer Re is owned 50% by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company ("State Farm") and 50% by Renaissance Reinsurance. State Farm provides $3.9 billion of stop loss reinsurance coverage to Top Layer Re. We account for our equity ownership in Top Layer Re under the equity method of accounting and our proportionate share of its results is reflected in equity in earnings of other ventures in our consolidated statements of operations. 

Medici 

Medici is an exempted fund, incorporated under the laws of Bermuda. Medici’s objective is to invest substantially all of its assets in various insurance-based investment instruments that have returns primarily correlated to property catastrophe risk. Third-party investors subscribe for a portion of the participating, non-voting common shares of Medici. We maintain majority voting control of Medici’s parent, RenaissanceRe Fund Holdings Ltd. ("Fund Holdings"), therefore the results of Medici and Fund Holdings are consolidated in our financial statements. Our economic ownership in Medici was 46.1% &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;( 2014 &#32;- 53.2% ). 

Upsilon RFO 

Effective January 1, 2013, we formed and launched a managed joint venture, Upsilon RFO (formerly known as Upsilon Reinsurance II Ltd.), a Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurer ("SPI"), to provide additional capacity to the worldwide aggregate and per-occurrence primary and retrocessional property catastrophe excess of loss market. Upsilon RFO’s creation further enhances our efforts to match desirable reinsurance risk with efficient capital through a strategic capital structure. Original business is written directly by Upsilon RFO under fully-collateralized reinsurance contracts capitalized through the sale of non-voting shares to the 

Company and Upsilon Fund. Other than our equity investment, we have not provided any financial or other support to Upsilon RFO we were not contractually required to provide. 

Upsilon Fund 

Effective November 13, 2014, we incorporated Upsilon Fund, an exempted Bermuda limited segregated accounts company. Upsilon Fund was formed to provide a fund structure through which third party investors can invest in reinsurance risk managed by us. As a segregated accounts company, Upsilon Fund is permitted to establish segregated accounts to invest in and hold identified pools of assets and liabilities. Each pool of assets and liabilities in each segregated account is ring-fenced from any claims from the creditors of Upsilon Fund’s general account and from the creditors of other segregated accounts within Upsilon Fund. Third party investors purchase redeemable, non-voting preference shares linked to specific segregated accounts of Upsilon Fund and own 100% &#32;of these shares. Upsilon Fund is managed by RenaissanceRe Fund Management Ltd. in return for an expense override and profit commission. We have not provided any financial or other support to Upsilon Fund we were not contractually required to provide. Currently, Upsilon Fund is invested in Upsilon RFO and Medici. 

Strategic Investments 

Ventures also pursues strategic investments where, rather than assuming exclusive management responsibilities ourselves, we partner with other market participants. These investments are directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe reinsurance, and at times may also be directed at non-insurance risks. We find these investments attractive because of their expected returns, and because they provide us with diversification benefits and information and exposure to other aspects of the market. Examples of these investments include our investments in Tower Hill Insurance Group, LLC. ("THIG"), Tower Hill Holdings, Inc. ("Tower Hill"),Tower Hill Signature Insurance Holdings, Inc. ("Tower Hill Signature") and Tower Hill Re (collectively, the "Tower Hill Companies"), Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc. ("Universal"), Essent Group Ltd. ("Essent") and Trupanion Inc. ("Trupanion"). The carrying value of these investments on our consolidated balance sheet, individually or in the aggregate, may differ from the realized value we may ultimately attain, perhaps significantly so. Other than Universal, Essent and Trupanion, none of the securities we hold in respect of these investments are publicly traded. 

Other Transactions 

Ventures works on a range of other customized reinsurance and financing transactions. For example, we have participated in and continuously analyze other attractive opportunities in the market for insurance-linked securities and derivatives. We believe our products contain a number of customized features designed to fit the needs of our partners, as well as our risk management objectives. 

Our ventures unit business activities that appear in our consolidated underwriting results, such as DaVinci and certain reinsurance transactions, are included in our Catastrophe Reinsurance and Specialty Reinsurance segment results as appropriate; the results of our equity method investments, such as Top Layer Re, and other ventures are included in the Other category of our segment results. 

GEOGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN 

Our exposures are generally diversified across geographic zones, but are also a function of market conditions and opportunities. Our largest exposure has historically been to the U.S. and Caribbean market, which represented 59.4% &#32;of our gross premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2015 . A significant amount of our U.S. and Caribbean premium provides coverage against windstorms (mainly U.S. Atlantic hurricanes), earthquakes and other natural and man-made catastrophes. The following table sets forth the percentage of our gross premiums written allocated to the territory of coverage exposure:

NEW BUSINESS 

From time to time we consider diversification into new ventures, either through organic growth, the formation of new joint ventures, or the acquisition of or the investment in other companies or books of business of other companies. This potential diversification includes opportunities to write targeted, additional classes of risk-exposed business, both directly for our own account and through new joint venture opportunities. We also regularly evaluate potential strategic opportunities we believe might utilize our skills, capabilities, proprietary technology and relationships to support possible expansion into further risk-related coverages, services and products. Generally, we focus on underwriting or trading risks where we believe reasonably sufficient data is available and our analytical abilities provide us with a competitive advantage, in order for us to seek to model estimated probabilities of losses and returns in accordance with our approach in respect of our then current portfolio of risks. 

We regularly review potential strategic transactions that might improve our portfolio of business, enhance or focus our strategies, expand our distribution or capabilities, or provide other benefits. In evaluating potential new ventures or investments, we generally seek an attractive estimated return on equity, the ability to 

develop or capitalize on a competitive advantage, and opportunities which we believe will not detract from our core operations. We believe that our ability to attract investment and operational opportunities is supported by our strong reputation and financial resources, and by the capabilities and track record of our ventures unit. 

COMPETITION 

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we believe that competition is in general increasing and becoming more robust. Our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies, subsidiaries and/or affiliates of globally recognized insurance companies, reinsurance divisions of certain insurance companies, domestic and international underwriting operations, and a range of entities offering forms of risk transfer protection on a collateralized or other non-traditional basis. As our business evolves, we expect our competitors to change as well. 

We believe that our principal competitors in the property catastrophe and specialty reinsurance market include other companies active in the Bermuda market, currently including Allied World Assurance Company, AG, Arch Capital Group Ltd., Aspen Insurance Holdings Limited, Axis Capital Holdings Limited, Chubb Limited, Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd., Everest Re Group, Ltd., Hamilton Re Ltd. ("Hamilton Re"), PartnerRe Ltd., Third Point Reinsurance Ltd. ("Third Point"), Validus Holdings, Ltd., White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd. and XL Group plc, as well as a growing number of private, unrated reinsurers offering predominately collateralized reinsurance. We also compete with certain Lloyd’s syndicates active in the London market, as well as with a number of other industry participants, such as American International Group, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Hannover R&#252;ckversicherung AG ("Hannover Re"), Ironshore Inc., M&#252;nchener R&#252;ckversicherungs-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft in M&#252;nchen ("Munich Re") and Swiss Re Ltd. 

Hedge funds, pension funds and endowments, investment banks, investment managers (such as Nephila Capital Ltd.), exchanges and other capital market participants are increasingly active in the reinsurance market and the market for related risk, either through the formation of reinsurance companies (which include Greenlight Reinsurance Ltd. and new Bermuda-based entrants, including Aeolus Re Ltd., Hamilton Re, Swan Re Ltd. and Third Point) or through the use of other financial products, such as catastrophe bonds, other insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance investment funds. We expect competition from these sources to continue to increase. In addition, we continue to anticipate growth in financial products offered to the insurance market which are intended to compete with traditional reinsurance, such as exchange traded catastrophe options, insurance-linked securities, unrated privately held reinsurance companies providing collateralized reinsurance, catastrophe-linked derivative agreements and other financial products It is possible that these changing dynamics will meaningfully impact the markets in which we participate, possibly adversely. 

The tax policies of the countries where our customers operate, as well as government sponsored or backed catastrophe funds, also affect demand for reinsurance, sometimes significantly. Moreover, government-backed entities increasingly represent competition for the coverages we provide directly or for the business of our customers, reducing the potential amount of third party private protection our clients might need or desire. 

UNDERWRITING AND ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Underwriting 

Our primary underwriting goal is to construct a portfolio of reinsurance and insurance contracts and other financial risks that maximizes our return on shareholders’ equity, subject to prudent risk constraints, and to generate long-term growth in tangible book value per common share plus the change in accumulated dividends. We assess each new (re)insurance contract on the basis of the expected incremental return relative to the incremental contribution to portfolio risk. 

We have developed a proprietary, computer-based pricing and exposure management system, REMS&#169;. Since inception, we have continued to invest in and improve REMS&#169;, incorporating our underwriting and modeling experience, adding proprietary software and a significant amount of new industry data. REMS&#169; has analytic and modeling capabilities that help us to assess the risk and return of each incremental (re)insurance contract in relation to our overall portfolio of (re)insurance contracts. We combine the analyses 

generated by REMS&#169; with other information available to us, including our own knowledge of the client submitting the proposed program, to assess the premium offered against the risk of loss and the cost of utilized capital which the program presents. The REMS&#169; framework encompasses and facilitates risk capture, analysis, correlation, portfolio aggregation and capital allocation within a single system for all of our natural hazards and non-natural hazards (re)insurance contracts. 

We generally utilize a multiple model approach combining both probabilistic and deterministic techniques. The underlying risk models integrated into our underwriting and REMS&#169; framework are a combination of internally constructed and commercially available models. We use commercially available natural hazard catastrophe models to assist with validating and stress testing our base model and REMS&#169; results. We continually strive to improve our analytical techniques for both natural hazard and non-natural hazard models in REMS&#169; and while our experience is most developed for analyzing natural hazard catastrophe risks, we continue to invest in and evolve our capabilities for assessing non-natural hazard catastrophe risks. With the acquisition of Platinum and our recent growth in our Specialty Reinsurance and Lloyd’s segments, we have increased our modeling and underwriting resources and associated capabilities with respect to our specialty lines of business. 

We believe that REMS&#169; is a robust underwriting and risk management system that has been successfully integrated into our business processes and culture. Before we bind a (re)insurance risk, exposure data, historical loss information and other risk data is gathered from customers. Using a combination of proprietary software, underwriting experience, actuarial techniques and engineering expertise where we deem appropriate, the exposure data is reviewed and augmented. We use this data as primary inputs into the REMS&#169; modeling system as a base to create risk distributions to represent the risk being evaluated. We believe that the REMS&#169; modeling system helps us to analyze each policy on a consistent basis, assisting our determination of what we believe to be an appropriate price to charge for each policy based upon the risk to be assumed. REMS&#169; combines computer-generated statistical simulations that estimate loss and event probabilities with exposure and coverage information on each client’s (re)insurance contract to produce expected claims for (re)insurance programs submitted to us. Operationally, on a deal-by-deal basis, our models employ simulation techniques that have the ability to generate 40,000 years of loss activity. When deemed necessary, we stress test the 40,000 year simulations with simulations of up to 1,000,000 years. At a consolidated level, we frequently utilize simulations of 500,000 years to incorporate reserve risk, investment risk, expenses, and operational and other risks at a portfolio and risk assuming entity level. For natural hazards, we simulate a large range of potential industry losses in respect of events by region and peril. For some regions and perils, the extreme tails of these simulations include industry losses in excess of $600 billion. From these simulations, we generate a probability distribution of potential outcomes for each policy in our portfolio and for our total portfolio. In part, through the process described above and the utilization of REMS&#169;, we seek to compare our estimate of the expected returns in respect of a contract with the amount of capital we notionally allocate to the contract based on our estimate of its marginal impact on our portfolio of risks. A key advantage of our REMS&#169; framework is our ability to include additional perils, risks and geographic areas that may not be captured in commercially available natural hazards risk models. 

We periodically review the estimates and assumptions that are reflected in REMS&#169; and our other tools. For example, the 2011 and 2010 New Zealand Earthquakes and the Tohoku Earthquake provided new insight on certain aspects of hazard and vulnerability to the global earthquake science community. Utilizing internal research capabilities from our team of scientists at Weather Predict Consulting Inc. ("Weather Predict") and new research from the global earthquake science community, we updated several of our internal regional representations of earthquake risk in advance of the commercially available models. In late 2012, Storm Sandy gave rise to new data relating to storm surge, flood persistence and mid-Atlantic tropical storm meteorology. We subsequently updated our North Atlantic storm surge model to reflect this new data. 

Our underwriters use the combination of our risk assessment and underwriting process, REMS&#169; and other tools in their pricing decisions, which we believe provides them with several competitive advantages. These include the ability to: 

-  simulate a range of potential outcomes that adequately represents the risk to an individual contract; 

-  analyze the incremental impact of an individual reinsurance contract on our overall portfolio; 

-  better assess the underlying exposures associated with assumed retrocessional business; 

-  price contracts within a short time frame; 

-  capture various classes of risk, including catastrophe and other insurance risks; 

-  assess risk across multiple entities (including our various joint ventures) and across different components of our capital structure; and 

-  provide consistent pricing information. 

As part of our risk management process, we also use REMS&#169; to assist us, as a retrocedant, with the purchase of reinsurance coverage for our own account. 

Our underwriting and risk management process, in conjunction with REMS&#169;, quantifies and manages our exposure to claims from single events and the exposure to losses from a series of events. As part of our pricing and underwriting process, we also assess a variety of other factors, including: 

-  the reputation of the proposed cedant and the likelihood of establishing a long-term relationship with the cedant; 

-  the geographic area in which the cedant does business and its market share; 

-  historical loss data for the cedant and, where available, for the industry as a whole in the relevant regions and lines of business, in order to compare the cedant’s historical catastrophe loss experience to industry averages; 

-  the cedant’s pricing strategies; and 

-  the perceived financial strength of the cedant and factors such as the cedant’s historical record of making premium payments in full and on a timely basis. 

In order to estimate the risk profile of each line of non-natural hazard reinsurance (i.e., our specialty and casualty lines of business), we establish probability distributions and assess the correlations with the rest of our portfolio. In lines with catastrophe risk, such as excess workers’ compensation and terrorism, we seek to directly leverage our skill in modeling for our property catastrophe reinsurance risks, and seek to appropriately estimate and manage the correlations between these specialty lines and our catastrophe reinsurance portfolio. For other classes of business, in which we believe we have little or no natural catastrophe exposure, and therefore less correlation with our property catastrophe reinsurance coverages, we derive probability distributions from a variety of underlying information sources, including recent historical experience, and the application of judgment as appropriate. The nature of some of these businesses lends itself less to the analysis we use for our property catastrophe (re)insurance coverages, reflecting both the nature of available exposure information, and the impact of human factors such as tort exposure. We produce probability distributions to represent our estimates of the related underlying risks which our products cover, which we believe helps us to make consistent underwriting decisions and to manage our total risk portfolio. 

In addition, we also produce, utilize and report on models which measure our utilization of capital in light of regulatory capital considerations and constraints. Our position in respect of these regulatory capital models are reviewed by our risk management professional staff and periodically reported to and reviewed by senior underwriting personnel and executive management with responsibility for our regulated operating entities. 

Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") 

We believe that high-quality and effective risk management is best achieved when it is a shared cultural value throughout the organization. We have developed and utilize a series of tools and processes we believe supports a culture of risk management and to create a robust framework of ERM within our organization. We consider ERM to be a key process which is the responsibility of every individual within the Company. ERM is managed by our senior executive team under the oversight of our Board of Directors, and implemented by personnel from across our organization. We believe that ERM helps us to identify potential events that may affect us, to quantify, evaluate and manage the risks to which we are exposed, and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of our objectives. We believe that effective ERM can provide us with a significant competitive advantage. We also believe that effective ERM assists our efforts to minimize the likelihood of suffering financial outcomes in excess of the ranges which we have estimated in respect of specific investments, underwriting decisions, or other operating or business 

activities, although we do not believe this risk can be eliminated. We believe that our risk management tools support our strategy of pursuing opportunities and help us to identify opportunities we believe to be the most attractive. In particular, we utilize our risk management tools to support our efforts to monitor our capital position, on a consolidated basis and for each of our major operating subsidiaries, and to allocate an appropriate amount of capital to support the risks we have assumed in the aggregate and for each of our major operating subsidiaries. We believe that our risk management efforts are essential to our corporate strategy and our goal of achieving long-term growth in tangible book value per share plus the change in accumulated dividends for our shareholders. 

Our ERM framework comprises three primary areas of focus, as set forth below: 

(1) 

Assumed Risk. We define assumed risk as activities where we deliberately take risk against the Company’s capital base, including underwriting risks and other quantifiable risks such as credit risk and interest rate risk as they relate to investments, ceded reinsurance credit risk and strategic investment risk, each of which can be analyzed in substantial part through quantitative tools and techniques. Of these, we believe underwriting risk to be the most material to us. In order to understand, monitor, quantify and proactively assess underwriting risk, we seek to develop and deploy appropriate tools to, among other things, estimate the comparable expected returns on potential business opportunities, and estimate the impact that such incremental business could have on our overall risk profile. We use the tools and methods described above in "Underwriting" to seek to achieve these objectives. Embedded within our consideration of assumed risk is our management of the Company’s aggregate, consolidated risk profile. In part through the utilization of REMS&#169; and our other systems and procedures, we seek to analyze our in-force aggregate assumed risk portfolio on a daily basis. We believe this capability helps us to manage our aggregate exposures, as well as to rigorously analyze individual proposed transactions and evaluate them in the context of our in-force portfolio. This aggregation process captures line of business, segment and corporate risk profiles, calculates internal and external capital tests and explicitly models ceded reinsurance. Generally, additional data is added quarterly to our aggregate risk framework to reflect updated or new information or estimates relating to matters such as interest rate risk, credit risk, capital adequacy and liquidity. This information is used in day-to-day decision making for underwriting, investments and operations and is also reviewed quarterly from both a unit level and in respect of our consolidated financial position. We also regularly assess, monitor and review our regulatory risk capital and related constraints. 

Reserve Risk is a subcomponent of assumed risk . &#32;&#32;We define reserve risk as the risks related to our reserve for net claims and claim expenses, including the amount, both absolute and relative, of our outstanding reserve for net claims and claim expenses, and the impact of economic, social, legal and regulatory matters. Our reserve for net claims and claim expenses is subject to significant uncertainty as a result of these factors, and others. Although reserve risk can increase in both the absolute, and relative to its overall consideration in our ERM framework, we employ robust resources, procedures and technology to identify, understand, quantify and manage these risks. Our reserve risk has increased in recent years, and specifically the acquisition of Platinum added claims and claim expense reserves of $1.4 billion &#32;at March 2, 2015 , consisting of $117.4 million &#32;and $1.3 billion &#32;included in our Catastrophe Reinsurance and Specialty Reinsurance segments, respectively, which are subject to the reserving methodologies and sensitivities for each respective line of business described in "Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates, Claims and Claim Expense Reserves." Our reserve for net claims and claim expenses will continue to be subject to significant uncertainty and has the potential to develop adversely in future periods. 

(2) 

Business Environment Risk. We define this as the risk of changes in the business, political or regulatory environment that could negatively impact our short term or long-term financial results or the markets in which we operate. Accordingly, these risks are predominately extrinsic to the Company and in general, our ability to alter or eliminate these risks is limited. Rather, our efforts focus on monitoring developments, assessing potential impacts of any such changes, and investing in cost effective means to attempt to mitigate the consequences of and ensure compliance with any new requirements applicable to us. 

(3) 

Operational Risk. We are subject to a number of additional risks arising out of operational, regulatory, and other matters. We define operational risk to include the risk we fail to create, manage, control or mitigate the people, processes, structures or functions required to execute our strategic and tactical plans and assemble an optimized portfolio of assumed risk, and to adjust to and comply with the evolving requirements of business environment risk applicable to us. In light of the rapid evolution of our markets, business environment, and business initiatives, we seek to continually invest in the tools, processes and procedures to mitigate our exposure to operational risk on a cost-effective basis. As with assumed risk and business environment risk, operational risk presents intrinsic uncertainties, and we may fail to appropriately identify or mitigate applicable operational risk. 

Identification and monitoring of business environment risk and operational risk is coordinated by senior personnel including our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer ("CFO"), General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO"), Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer ("CAO"), Chief Risk Officer ("CRO") and Head of Internal Audit, utilizing resources throughout the Company. 

Although financial reporting is a key area of our focus, other operational risks are addressed through our disaster recovery program, human resource practices such as motivating and retaining top talent, our strict tax protocols and our legal and regulatory policies and procedures. 

Controls and Compliance Committee. We believe that a key component of our current operational risk management platform is our Controls and Compliance Committee. The Controls and Compliance Committee is comprised of our CFO, CCO, CAO, CRO, Head of Internal Audit, staff compliance professionals and representatives from our business units. The purpose of the Controls and Compliance Committee is to establish, assess the effectiveness of, and enforce policies, procedures and practices relating to accounting, financial reporting, internal controls, regulatory, legal, compliance and related matters, and to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the Company’s Code of Ethics and Conduct (the "Code of Ethics"), and other relevant standards. In addition, the Controls and Compliance Committee is charged with reviewing certain transactions that potentially raise complex and/or significant tax, legal, accounting, regulatory, financial reporting, reputational or compliance issues. 

Ongoing Development and Enhancement. We seek to reflect and categorize risks we monitor in part through quantitative risk distributions, even where we believe that such quantitative analysis is not as robust or well developed as our tools and models for measuring and evaluating other risks, such as catastrophe and market risks. We also seek to improve the methods by which we measure risks. Effective risk management is a core attribute of our culture and we believe it is a continual process that requires ongoing improvement and development. We seek from time to time to identify effective new practices or additional developments both from within our industry and from other sectors. We believe that our ongoing efforts to embed ERM throughout our organization are important to our efforts to produce and maintain a competitive advantage to achieve our corporate goals. 

RATINGS 

Financial strength ratings are an important factor in respect of the competitive position of reinsurance and insurance companies. Rating organizations continually review the financial positions of our reinsurers and insurers. We have received high claims-paying and financial strength ratings from A.M. Best Company, Inc. ("A.M. Best"), Standard and Poor’s Rating Services ("S&amp;P"), Moody’s Investors Service ("Moody’s") and Fitch Ratings Ltd. ("Fitch"). These ratings represent independent opinions of an insurer’s financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet policyholder obligations, and are not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. Subsequent to the announcement of the acquisition of Platinum, S&amp;P, A.M. Best, Moody’s and Fitch affirmed the ratings of RenaissanceRe and the operating subsidiaries of RenaissanceRe, with a stable outlook. See "Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Capital Resources, Ratings" for the ratings of our principal operating subsidiaries and joint ventures by segment, and details of recent ratings actions. In addition, S&amp;P assesses companies’ ERM practices, which is an opinion on the many critical dimensions of risk that determine overall creditworthiness. RenaissanceRe has been assigned an ERM rating of "Very Strong", which is the highest rating assigned by S&amp;P, and indicates that S&amp;P believes RenaissanceRe has very strong capabilities to 

consistently identify, measure, and manage risk exposures and losses within RenaissanceRe’s predetermined tolerance guidelines. 

RESERVES FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM EXPENSES 

We believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves. Claims and claim expense reserves represent estimates, including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time, of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell. We establish our claims and claim expense reserves by taking claims reported to us by insureds and ceding companies, but which have not yet been paid ("case reserves"), adding the costs for additional case reserves ("additional case reserves") which represent our estimates for claims related to specific contracts previously reported to us which we believe may not be adequately estimated by the client as of that date, and adding estimates for the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us ("IBNR"). 

In connection with the acquisition of Platinum on March 2, 2015 , we acquired claims and claim expense reserves of $1.4 billion , consisting of $117.4 million &#32;and $1.3 billion &#32;included in our Catastrophe Reinsurance and Specialty Reinsurance segments, respectively, which are subject to the reserving methodologies for each respective line of business as described in "Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates, Claims and Claim Expense Reserves." 

The following table summarizes our claims and claim expense reserves by line of business, split between case reserves, additional case reserves and IBNR:

Our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves are not precise in that, among other matters, they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends and other variable factors. Some, but not all, of our reserves are further subject to the uncertainty inherent in actuarial methodologies and estimates. Because a reserve estimate is simply an insurer’s estimate at a point in time of its ultimate liability, and because there are numerous factors which affect reserves and claims payments that cannot be determined with certainty in advance, our ultimate payments will vary, perhaps materially, from our estimates of reserves. If we determine in a subsequent period that adjustments to our previously established reserves are appropriate, such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , changes to prior year estimated claims reserves increased our net income by $162.4 million &#32;( 2014 &#32;- $143.8 million , 2013 &#32;- $144.0 million ), excluding the consideration of changes in reinstatement premium, profit commissions, redeemable noncontrolling interest - DaVinciRe, equity in net claims and claim expenses of Top Layer Re and income tax.

Our reserving methodology for each line of business uses a loss reserving process that calculates a point estimate for our ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims and claim expenses. We do not calculate a range of estimates. We use this point estimate, along with paid claims and case reserves, to record our best estimate of additional case reserves and IBNR in our consolidated financial statements. Under GAAP, we are not permitted to establish estimates for catastrophe claims and claim expense reserves until an event occurs that gives rise to a loss. &#32; 

Reserving for our reinsurance claims involves other uncertainties, such as the dependence on information from ceding companies, which among other matters, includes the time lag inherent in reporting information from the primary insurer to us or to our ceding companies and differing reserving practices among ceding companies. The information received from ceding companies is typically in the form of bordereaux, broker notifications of loss and/or discussions with ceding companies or their brokers. This information may be received on a monthly, quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes paid claims and estimates of case reserves. We sometimes also receive an estimate or provision for IBNR. This information is often updated and adjusted from time to time during the loss settlement period as new data or facts in respect of initial claims, client accounts, industry or event trends may be reported or emerge in addition to changes in applicable statutory and case laws. &#32; 

Our estimates of losses from large events are based on factors including currently available information derived from our claims information from certain customers and brokers, industry assessments of losses from the events, proprietary models, and the terms and conditions of our contracts. The uncertainty of our estimates for large events is also impacted by the preliminary nature of the information available, the magnitude and relative infrequency of the events, the expected duration of the respective claims development period, inadequacies in the data provided to the relevant date by industry participants and the potential for further reporting lags or insufficiencies; and in certain large events, significant uncertainty as to the form of the claims and legal issues, under the relevant terms of insurance and reinsurance contracts. In addition, a significant portion of the net claims and claim expenses associated with certain large events can be concentrated with a few large clients and therefore the loss estimates for these events may vary significantly based on the claims experience of those clients. Loss reserve estimation in respect of our 

retrocessional contracts poses further challenges compared to directly assumed reinsurance. The contingent nature of business interruption and other exposures will also impact losses in a meaningful way, which we believe may give rise to significant complexity in respect of claims handling, claims adjustment and other coverage issues, over time. Given the magnitude of certain events, there can be meaningful uncertainty regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and, accordingly, several of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates. In addition, our actual net losses from these events may increase if our reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations. &#32;&#32;&#32; 

Because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above, we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates, and we have generally experienced favorable net development on prior accident years net claims and claim expenses in the last several years. However, there is no assurance that this favorable development on prior accident years net claims and claim expenses will occur in future periods. &#32; 

Our reserving techniques, assumptions and processes differ among our Catastrophe Reinsurance, Specialty Reinsurance and Lloyd’s segments, and Other category. Refer to "Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates, Claims and Claim Expense Reserves" for more information on the risks we insure and reinsure, the reserving techniques, assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves, and our current estimates versus our initial estimates of our claims reserves, for each of these units. 

The following table represents the development of our GAAP balance sheet reserves for December 31, 2005 &#32;through December 31, 2015 . This table does not present accident or policy year development data. The top line of the table shows the gross reserves for claims and claim expenses at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years. This represents the estimated amounts of claims and claim expenses arising in the current year and all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date, including additional case reserves and IBNR reserves. Net reserves for claims and claim expenses of Platinum are included in the year of acquisition. The table also shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years. The "cumulative redundancy on net reserves" represents the aggregate change to date from the indicated estimate of the gross reserve for claims and claim expenses, net of reinsurance recoverable on the second line of the table. The table also shows the cumulative net paid amounts as of successive years with respect to the net reserve liability. At the bottom of the table is a reconciliation of the gross reserve for claims and claim expenses to the net reserve for claims and claim expenses, the gross re-estimated liability to the net re-estimated liability for claims and claim expenses, and the cumulative redundancy on gross reserves. 

With respect to the information in the table below, note that each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods, including the effect of foreign exchange rates.

Platinum’s gross reserve for claims and claim expenses and its reinsurance recoverable are included in this table at December 31, 2015 for the first time. For years prior to 2015, this table excludes the gross reserve for claims and claim expenses and reinsurance recoverable of Platinum. Accordingly, the cumulative redundancy on gross reserves (gross reserve for claims and claim expenses at the end of the year, as originally estimated, less the gross liability re-estimated as of subsequent years) for years prior to 2015 relates only to claims and claim expenses recorded by RenaissanceRe and its subsidiaries not acquired in connection with the acquisition of Platinum. In addition, the cumulative redundancy on net reserves and cumulative net paid losses disclosed in the 2014 column in the table above, excludes $44.3 million and $237.9 million, respectively, associated with Platinum for years prior to 2015. 

INVESTMENTS 

Our investment guidelines stress preservation of capital, market liquidity, and diversification of risk. The majority of our investments consist of highly rated fixed income securities. We also hold a significant amount of short term investments. Short term investments are managed as part of our investment portfolio and have a maturity of one year or less when purchased. In addition, we have an allocation to other investments including private equity partnerships, catastrophe bonds, a senior secured bank loan fund, and hedge funds, and to certain equity securities. We may from time to time re-evaluate our investment guidelines and explore investment allocations to other asset classes. Our investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. 

In connection with the acquisition of Platinum on March 2, 2015 , we acquired $2.7 billion &#32;of investments, including $1.8 billion &#32;of fixed maturity investments trading and $883.5 million &#32;of short term investments.

MARKETING 

We believe that our modeling and technical expertise, the risk management products we provide to our customers, and our reputation for paying claims promptly has enabled us to become a provider of first choice in many lines of business to our customers worldwide. We market our products worldwide primarily through reinsurance brokers and we focus our marketing efforts on targeted brokers and partners. We believe that our existing portfolio of business is a valuable asset and, therefore, we attempt to continually strengthen relationships with our existing brokers and customers. We target prospects that are capable of supplying detailed and accurate underwriting data and that potentially add further diversification to our book of business. 

We believe that primary insurers’ and brokers’ willingness to use a particular reinsurer is based not just on pricing, but also on the financial security of the reinsurer, its claim paying ability ratings and demonstrated willingness to promptly pay valid claims, the quality of a reinsurer’s service, the reinsurer’s willingness and ability to design customized programs, its long-term stability and its commitment to provide reinsurance 

capacity. We believe we have established a reputation with our brokers and customers for prompt response on underwriting submissions, for fast payments on valid claims and for providing creative solutions to our customers’ needs. Since we selectively write large lines on a limited number of property catastrophe and specialty reinsurance contracts, we can establish terms and conditions on those contracts that are attractive in our judgment, make large commitments to the most attractive programs and provide superior client responsiveness. We believe that our willingness and ability to design customized programs and to provide bespoke risk management products has helped us to develop long-term relationships with brokers and customers. 

Our brokers assess client needs and perform data collection, contract preparation and other administrative tasks, enabling us to market our products cost effectively by maintaining a smaller staff. We believe that by maintaining close relationships with brokers, we are able to obtain access to a broad range of potential reinsureds. In recent years, our distribution has become increasingly reliant on a small and relatively decreasing number of such relationships reflecting consolidation in the broker sector. We expect this concentration to continue and perhaps increase.

EMPLOYEES 

At February 18, 2016 , we employed 376 &#32;people worldwide (February 18, 2015 - 281, February 19, 2014 - 285). We believe our strong employee relations are among our most significant strengths. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We are not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements at any of our subsidiaries. We have historically looked for opportunities to strengthen our operations during periods of softening markets in anticipation of improving market conditions, however, we may from time to time reevaluate our operational needs based on various factors, including the changing nature of such market conditions and changes in our strategy or tactical plans. We expect to continue to experience a degree of employee growth in the U.K., the U.S. and other markets outside Bermuda, which may lead to new or expanded human resource requirements. 

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 

Our information technology infrastructure is important to our business. Our information technology platform, supported by a team of professionals, is maintained across various office locations. Additional information 

technology assets are maintained at the other office locations of our operating subsidiaries. We have implemented backup procedures that seek to ensure that our key business systems and data are backed up, generally on a daily basis, and can be restored promptly if and as needed. In addition, we generally store backup information at off-site locations, in order to seek to minimize our risk of loss of key data in the event of a disaster. 

We depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information technology platform. This includes communications and data processing systems used in operating our business. These systems consist of proprietary software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of our business (including REMS&#169;, our proprietary computer-based pricing and exposure management system). In addition, we frequently transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means, as required in connection with our business, with our internal operations and with facilitating the oversight conducted by our Board of Directors. Computer viruses, hackers, employee misuse or misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches, cyber attacks or other disruptions. 

Our business and support functions utilize information systems that provide critical services to both our employees and our customers. We are also required to effect electronic transmissions with third parties including brokers, clients, vendors and others with whom we do business. While we seek to ensure that our information is appropriately protected by these parties by performing third party risk assessments, we may be unable to establish secure capabilities with all of them; in addition, these third parties may not have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information. 

Cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy or other proper functioning of these systems could have a significant impact on our operations, and potentially on our results. Publicly reported instances of cyber security threats and incidents have increased over recent periods, and it is possible that cyber-related risks for us or the costs to us of complying with new or developing regulatory requirements have or will increase. In 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") drafted informal staff-level guidance for public companies to use when considering whether to disclose cyber attacks and their impact on a company's financial condition, and it is possible that the SEC or other agencies which regulate or oversee us will adopt new standards or requirements with which we would be required to comply. We also operate in a number of jurisdictions with strict data privacy and other related laws, which could be violated in the event of a significant cybersecurity incident, or by our personnel. Failure to comply with these obligations can give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant. 

We protect our information systems with physical and electronic safeguards as well as backup systems considered appropriate by management. However, it is not possible to protect against every potential power loss, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack or similar event that may arise. Moreover, the safeguards we use are subject to human implementation and maintenance and to other uncertainties. 

A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations. Cyber incidents may result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could damage our reputation potentially causing a loss of customers. Management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material effect on our operations, although there can be no assurances that a cyber incident that could have a material impact on us will not occur in the future. We do however periodically perform security penetration test scenarios and provide regular security risk staff education awareness sessions, to evaluate our preparedness and enhance both our system and user ability to detect, alert and respond to such an incident. 

We have implemented and periodically test our disaster recovery plans with respect to our information technology infrastructure. Among other things, our recovery plans involve arrangements with off-site, secure data centers in alternative locations. We believe we will be able to access our systems from these facilities in the event that our primary systems are unavailable due to various scenarios, such as natural disasters. However, we have not prepared for every conceivable disaster or every scenario which might arise in respect of the disaster for which we have prepared, and cannot assure you our efforts in respect of disaster recovery will succeed, or will be sufficiently rapid to avoid harm to our business.

All Bermuda companies must comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 1981. In addition, the Insurance Act 1978 and related regulations (collectively, the "Insurance Act"), regulate the business of our Bermuda insurance, reinsurance and management company subsidiaries. 

As a holding company, RenaissanceRe is not currently subject to the Insurance Act. However, the Insurance Act regulates the insurance and reinsurance business of our Bermuda-licensed operating insurance companies. RenaissanceRe’s Bermuda-licensed operating insurance subsidiaries include Renaissance Reinsurance, DaVinci and Platinum Bermuda, which are registered as Class 4 general business insurers, RenaissanceRe Specialty Risks and RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S., which are registered as Class 3B general business insurers, and Top Layer Re, which is registered as a Class 3A general business insurer under the Insurance Act. RenaissanceRe also has operating subsidiaries registered as SPIs under the Insurance Act, including most recently, Upsilon RFO. RUM and RenaissanceRe Underwriting Management Ltd. are each registered as insurance managers under the Insurance Act. 

The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards as well as auditing and reporting requirements and confers on the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the "BMA") powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. Significant requirements of the Insurance Act include the appointment of an independent auditor and loss reserve specialist (both of whom must be approved by the BMA), the filing of an annual financial return and provisions relating to the payment of distributions and dividends. In particular: 

-  Each Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 general business insurer is required to submit annual statutory financial statements as part of its statutory financial return no later than four months after the insurer’s financial year end (unless specifically extended). The annual statutory financial statements give detailed information and analyses regarding premiums, claims, reinsurance, reserves and investments. The statutory financial return includes, among other items: a report of the approved independent auditor on the statutory financial statements; a declaration of statutory ratios; a solvency certificate; the statutory financial statements themselves; the opinion of the approved loss reserve specialist; and details concerning ceded reinsurance. Class 3A, 3B and 4 insurers are also required to file a capital and solvency return in respect of their general business, which includes, amongst other items, the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement ("BSCR") model, a schedule of governance and risk management, a catastrophe risk return, a schedule of loss triangles or reconciliation of net loss reserves and a schedule of eligible capital. 

-  In addition to preparing statutory financial statements, all Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurers must prepare financial statements in respect of their insurance business in accordance with GAAP, International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") or other acceptable accounting standards, which are published on the BMA website. 

-  A general business insurer’s statutory assets must exceed its statutory liabilities by an amount, equal to or greater than the prescribed minimum solvency margin ("Minimum Solvency Margin"), which varies with the category of its registration. The Minimum Solvency Margin that must be maintained by a Class 4 insurer is the greater of (i) $100.0 million, or (ii) 50% of net premiums written (with a credit for reinsurance ceded not exceeding 25% of gross premiums), or (iii) 15% of net aggregate loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves, or (iv) 25% of the enhanced capital requirement (ECR"), which is established by reference to the BSCR model. The Minimum Solvency Margin for a Class 3A or Class 3B insurer is the greater of (i) $1.0 million, or (ii) 20% of the first $6.0 million of net premiums written; if in excess of $6.0 million, the figure is $1.2 million plus 15% of net premiums written in excess of $6.0 million, or (iii) 15% of net aggregate loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves, or (iv) 25% of the insurer’s ECR. 

-  Each Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurer must maintain its capital at a level at least equal to its ECR. Alternatively, under the Insurance Act, insurers may, subject to the terms of the Insurance Act and to the BMA’s oversight, elect to utilize an approved internal capital model to determine regulatory capital. In either case, the ECR shall at all times equal or exceed the respective Class 3A, Class 3B 

and Class 4 insurer’s Minimum Solvency Margin and may be adjusted in circumstances where the BMA concludes that the insurer’s risk profile deviates significantly from the assumptions underlying its ECR or the insurer’s assessment of its risk management policies and practices used to calculate the ECR applicable to it. While not specifically referred to in the Insurance Act, the BMA has also established a target capital level ("TCL") for each Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurer equal to 120% of the respective ECR. While a Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurer is not currently required to maintain its statutory capital and surplus at this level, the TCL serves as an early warning tool for the BMA and failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the TCL will likely result in increased BMA regulatory oversight. 

-  An insurer engaged in general business is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than 75% of the amount of its relevant liabilities ("Minimum Liquidity Ratio"). 

-  To enable the BMA to better assess the quality of an insurer’s capital resources, Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurers must maintain available capital in accordance with a "three tiered capital regime". All capital instruments are classified as either basic or ancillary capital, which in turn are classified into one of three tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3) based on their "loss absorbency" characteristics (the "Tiered Capital Requirements"). Eligibility limits are then applied to each tier in determining the amounts eligible to cover regulatory capital requirement levels. The highest capital is classified as Tier 1 capital, lesser quality capital is classified as either Tier 2 capital or Tier 3 capital. Under this regime, not more than certain specified percentages of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 capital may be used to satisfy the Class 3A, 3B and 4 insurers' Minimum Solvency Margin and ECR requirements. 

-  Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurers are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends if in breach of the required Minimum Solvency Margin or Minimum Liquidity Ratio (the "Relevant Margins") or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause the insurer to fail to meet the Relevant Margins. Further, Class 3B and Class 4 insurers are prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus (as shown on its previous financial year’s statutory balance sheet) unless it files (at least seven days before payment of such dividends) with the BMA an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet its Relevant Margins. Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurers must obtain the BMA’s prior approval for a reduction by 15% or more of the total statutory capital as set forth in its previous year’s financial statements. These restrictions on declaring or paying dividends and distributions under the Insurance Act are in addition to the solvency requirements under the Companies Act which apply to all Bermuda companies. 

-  Unlike other (re)insurers, SPIs are fully funded to meet their (re)insurance obligations and are not exposed to insolvency, therefore the application and supervision processes are streamlined to facilitate the transparent structure. Further, SPIs are currently not required to file annual loss reserve specialist opinions and the BMA has the discretion to modify such insurer’s accounting requirements under the Insurance Act. Like other (re)insurers, the principal representative of an SPI has a duty to inform the BMA in relation to solvency matters, where applicable. In December 2013, the BMA issued a notice in which it proposed to amend the statutory reporting requirements for SPIs. Under this notice, the BMA will likely require SPIs to submit additional schedules together with the existing statutory financial return. These enhanced filing requirements have not yet been finalized by the BMA. 

-  The BMA maintains supervision over the controllers (as defined herein) of all Bermuda registered insurers. Currently, the Insurance Act states that no person shall become a controller of any description of a registered insurer unless the BMA has been served notice in writing stating that the person intends to become such a controller. A controller includes the managing director and chief executive of the registered insurer or its parent company; a 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% shareholder controller; and any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the registered insurer or of its parent company are accustomed to act. In addition, all Bermuda insurers are also required to give the BMA written notice of the fact that a person has become, or ceased to be, a controller or officer of the registered insurer within 45 days of becoming aware of such fact. An officer in relation to a registered insurer includes a director, secretary, chief executive or senior executive by whatever name called. 

-  All registered insurers are required to give the BMA 30 days’ notice of certain matters that are likely to be of material significance (each a "Material Change") to the BMA in carrying out its supervisory function under the Insurance Act. The Insurance Act prescribes the Material Changes requiring advance notice. 

-  All Bermuda insurers are required to comply with the BMA’s Insurance Code of Conduct, which establishes duties, requirements and standards to be complied with to ensure each insurer implements sound corporate governance, risk management and internal controls. Failure to comply with these requirements will be a factor taken into account by the BMA in determining whether an insurer is conducting its business in a sound and prudent manner under the Insurance Act. 

-  Pursuant to the Insurance Act, the BMA acts as the group supervisor of the RenaissanceRe group of companies (the "RenaissanceRe Group") and it has designated Renaissance Reinsurance to be the "designated insurer" in respect of the RenaissanceRe Group. The designated insurer is required to ensure that the RenaissanceRe Group complies with the provisions of the Insurance Act pertaining to groups and all related group solvency and group supervision rules (together, the "Group Rules"). Under the Group Rules, the RenaissanceRe Group is required to annually prepare and submit to the BMA group GAAP financial statements, group statutory financial statements, a group statutory financial return and a group capital and solvency return. An insurance group must ensure that the value of the insurance group's assets exceeds the amount of the insurance group's liabilities by the aggregate of: (i) the individual Minimum Solvency Margin of each qualifying member of the group controlled by the parent company; and (ii) the parent company’s percentage shareholding in the member multiplied by the member’s Minimum Solvency Margin, where the parent company exercises significant influence over a member of the group but does not control the member (the "Group Minimum Solvency Margin"). A member is a qualified member of the insurance group if it is subject to solvency requirements in the jurisdiction in which it is registered. Every insurance group is also required to submit an annual group actuarial opinion when filing its group statutory financial return. The group actuary must be approved by the BMA. Insurance groups are required to maintain available statutory capital and surplus to an amount that is equal to or exceeds the value of its Group ECR, which is calculated at the end of its relevant year by reference to the BSCR model of the group (the "Group BSCR") or an approved internal capital model provided that the group ECR shall at all times be an amount equal to or exceeding the Group Minimum Solvency Margin. The group ECR is being phased in over a period of six years, which commenced with the 2013 financial year end. For the 2015 financial year end the applicable group ECR is equivalent to 70% of the amount determined by the Group BSCR or an approved internal capital model. This requirement will increase by increments of 10% in each of the following four years until 100% of the amount determined by the Group BSCR or an approved internal capital model for the ECR is required for the 2018 financial year end. The BMA expects insurance groups to operate at or above a group TCL, which exceeds the group ECR. The TCL for insurance groups is set at 120% of its group ECR. In addition, under the Tiered Capital Requirements described above, not more than certain specified percentages of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 capital may be used by an insurance group to satisfy the Group's Minimum Solvency Margin and group ECR requirements. Further, our Board of Directors has established solvency self assessment procedures for the RenaissanceRe Group that factor in all foreseeable material risks; Renaissance Reinsurance must ensure that the RenaissanceRe Group’s assets exceed the amount of the RenaissanceRe Group’s liabilities by the aggregate minimum margin of solvency of each qualifying member; and our Board of Directors has established and effectively implements corporate governance policies and procedures designed to ensure they support the overall organizational strategy of the RenaissanceRe Group. In addition, the RenaissanceRe Group is required to prepare and submit to the BMA a quarterly financial return comprising unaudited consolidated group financial statements, a schedule of intra-group transactions and a schedule of risk concentrations. 

-  The BMA has certain powers of investigation and intervention relating to insurers and their holding companies, subsidiaries and other affiliates, which it may exercise in the interest of such insurer’s policyholders or if there is any risk of insolvency or of a breach of the Insurance Act or the insurer’s license conditions. 

-  Under the provisions of the Insurance Act, the BMA may, from time to time, conduct "on site" visits at the offices of insurers it regulates. Over the past several years, the BMA has conducted several "on site" reviews in respect of our Bermuda-domiciled operating insurers. No remedial actions were communicated to us as a result of any of the on-site reviews to date. 

-  The BMA may cancel an insurer’s registration on certain grounds specified in the Insurance Act. 

The BMA has indicated that it will remain committed to the regulatory equivalence process in relation to Solvency II for Bermuda’s commercial insurance sector. As part of this process, the BMA made certain amendments to the implementation of Bermuda’s reporting regime for commercial insurers and insurance groups as it relates to statutory financial reporting, public disclosures, eligible capital, changes to the BSCR model and economic balance sheet. The enhancements to Bermuda’s regulatory regime involve among others the requirement for the submission of certain items in accordance with the Insurance Account Rules 2015, Insurance (Public Disclosure) Rules 2015 and amendments made to other relevant existing statutory instruments and rules. Most recently, the BMA has been granted full Solvency II equivalence for an unlimited period by the European Commission (the "EC") based on an assessment conducted by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority. The Bermuda Solvency II Delegated Act will enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the European Council within a period of three months of notification of the Delegated Act to the European Parliament and the European Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the European Council have both informed the EC that they will not object. The period can be extended by three months at the initiative of the European Parliament or the European Council. 

At the present time, there is no Bermuda income or profits tax, withholding tax, capital gains tax, capital transfer tax, estate duty or inheritance tax payable by us or by our shareholders in respect of our shares. We have obtained an assurance from the Minister of Finance of Bermuda under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 that, in the event that any legislation is enacted in Bermuda imposing any tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, such tax shall not, until March 31, 2035, be applicable to us or to any of our operations or to our shares, debentures or other obligations except insofar as such tax applies to persons ordinarily resident in Bermuda or is payable by us in respect of real property owned or leased by us in Bermuda. 

U.S. Regulation 

Admitted Company Regulation . Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. is a Maryland domiciled insurer licensed in 26 states and the District of Columbia and qualified or certified as a reinsurer in 24 states. As a U.S. licensed and authorized insurer, Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. is subject to considerable regulation and supervision by state insurance regulators. The extent of regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to a department of insurance in each state. Among other things, state insurance departments regulate insurer solvency standards, authorized investments, loss and loss expense reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, and deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders. State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of authorized insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of companies and other matters. The Maryland Insurance Administration, as Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.’s domestic regulator, is the primary financial regulator of Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. Costs associated with understanding and complying with the regulations and requirements imposed by the Maryland Insurance Administration and other state insurance departments, as well as any changes or amendments to such regulations, may result in increased costs or burdens for RenaissanceRe. 

Holding Company Regulation . We are subject to the insurance holding company laws of Maryland, the domestic state of Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. These laws generally require Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. to file with the Maryland Insurance Administration certain reports concerning its capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations. Generally, all affiliate transactions involving the insurers in a holding company system must be fair and, if material or of specified types, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the Maryland Insurance Administration. Further, Maryland law places limitations on the amounts of dividends or distributions payable by Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. Payment of ordinary dividends by Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. requires notice to the Maryland Insurance 

Administration. Extraordinary dividends, which must be paid out of earned surplus, generally require thirty days’ prior notice to and approval or non-disapproval of the Maryland Insurance Administration before being declared. An extraordinary dividend includes any dividend whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the lesser of (1) ten percent of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31 of the preceding year or (2) the insurer’s net investment income, excluding realized capital gains (as determined under statutory accounting principles), for the twelve month period ending December 31 of the preceding year and pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer’s own securities, plus any amounts of net investment income (subject to the foregoing exclusions), in the three calendar years prior to the preceding year which have not been distributed. 

Maryland law also requires prior notice and Maryland Insurance Administration approval of acquisitions of control of a Maryland-domestic insurer or an entity directly or indirectly controlling a Maryland-domestic insurer, including its holding company. Any purchaser of 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of an insurance company, its holding company or any other entity directly or indirectly controlling the insurance company is presumed to have acquired control, unless the presumption is rebutted. Therefore, any investor who intends to acquire 10% or more of RenaissanceRe’s outstanding voting securities may need to comply with these laws and would be required to file notices and reports with the Maryland Insurance Administration before such acquisition. In addition, RenaissanceRe’s Bye-Laws prohibit transfers of our capital shares if the transfer would result in a person owning or controlling shares that constitute 9.9% or more of any class or series of our shares. 

Enterprise risk management and reporting obligations applicable to insurance holding company systems were adopted by Maryland effective 2014. These obligations are meant to protect the licensed companies from enterprise risk, including requiring an annual enterprise risk report by the ultimate controlling person identifying the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the licensed companies. We filed our first enterprise risk report with the Maryland Insurance Administration prior to the July 1, 2015 due date. 

Reinsurance Regulation . Our Bermuda-domiciled insurance operations and joint ventures principally consist of Renaissance Reinsurance, DaVinci, Top Layer Re, RenaissanceRe Specialty Risks, RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S. and Upsilon RFO. All are admitted to transact insurance business in Bermuda. The insurance laws of each state regulate the sale of reinsurance to licensed ceding insurers by non-admitted alien reinsurers, acting from locations outside the state. With some exceptions, the sale of insurance or reinsurance within a jurisdiction where the insurer is not admitted to do business is prohibited. Our Bermuda-domiciled insurance operations and joint ventures do not maintain an office or solicit, advertise, settle claims or conduct other insurance activities in any jurisdiction, other than Bermuda, where the conduct of such activities would require that any company be so admitted. 

In 2013, we organized RenaissanceRe Underwriting Managers U.S. LLC, a specialty reinsurance agency domiciled in Connecticut, to provide specialty treaty reinsurance solutions on both a quota share and excess of loss basis, as well as to write business on behalf of RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S., a Bermuda-domiciled reinsurer launched in 2013, which operates subject to U.S. federal income tax, and Syndicate 1458. RenaissanceRe Underwriting Managers U.S. LLC is licensed by the Connecticut Department of Insurance as a reinsurance intermediary broker and is required to maintain its reinsurance intermediary broker license in force in order to conduct its reinsurance operations in Connecticut. 

Although, in general, reinsurance contract terms and rates are not subject to regulation by state insurance authorities, a primary U.S. insurer ordinarily will enter into a reinsurance agreement only if it can obtain credit on its statutory financial statements for the reinsurance ceded. State insurance regulators permit U.S. ceding insurers to take credit for reinsurance ceded to non-admitted, non-U.S. (alien) reinsurers if the reinsurance contract contains certain minimum provisions and if the reinsurance obligations of the non-U.S. reinsurer are appropriately collateralized. Qualifying collateral may be established by an alien reinsurer exclusively for a single U.S. ceding company. Alternatively, an alien reinsurer that is accredited by a state may establish a multi-beneficiary trust with qualifying assets equal to its reinsurance obligations to all U.S. ceding insurers, plus a trusteed surplus amount. Renaissance Reinsurance and DaVinci are each an accredited reinsurer in New York and Florida and have established multi-beneficiary trusts with a qualifying financial institution in New York for the benefit of their U.S. cedants. 

States have generally required alien reinsurers to provide collateral equal to one hundred percent of their reinsurance obligations to U.S. ceding insurers. However, thirty-two states have recently changed their credit for reinsurance laws to permit US ceding insurers to take full credit for reinsurance when a "certified" reinsurer posts reduced collateral amounts. Under these amended credit for reinsurance laws, qualifying alien reinsurers may reduce their collateral for future reinsurance agreements based on a secure rating assigned by the U.S. insurance regulator. The secure rating is assigned by the state upon an assessment of the reinsurer’s financial condition, financial strength ratings and other factors. In addition, the alien reinsurer must be domiciled in a jurisdiction that is "qualified" under state law. In December 2014, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the "NAIC") approved its initial list of qualified jurisdictions, including Bermuda, and states that have amended their credit for reinsurance laws may accept such conditional qualification in assessing reinsurers for certification. Florida has approved Renaissance Reinsurance and DaVinci for collateral reduction. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also addresses states’ extraterritorial regulation of credit for reinsurance and the solvency regulation of U.S. reinsurers. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits a state in which a U.S. ceding insurer is licensed, but not domiciled, from denying credit for reinsurance if the ceding insurer’s domestic state recognizes credit for reinsurance for the insurer’s ceded risk and is a state accredited by the NAIC (or has substantially similar financial solvency requirements). With limited exceptions, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act affecting reinsurance became effective July 21, 2011. 

Although these changes may benefit our Bermuda based reinsurers by prohibiting states’ extraterritorial application of credit for reinsurance laws and streamlining the credit for reinsurance process, states may also impose heightened standards on U.S. ceding insurers’ in their selection of reinsurers which could have an adverse impact on our business. 

Excess and Surplus Lines Regulation . RenaissanceRe Specialty Risks, domiciled in Bermuda, is not licensed in the U.S. but is eligible to offer coverage in the U.S. exclusively in the surplus lines market. RenaissanceRe Specialty Risks is listed on the NAIC’s International Insurers Department’s Quarterly List of Alien Insurers as an eligible alien surplus lines insurer. Under the Dodd Frank Act, states may not prohibit a surplus lines broker from placing insurance with an alien insurer that appears in the Quarterly List of Alien Insurers maintained by the International Insurers Department. In accordance with certain provisions of the NAIC Nonadmitted Insurance Model Act, which provisions have been adopted by a number of states, RenaissanceRe Specialty Risks has established, and is required to maintain, a trust funded to a minimum amount as a condition of its status as an eligible, non-admitted insurer in the U.S. Although surplus lines business is generally less regulated than the admitted market, strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements under the laws of every state, and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future. 

NAIC Ratios . The NAIC has established 13 financial ratios to assist state insurance departments in their oversight of the financial condition of licensed property and casualty U.S. insurance companies operating in their respective states. The NAIC’s Insurance Regulatory Information System ("IRIS") calculates these ratios based on information submitted by insurers on an annual basis and shares the information with the applicable state insurance departments. Each ratio has an established "usual range" of results and assists state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies. A ratio result falling outside the usual range of IRIS ratios is not considered a failing result; rather unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. Furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges. An insurance company may fall outside of the usual range for one or more ratios because of specific transactions that are in themselves immaterial. 

Dodd-Frank Act . On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act which imposed sweeping reforms on the financial services industries. Although the Dodd-Frank Act does not change the state-based system of insurance regulation in the U.S., it does establish federal measures that will impact the U.S. insurance business and preempt certain state insurance laws. Over time, the Dodd-Frank Act or those agencies responsible for its enforcement may lay the foundation for ultimately establishing some form of U.S. federal regulation of insurance. 

The Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council ("FSOC") to identify and respond to risks to the financial stability of the U.S. and to promote market discipline. FSOC is authorized to designate a nonbank financial company as "systemically significant" if its material financial distress could threaten the 

financial stability of the U.S. In 2013, FSOC designated three nonbank financial companies, including two insurance groups, as systemically significant and in 2014, FSOC designated a third insurance group as systemically significant. Those designated entities will be subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as well as enhanced prudential standards, including stress tests, liquidity requirements, annual resolution plans or "living wills," and enhanced public disclosures. FSOC’s potential recommendation of measures to address systemic risk in the insurance industry could affect our insurance and reinsurance operations as could a determination that we or our counterparties are systemically significant. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also created the first office in the Federal government focused on insurance - the Federal Insurance Office ("FIO"). Although FIO has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements, FIO does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance. Certain functions of FIO relate to systemic risk. Specifically, FIO is authorized to monitor the U.S. insurance industry and identify potential regulatory gaps that could contribute to systemic risk. In addition, FIO may recommend to FSOC the designation of systemically important insurers. 

FIO has a particular role in connection with international insurance matters. FIO represents the U.S. at the International Association of Insurance Supervisors ("IAIS"); in 2012, FIO participated in IAIS’s Financial Stability Committee and joined IAIS’s Executive Committee. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury and U.S. Trade Representative to enter into international agreements of mutual recognition regarding the prudential regulation of insurance or reinsurance (a "Covered Agreement"). On November 20, 2015, FIO and the U.S. Trade Representative advised Congress that they intend to initiate negotiations to enter into a Covered Agreement with the European Union. We are monitoring public reports on these negotiations which may affect our U.S. and EU domiciled insurance and reinsurance business. Significantly, FIO is authorized to preempt state measures that (i) are inconsistent with a Covered Agreement and (ii) disfavor non-U.S. insurers subject to a Covered Agreement. 

FIO is required to report to Congress annually on the insurance industry and any preemption actions regarding any Covered Agreement. In addition, on December 12, 2013, FIO delivered a special report to Congress on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the U.S. The FIO report noted, among other things that the system of U.S. insurance regulation can be modernized and improved in the short-term, while warning that if the various U.S. states do not act in the near term to effectively regulate matters on a consistent and cooperative basis, in FIO’s view, there will be a greater role for federal regulation of insurance. It is possible FIO will, in the future, issue recommendations in respect of the reinsurance market that would, if enacted, impact our markets or our operations significantly, perhaps adversely. At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act or the resulting regulations will impact our business. However, compliance with these new laws and regulations has resulted in additional costs. Although we do not expect these costs to be material to us as a whole, we cannot be certain that this expectation will prove accurate or that the Dodd-Frank Act will not impact our business more adversely than we currently estimate. 

Legislative and Regulatory Proposals . Government intervention in the insurance and reinsurance markets in the U.S. continues to evolve. Although U.S. state regulation is currently the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance, in addition to changes brought about by the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress has considered over the past years various proposals relating to the creation of an optional federal charter, repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption from the McCarran Ferguson Act, and tax law changes, including changes to increase the taxation of reinsurance premiums paid to off-shore affiliates with respect to U.S. risks. We are unable to predict what reforms will be proposed or adopted or the effect, if any, that such reforms would have on our operations and financial condition. 

Government intervention in the property insurance market, particularly with respect to natural catastrophe losses, a key market of ours, has occurred on the state and federal level over recent years. Most significantly, beginning in 2007, the state of Florida enhanced the authority of the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund ("FHCF") to offer coverage at below-market rates and expanded the ability of the state-sponsored insurer, Citizens, to compete with private insurance companies, and other companies that cede business to us. This legislation reduced the role of the private insurance and reinsurance markets in Florida, a key target market of ours. In succeeding years, Florida legislation has allowed Citizens to increase rates and cut back support for FHCF. The rate increases and cut back on coverage by FHCF and 

Citizens have supported, over this period, a relatively increased role for private insurers in Florida, a market in which we have established substantial market share. However, we cannot assure you that this increased role will continue or be maintained, or that adverse new legislation will not be passed. 

It is possible that other states, particularly those with Atlantic or Gulf Coast exposures, or California in respect of its seismic exposures, may enact new or expanded legislation based on the 2007 Florida model, or may otherwise enact legislation which would further diminish aggregate private market demand for our products. Alternatively, legislation adversely impacting the private markets could be enacted on a regional or Federal level. For example, in the past, bills have been proposed in Congress which would, if enacted, create a federal reinsurance backstop or guarantee mechanism for catastrophic risks, including those we currently insure and reinsure in the private markets. These measures were not enacted by Congress; however, it is possible that new bills will be introduced this Congressional session to create a federal catastrophe reinsurance program to back up state insurance or reinsurance programs, or to establish other similar or analogous funding mechanisms or structures. If enacted, any of these bills, or legislation similar to these proposals, would, we believe, likely contribute to the growth of state entities offering below market priced insurance and reinsurance in a manner adverse to us and market participants more generally, and could accordingly adversely impact our financial results, perhaps materially. Moreover, we believe that numerous modeled potential catastrophes could exceed the actual or politically acceptable bonded capacity of Citizens and of the FHCF, which could lead either to a severe dislocation or the increased likelihood of federal intervention in the Florida market, either of which would adversely impact the private insurance and reinsurance industry. See "Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Current Outlook, Legislative and Regulatory Update" for further information regarding recent legislative and regulatory proposals. 

The potential for further expansion into additional insurance markets could expose us or our subsidiaries to increasing regulatory oversight, including the oversight of countries other than Bermuda and the U.S. However, we intend to continue to conduct our operations so as to minimize the likelihood that Renaissance Reinsurance, DaVinci, Top Layer Re, RenaissanceRe Specialty Risks, RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S., Upsilon RFO, or any of our other Bermudian subsidiaries will become subject to direct U.S. regulation. 

U.K. Regulation 

Lloyd’s Regulation 

General . The operations of RSML are subject to oversight by Lloyd’s, substantially effected through the Lloyd’s Franchise Board. RSML’s business plan for Syndicate 1458, including maximum underwriting capacity, requires annual approval by the Lloyd’s Franchise Board. The Lloyd’s Franchise Board may require changes to any business plan presented to it or additional capital to be provided to support the underwriting plan. Lloyd’s also imposes various charges and assessments on its members. If material changes in the business plan for Syndicate 1458 were required by the Lloyd’s Franchise Board, or if charges and assessments payable to Lloyd’s by RenaissanceRe CCL were to increase significantly, these events could have an adverse effect on the operations and financial results of RSML. We have deposited certain assets with Lloyd’s to support RenaissanceRe CCL’s underwriting business at Lloyd’s. Dividends from a Lloyd’s managing agent and a Lloyd’s corporate member can be declared and paid provided the relevant company has sufficient profits available for distribution. 

By entering into a membership agreement with Lloyd’s, RenaissanceRe CCL has undertaken to comply with all Lloyd’s bye-laws and regulations as well as the provisions of the Lloyd’s Acts and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended by the Financial Services Act 2012 (the "FSMA"), in particular that are applicable to it. 

Capital Requirements. The underwriting capacity of a member of Lloyd’s must be supported by providing a deposit (referred to as "Funds at Lloyd’s") in the form of cash, securities or letters of credit in an amount determined under the capital adequacy regime of the U.K.’s Prudential Regulation Authority (the "PRA"). The amount of such deposit is calculated for each member through the completion of an annual capital adequacy exercise. Under these requirements, Lloyd’s must demonstrate that each member has sufficient assets to meet its underwriting liabilities plus a required solvency margin. 

Restrictions. A Reinsurance to Close ("RITC") generally is put in place after the third year of operations of a syndicate year of account. On successful conclusion of a RITC, any profit from the syndicate’s operations 

for that year of account can be remitted by the managing agent to the syndicate’s members. If the syndicate’s managing agency concludes that an appropriate RITC cannot be determined or negotiated on commercially acceptable terms in respect of a particular underwriting year, it must determine that the underwriting year remain open and be placed into run-off. During this period, there cannot be a release of the Funds at Lloyd’s of a member of that syndicate without the consent of Lloyd’s. 

The financial security of the Lloyd’s market as a whole is regularly assessed by three independent rating agencies (A.M. Best, S&amp;P and Fitch). Syndicates at Lloyd’s take their financial security rating from the rating of the Lloyd’s Market. A satisfactory credit rating issued by an accredited rating agency is necessary for Lloyd’s syndicates to be able to trade in certain classes of business at current levels. RSML and RenaissanceRe CCL would be adversely affected if Lloyd’s current ratings were downgraded. 

Intervention Powers . The Council of Lloyd’s has wide discretionary powers to regulate members’ underwriting at Lloyd’s. It may, for instance, change the basis on which syndicate expenses are allocated or vary the Funds at Lloyd’s requirements or the investment criteria applicable to the provision of Funds at Lloyd’s. Exercising any of these powers might affect the return on the corporate member’s participation in a given underwriting year. If a member of Lloyd’s is unable to pay its debts to policyholders, the member may obtain financial assistance from the Lloyd’s Central Fund, which in many respects acts as an equivalent to a state guaranty fund in the U.S. If Lloyd’s determines that the Central Fund needs to be increased, it has the power to assess premium levies on current Lloyd’s members. The Council of Lloyd’s has discretion to call or assess up to 3% of a member’s underwriting capacity in any one year as a Central Fund contribution. 

PRA and FCA Regulation 

The PRA currently has ultimate responsibility for the prudential supervision of the Lloyd’s market and the Financial Conduct Authority (the "FCA") has responsibility for market conduct regulation. Both the PRA and FCA have substantial powers of intervention in relation to Lloyd’s managing agents, such as RSML, including the power to remove an agent’s authorization to manage Lloyd’s syndicates. In addition, each year the PRA requires Lloyd’s to satisfy an annual solvency test which measures whether Lloyd’s has sufficient assets in the aggregate to meet all outstanding liabilities of its members, both current and run-off. If Lloyd’s fails this test, the PRA may require the entire Lloyd’s market to cease underwriting or individual Lloyd’s members may be required to cease or reduce their underwriting. 

Lloyd’s as a whole is authorized by the PRA and regulated by both the FCA and the PRA. Lloyd’s is required to implement certain rules prescribed by the PRA and by the FCA; such rules are to be implemented by Lloyd’s pursuant to its powers under the Lloyd’s Act 1982 relating to the operation of the Lloyd’s market. Lloyd’s prescribes, in respect of its managing agents and corporate members, certain minimum standards relating to their management and control, solvency and various other requirements. The PRA and the FCA directly monitor Lloyd’s managing agents’ compliance with the systems and controls prescribed by Lloyd’s. If it appears to either the PRA or the FCA that either Lloyd’s is not fulfilling its delegated regulatory responsibilities or that managing agents are not complying with the applicable regulatory rules and guidance, the PRA or the FCA may intervene at their discretion. Future regulatory changes or rulings by the PRA or FCA could impact RSML’s business strategy or financial assumptions, possibly resulting in an adverse effect on RSML’s financial condition and operating results. 

Change of Control . The PRA and the FCA currently regulate the acquisition of control of any Lloyd’s managing agent which is authorized under the FSMA. Any company or individual that, together with its or his associates, directly or indirectly acquires 10% or more of the shares in a Lloyd’s managing agent or its parent company, or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of 10% or more of the voting power in such Lloyd’s managing agent or its parent company, would be considered to have acquired control for the purposes of the relevant legislation, as would a person who had significant influence over the management of such Lloyd’s managing agent or its parent company by virtue of their shareholding or voting power in either. A purchaser of 10% or more RenaissanceRe Common Shares or voting power would therefore be considered to have acquired control of RSML. Under the FSMA, any person or entity proposing to acquire control over a Lloyd’s managing agent must give prior notification to the PRA and the FCA of their or the entity’s intention to do so. The PRA and FCA would then have 60 working days to consider the application to acquire control. Failure to make the relevant prior application could result in action being taken against RSML by the PRA or the FCA or both of them. Lloyd’s approval is also required before any person can 

acquire control (using the same definition as for the PRA and FCA) of a Lloyd’s managing agent or Lloyd’s corporate member. 

Other Applicable Laws. Lloyd’s worldwide insurance and reinsurance business is subject to various regulations, laws, treaties and other applicable policies of the EU, as well as of each nation, state and locality in which it operates. Material changes in governmental requirements and laws could have an adverse effect on Lloyd’s and market participants, including RSML and RenaissanceRe CCL. 

Solvency II 

Solvency II was adopted by the European Parliament in April of 2009 and came into effect on January 1, 2016. Solvency II represents a risk-based approach to insurance regulation and capital adequacy. Its principal goals are to improve the correlation between capital and risk, effect group supervision of insurance and reinsurance affiliates, implement a uniform capital adequacy structure for (re)insurers across the EU Member States, establish consistent corporate governance standards for insurance and reinsurance companies, and establish transparency through standard reporting of insurance operations. Under Solvency II, an insurer’s or reinsurer’s capital adequacy in relation to various insurance and business risks may be measured with an internal model developed by the insurer or reinsurer and approved for use by the Member State’s regulator or pursuant to a standard formula developed by the EC. The PRA granted approval to Lloyd’s internal model application in December 2015. There are some areas of Solvency II concerning compliance with supervisory reporting and disclosure requirements where Lloyd’s approach is yet to be finalized. Certain of these reporting obligations will come into effect in 2017. 

Singapore Regulation 

Branches of Renaissance Reinsurance and DaVinci based in the Republic of Singapore (the "Singapore Branches") have each received a license to carry on insurance business as a general reinsurer. The activities of the Singapore Branches are primarily regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore pursuant to Singapore’s Insurance Act. Additionally, the Singapore Branches are each regulated by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (the "ACRA") as a foreign company pursuant to Singapore’s Companies Act. Prior to the establishment of the Singapore Branches, Renaissance Reinsurance had maintained a representative office in Singapore commencing April 2012. The activities and regulatory requirements of the Singapore Branches are not considered to be material to us. 

Renaissance Services of Asia Pte. Ltd., our Singapore-based service company, was established as a private company limited by shares in Singapore on March 15, 2012 and is registered with the ACRA and subject to Singapore’s Companies Act. 

ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE CHANGE MATTERS 

Our principal economic exposures arise from our coverages for natural disasters and catastrophes. We believe, and believe the consensus view of current scientific studies substantiates, that changes in climate conditions, primarily global temperatures and expected sea levels, are likely to increase the severity, and possibly the frequency, of weather related natural disasters and catastrophes relative to the historical experience over the past 100 years. Coupled with currently projected demographic trends in catastrophe-exposed regions, we believe that this expected increase in severe weather contributes to factors which will increase the average economic value of expected losses, increase the number of people exposed per year to natural disasters and in general exacerbate disaster risk, including risks to infrastructure, global supply chains and agricultural production. 

Accordingly, we expect an increase in claims from our property and casualty lines of business, especially from properties located in coastal areas. While a substantial portion of our coverages may be adversely impacted by climate change, we have taken certain measures to mitigate losses through our underwriting process, and by continuously monitoring and adjusting our risk management models. However, despite our best efforts to ensure that our assessments accurately reflect environmental risks, we cannot predict with certainty the frequency or severity of tropical cyclones or other catastrophes. Unanticipated environmental incidents could lead to additional insured losses that exceed our current estimates, resulting in disruptions or adverse impacts on our business, the market, or our clients. Further, certain investments, such as 

catastrophe-linked securities and property catastrophe managed joint ventures related to hurricane coverage, or other assets in our investment portfolio, could also be adversely impacted by climate change. 

In addition to the impacts that environmental incidents have on our business, there has been a proliferation of governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to climate change and greenhouse gases, which will also affect our business. Although most regulations related to climate change and greenhouse gases do not directly apply to our business, these regulations could indirectly impact our business. While we cannot protect against all unforeseen risks, we nonetheless believe that our existing policies and procedures are properly designed to identify and manage environmental and climate related risks, in particular, potential financial liability in connection with our reinsurance and insurance business. 

GLOSSARY OF SELECTED INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE TERMS Accident year 

Year of occurrence of a loss. Claim payments and reserves for claims and claim expenses are allocated to the year in which the loss occurred for losses occurring contracts and in the year the loss was reported for claims made contracts. 

Acquisition expenses 

The aggregate expenses incurred by a company for acquiring new business, including commissions, underwriting expenses, premium taxes and administrative expenses. 

Additional case reserves 

Additional case reserves represent management’s estimate of reserves for claims and claim expenses that are allocated to specific contracts, less paid and reported losses by the client. 

Attachment point 

The dollar amount of loss (per occurrence or in the aggregate, as the case may be) above which excess of loss reinsurance becomes operative. 

Bordereau 

A report providing premium or loss data with respect to identified specific risks. This report is periodically furnished to a reinsurer by the ceding insurers or reinsurers. 

Bound 

A (re)insurance policy is considered bound, and the (re)insurer responsible for the risks of the policy, when both parties agree to the terms and conditions set forth in the policy. 

Broker 

An intermediary who negotiates contracts of insurance or reinsurance, receiving a commission for placement and other services rendered, between (1) a policy holder and a primary insurer, on behalf of the insured party, (2) a primary insurer and reinsurer, on behalf of the primary insurer, or (3) a reinsurer and a retrocessionaire, on behalf of the reinsurer. 

Capacity 

The percentage of surplus, or the dollar amount of exposure, that an insurer or reinsurer is willing or able to place at risk. Capacity may apply to a single risk, a program, a line of business or an entire book of business. Capacity may be constrained by legal restrictions, corporate restrictions or indirect restrictions. 

Case reserves 

Loss reserves, established with respect to specific, individual reported claims. 

Casualty insurance or reinsurance 

Insurance or reinsurance that is primarily concerned with the losses caused by injuries to third persons and their property (in other words, persons other than the policyholder) and the legal liability imposed on the insured resulting therefrom. Also referred to as liability insurance. 

Catastrophe 

A severe loss, typically involving multiple claimants. Common perils include earthquakes, hurricanes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, floods, fires, tornadoes, explosions and other natural or man-made disasters. Catastrophe losses may also arise from acts of war, acts of terrorism and political instability. 

Catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance 

A form of excess of loss reinsurance that, subject to a specified limit, indemnifies the ceding company for the amount of loss in excess of a specified retention with respect to an accumulation of losses resulting from a "catastrophe." 

Catastrophe-linked securities; cat-linked securities 

Cat-linked securities are generally privately placed fixed income securities where all or a portion of the repayment of the principal is linked to catastrophic events. This includes securities where the repayment is linked to the occurrence and/or size of, for example, one or more hurricanes or earthquakes, or insured industry losses associated with these catastrophic events. 

Cede; cedant; ceding company 

When a party reinsures its liability with another, it "cedes" business and is referred to as the "cedant" or "ceding company." 

Claim 

Request by an insured or reinsured for indemnification by an insurance company or a reinsurance company for losses incurred from an insured peril or event. 

Claims made contracts 

Contracts that cover claims for losses occurring during a specified period that are reported during the term of the contract. 

Claims and claim expense ratio, net 

The ratio of net claims and claim expenses to net premiums earned determined in accordance with either statutory accounting principles or GAAP. 

Claim reserves 

Liabilities established by insurers and reinsurers to reflect the estimated costs of claim payments and the related expenses that the insurer or reinsurer will ultimately be required to pay in respect of insurance or reinsurance policies it has issued. Claims reserves consist of case reserves, established with respect to individual reported claims, additional case reserves and "IBNR" reserves. For reinsurers, loss expense reserves are generally not significant because substantially all of the loss expenses associated with particular claims are incurred by the primary insurer and reported to reinsurers as losses. 

Combined ratio 

The combined ratio is the sum of the net claims and claim expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio. A combined ratio below 100% generally indicates profitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income. A combined ratio over 100% generally indicates unprofitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income. 

Decadal 

Refers to events occurring over a 10-year period, such as an oscillation whose period is roughly 10 years. 

Delegated authority 

A contractual arrangement between an insurer or reinsurer and an agent whereby the agent is authorized to bind insurance or reinsurance on behalf of the insurer or reinsurer. The authority is normally limited to a particular class or classes of business and a particular territory. The exercise of the authority to bind insurance or reinsurance is normally subject to underwriting guidelines and other restrictions such as maximum premium income. Under the delegated authority the agent is responsible for the issuing of policy documentation, the collection of premium and may also be responsible for the settlement of claims. 

Excess and surplus lines reinsurance 

Any type of coverage that cannot be placed with an insurer admitted to do business in a certain jurisdiction. Risks placed in excess and surplus lines markets are often substandard in respect to adverse loss experience, unusual, or unable to be placed in conventional markets due to a shortage of capacity. 

Excess of loss 

Reinsurance or insurance that indemnifies the reinsured or insured against all or a specified portion of losses on underlying insurance policies in excess of a specified amount, which is called a "level" or "retention." Also known as non-proportional reinsurance. Excess of loss reinsurance is written in layers. A reinsurer or group of reinsurers accepts a layer of coverage up to a specified amount. The total coverage purchased by the cedant is referred to as a "program" and will typically be placed with predetermined reinsurers in pre-negotiated layers. Any liability exceeding the outer limit of the program reverts to the ceding company, which also bears the credit risk of a reinsurer’s insolvency. 

Exclusions 

Those risks, perils, or classes of insurance with respect to which the reinsurer will not pay loss or provide reinsurance, notwithstanding the other terms and conditions of reinsurance. 

Expense override 

An amount paid to a ceding company in addition to the acquisition cost to compensate for overhead expenses. 

Frequency 

The number of claims occurring during a given coverage period. 

Funds at Lloyd’s 

Funds of an approved form that are lodged and held in trust at Lloyd’s as security for a member’s underwriting activities. They comprise the members’ deposit, personal reserve fund and special reserve fund and may be drawn down in the event that the member’s syndicate level premium trust funds are insufficient to cover its liabilities. The amount of the deposit is related to the member’s premium income limit and also the nature of the underwriting account.

Lloyd’s 

Depending on the context, this term may refer to (a) the society of individual and corporate underwriting members that insure and reinsure risks as members of one or more syndicates (i.e., Lloyd’s is not an insurance company); (b) the underwriting room in the Lloyd’s building in which managing agents underwrite insurance and reinsurance on behalf of their syndicate members (in this sense Lloyd’s should be understood as a market place); or (c) the Corporation of Lloyd’s which regulates and provides support services to the Lloyd’s market. 

Loss; losses 

An occurrence that is the basis for submission and/or payment of a claim. Whether losses are covered, limited or excluded from coverage is dependent on the terms of the policy.

Net premiums earned 

The portion of net premiums written during or prior to a given period that was actually recognized as income during such period. 

Net premiums written 

Gross premiums written for a given period less premiums ceded to reinsurers and retrocessionaires during such period. 

Non-proportional reinsurance 

See "Excess of loss." 

Perils 

This term refers to the causes of possible loss in the property field, such as fire, windstorm, collision, hail, etc. In the casualty field, the term "hazard" is more frequently used. 

Profit commission 

A provision found in some reinsurance agreements that provides for profit sharing. Parties agree to a formula for calculating profit, an allowance for the reinsurer’s expenses, and the cedant’s share of such profit after expenses. 

Property insurance or reinsurance 

Insurance or reinsurance that provides coverage to a person with an insurable interest in tangible property for that person’s property loss, damage or loss of use. 

Property per risk 

Reinsurance on a treaty basis of individual property risks insured by a ceding company. 

Proportional reinsurance 

A generic term describing all forms of reinsurance in which the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the original premiums and losses of the reinsured. (Also known as pro rata reinsurance, quota share reinsurance or participating reinsurance.) In proportional reinsurance, the reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding commission. The ceding commission generally is based on the ceding company’s cost of acquiring the business being reinsured (including commissions, premium taxes, assessments and miscellaneous administrative expense) and also may include a profit factor. See also "Quota Share Reinsurance". 

Quota share reinsurance 

A form of proportional reinsurance in which the reinsurer assumes an agreed percentage of each insurance policy being reinsured and shares all premiums and losses according with the reinsured. See also "Proportional Reinsurance". 

Reinstatement premium 

The premium charged for the restoration of the reinsurance limit of a catastrophe contract to its full amount after payment by the reinsurer of losses as a result of an occurrence. 

Reinsurance 

An arrangement in which an insurance company, the reinsurer, agrees to indemnify another insurance or reinsurance company, the ceding company, against all or a portion of the insurance or reinsurance risks underwritten by the ceding company under one or more policies. Reinsurance can provide a ceding company with several benefits, including a reduction in net liability on insurances and catastrophe protection from large or multiple losses. Reinsurance also provides a ceding company with additional underwriting capacity by permitting it to accept larger risks and write more business than would be possible without an equivalent increase in capital and surplus, and facilitates the maintenance of acceptable financial ratios by the ceding company. Reinsurance does not legally discharge the primary insurer from its liability with respect to its obligations to the insured. 

Reinsurance to Close 

Also referred to as a RITC, it is a contract to transfer the responsibility for discharging all the liabilities that attach to one year of account of a syndicate into a later year of account of the same or different syndicate in return for a premium. 

Retention 

The amount or portion of risk that an insurer retains for its own account. Losses in excess of the retention level are paid by the reinsurer. In proportional treaties, the retention may be a percentage of the original policy’s limit. In excess of loss business, the retention is a dollar amount of loss, a loss ratio or a percentage. 

Retrocedant 

A reinsurer who cedes all or a portion of its assumed insurance to another reinsurer. 

Retrocessional reinsurance; Retrocessionaire 

A transaction whereby a reinsurer cedes to another reinsurer, the retrocessionaire, all or part of the reinsurance that the first reinsurer has assumed. Retrocessional reinsurance does not legally discharge the ceding reinsurer from its liability with respect to its obligations to the reinsured. Reinsurance companies cede risks to retrocessionaires for reasons similar to those that cause primary insurers to purchase reinsurance: to reduce net liability on insurances, to protect against catastrophic losses, to stabilize financial ratios and to obtain additional underwriting capacity. 

Risks 

A term used to denote the physical units of property at risk or the object of insurance protection that are not perils or hazards. Also defined as chance of loss or uncertainty of loss. 

Risks attaching contracts 

Contracts that cover claims that arise on underlying insurance policies that incept during the term of the reinsurance contract. 

Solvency II 

A set of regulatory requirements that codify and harmonize the EU insurance and reinsurance regulation. Among other things, these requirements impact the amount of capital that EU insurance and reinsurance companies are required to hold. Solvency II came into effect on January 1, 2016. 

Specialty lines 

Lines of insurance and reinsurance that provide coverage for risks that are often unusual or difficult to place and do not fit the underwriting criteria of standard commercial products carriers. 

Statutory accounting principles 

Recording transactions and preparing financial statements in accordance with the rules and procedures prescribed or permitted by Bermuda, U.S. state insurance regulatory authorities including the NAIC and/or in accordance with Lloyd’s specific principles, all of which generally reflect a liquidating, rather than going concern, concept of accounting. 

Stop loss 

A form of reinsurance under which the reinsurer pays some or all of a cedant’s aggregate retained losses in excess of a predetermined dollar amount or in excess of a percentage of premium. 

Submission 

An unprocessed application for (i) insurance coverage forwarded to a primary insurer by a prospective policyholder or by a broker on behalf of such prospective policyholder, (ii) reinsurance coverage forwarded to a reinsurer by a prospective ceding insurer or by a broker or intermediary on behalf of such prospective ceding insurer or (iii) retrocessional coverage forwarded to a retrocessionaire by a prospective ceding reinsurer or by a broker or intermediary on behalf of such prospective ceding reinsurer.

Underwriting 

The insurer’s or reinsurer’s process of reviewing applications submitted for insurance coverage, deciding whether to accept all or part of the coverage requested and determining the applicable premiums. 

Underwriting capacity 

The maximum amount that an insurance company can underwrite. The limit is generally determined by a company’s retained earnings and investment capital. Reinsurance serves to increase a company’s underwriting capacity by reducing its exposure from particular risks. 

Underwriting expense ratio 

The ratio of the sum of the acquisition expenses and operational expenses to net premiums earned. 

Underwriting expenses 

The aggregate of policy acquisition costs, including commissions, and the portion of administrative, general and other expenses attributable to underwriting operations.
