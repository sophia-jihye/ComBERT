 ITEM 1. BUS INESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Tutor Perini Corporation, formerly known as Perini Corporation, was incorporated in 1918 as a successor to businesses which had been engaged in providing construction services since 1894. Tutor Perini Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (&#8220;Tutor Perini,&#8221; &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our,&#8221; unless the context indicates otherwise) is a leading construction company, based on revenue, as ranked by Engineering News-Record (&#8220;ENR&#8221;), offering diversified general contracting, construction management and design-build services to private customers and public agencies throughout the world. &#160; Our corporate headquarters are in Sylmar, California, and we have various other principal office locations throughout the United States and certain U.S. territories (see Item 2. Properties for a listing of our major facilities). Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#8220;TPC&#8221; . We are incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 

&#160; 

We and our predecessors have provided construction services since 1894 and have established a strong reputation within our markets by executing large, complex projects on time and within budget , while adhering to strict quality control measures. We offer general contracting, pre-construction planning and comprehensive project management services, including the planning and scheduling of the manpower, equipment, materials and subcontractors required for a project. We also offer self-performed construction services , including site work, concrete forming and placement, steel erection, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC). &#160; During 2015, we performed work on more tha n 1,500 construction projects. 

&#160; 

Our business is conducted through three basic segments: Civil, Building and Specialty Contractors, as described below in the &#8220;Business Segment Overview.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Historically, we have been recognized as one of the leading building contractors in the United States , as evidenced by our performance on several of the largest hospitality and gaming projects, including CityCenter and the Cosmopolitan Casino and Resort, and large transportation projects , such as the McCarran International Airport Terminal 3 in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2008, we embarked upon a strategy to better align our business to pursue markets with higher profit margins and the best long-term growth potential, while maintaining our presence as a leading contractor in the general building market. In September 2008, we completed a merger with Tutor-Saliba Corporation (&#8220;Tutor-Saliba&#8221;) to provide us with enhanced opportunities for growth not available to us on a stand-alone basis through increased size, scale, bonding capacity, immediate access to multiple geographic regions, management capabilities, complementary assets and expertise in large civil projects . The success of the Tutor-Saliba merger and the execution of the Company&#8217;s strategy to focus on captu ring higher-margin civil projects are best illustrated by the significant growth we have experienced in our Civil segment over the past five years . 

&#160; 

In 2010 and 2011, we took advantage of opportunities to expand our Company vertically and geographically through the strategic acquisitions of seven companies with demonstrated success in their respective markets. These acquisitions strengthened our geographic presence in our Building and Civil segments and also significantly increased our specialty contracting capabilities. In 2011, we completed an internal reorganization of our reporting segments with the creation of the Specialty Contractors segment, which we describe below. &#160; Furthermore, during 2014, we completed a reorganization , which resulted in the elimination of the Management Services segment. The Management Services segment formerly consisted of two subsidiary companies, Black Construction and Perini Management Services, which have since been included in the Civil and Building segments, respectively. 

&#160; 

We believe that the successful completion of our acquisition strategy has enabled us to realize cross-selling opportunities across an expanded geographic footprint, while continuing to focus on vertical integration through increased self-performed work capabilities, thus further improving profitability and providing greater stability during economic cycles. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Business Segment Overview 

&#160; 

Civil Segment 

&#160; 

Our Civil segment specializes in public works construction and the repair, replacement and reconstruction of infrastructure across most of the major geographic regions of the United States. Our civil contracting services include construction and rehabilitation of highways, bridges, mass-transit systems , and water management and wastewater treatment facilities. 

&#160; 

The Civil segment is comprised of the Company&#8217;s legacy heavy civil construction operations (civil operations of the former Perini Corporation and Tutor-Saliba, including Black Construction) and three companies acquired by the Company in 2011. Frontier-Kemper is a heavy civil contractor engaged in: 1) the constructing of tunnels for highways, railroads, subways and rapid transit systems, shafts and other facilities for wat er supply, wastewater transport and hydroelectric projects , and 2) the developing and equipping &#160; of mines with innovative hoisting, elevator and vertical conveyance systems. Lunda Construction is a heavy civil contractor engaged in the construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of bridges, railroads and other civil structures thro ughout the United States. Becho is engaged in drilling, foundation and excavation support for shoring, bridges, piers, roads and highway projects , primarily in the southwestern U nited S tates . We believe that the Company has benefitted through these acquisitions by allowing us to expand our geographic presence, enhance our civil construction capabilities and add experienced management with a proven, successful track record. 

&#160; 

Our Civil segment&#8217;s customers primarily award contracts through one of two methods: the traditional public &#8220;competitive bid&#8221; method, in which price is the major determining factor, or through a request for proposals where contracts are awarded based on a combination of technical capability and price. 

&#160; 

Traditionally, our Civil segment &#8217;s customers require each contractor to pre-qualify for construction business by meeting criteria that include technical capabilities and financial strength. Our financial strength and outstanding record of performance on challenging civil works projects often enable us to pre-qualify for projects in situations where smaller, less diversified contractors are unable to meet the qualification requirements. We believe this is a competitive advantage that makes us an attractive partner on the largest, most complex infrastructure projects and prestigious design-build, or DBOM (design-build-operate-maintain) contracts, which combine the nation&#8217;s top contractors with engineering firms, equipment manufacturers and project development consultants in a competitive bid selection process to execute highly sophisticated projects. 

&#160; 

In its 2015 rankings, ENR ranked us as the nation&#8217;s fourth largest domestic heavy contractor, fourth largest contractor in the transportation market and fourteenth largest contractor overall. 

&#160; 

We believe the Civil segment provides significant opportunities for growth due to the age and condition of existing infrastructure coupled with large government funding sources aimed at the replacement and repair of aging U.S. infrastructure and popular, often bipartisan, support from the public and elected officials for infrastructure improvement programs. Funding for major civil infrastructure projects is typically provided through a combination of one or more of the following: local, regional, state, and federal loans ; grants ; other direct allocations sourced through tax revenue ; bonds; and user fees. 

&#160; 

We have been active in civil construction since 1894 and believe we have a particular expertise in large, complex civil construction projects. We have completed or are currently working on some of the most significant civil construction projects in the United States. For example, we are currently working on various segments of the East Side Access project in New York City; the first segment of the California High-Speed Rail project; the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement (SR-99 bored tunnel) project in Seattle, Washington; the Third Street Light Rail - Central Subway project in San Francisco, California; the platform over the eastern rail yard and the Amtrak Tunnel at Hudson Yards in New York City; the rehabilitation of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in New York; the New Irvington Tunnel in Fremont, California; and the construction of express toll lanes along I-95 in Maryland. We have also performed runway widening and reconstruction projects at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York and the Caldecott Tunnel Fourth Bore project near Oakland, California . 

&#160; 

Building Segment 

&#160; 

Our Building segment has significant experience providing services to a number of specialized building markets for private and public works customers, including the hospitality and gaming, transportation, health care , corporate and municipal offices, sports and entertainment, education, correctional facilities, biotech, pharmaceutical, industrial and high-tech markets. We believe the success of the Building segment results from our proven ability to manage and perform large, complex projects with aggressive fast-track schedules, elaborate designs and advanced mechanical, electrical and life safety systems, while providing accurate budgeting and strict quality control. Although price is a key competitive factor, we believe our strong reputation, long-standing customer relationships and significant level of repeat and referral business have enabled us to achieve our leading position. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The Building segment is comprised of several operating units that provide general contracting, design-build, preconstruction and construction services in various regions of the United States. Tutor Perini Building Corp. focuses on large, complex building projects nationwide, including significant projects in the hospitality and gaming, commercial office, education, government facilities, and multi-unit residential markets. Rudolph and Sletten focuses on large, complex projects in California in the commercial office, technology, industrial, education, and government facilities markets. Roy Anderson Corp. (formerly known as Anderson Companies) provides its services, including disaster rapid response services, to public and private customers primarily throughout the southeastern United States. Perini Management Services provides diversified construction and design-build services to U.S. military and government agencies, as well as to surety companies and multi-national corporations in the United States and locations overseas. We believe that our national resources and strong r&#233;sum&#233; of notable projects will enable future growth on large, complex building projects. 

&#160; 

In its 2015 rankings, ENR ranked us as the tenth largest general building contractor in the United States. We are a recognized leader in the hospitality and gaming market, specializing in the construction of high-end resorts and casinos . We work with hotel operators, Native American tribal councils, developers and architectural firms to provide diversified construction services to meet the challenges of new construction and renovation of hotel and resort properties. We believe that our reputation for completing projects on time is a significant competitive advantage in this market, as any delay in project completion could result in significant loss of revenue for the customer. 

&#160; 

We have recently completed, or are currently working on, large private and public building projects across a wide array of building end markets , including commercial offices, multi-unit residential, health care , hospitality and gaming transportation, education, and entertainment . Specific projects include: a large office and research and development building in northern California for a confidential technology customer; the Panorama Tower in Miami, Florida; Tower C, Tower D and the Retail Gallery at Hudson Yards and the George Washington Bridge Bus Station redevelopment in New York City; the Washington Hospital expansion in Fremont, California; the Graton Rancheria Resort and Casino in Rohnert Park, California; the Chumash Casino Resort expansion in Santa Ynez, California; the Scarlet Pearl Casino Resort in D&#8217;Iberville, Mississippi; the Broadway Plaza retail development in Walnut Creek, California; Kaiser Hospital Buildings in San Leandro and Redwood City, California; and courthouses in San Bernardino and San Diego, California and Broward County, Florida. As a result of our reputation and track record, we were previously awarded and completed contracts for several marquee projects in the hospitality and gaming market, including the Resorts World New York Casino in Jamaica, New York, and CityCenter, The Cosmopolitan Resort and Casino, the Wynn Encore Hotel and Planet Hollywood , all in Las Vegas, Nevada. These projects span a wide array of building end markets and illustrate our Building segment&#8217;s r&#233;sum&#233; of successfully completed large-scale public and private projects . 

&#160; 

Specialty Contractors Segment 

&#160; 

Our Specialty Contractors segment specializes in electrical, mechanical, plumbing, HVAC, fire protection systems and pneumatically placed concrete for a full range of civil and building construction projects in the industrial, commercial, hospitality and gaming , and mass - transit end markets . This segment provides the Company with unique strengths and capabilities that position us as a full-service contractor with greater control over s cheduled work, project delivery and risk management. 

&#160; 

The Specialty Contractors segment is comprised of several operating units that provide unique services in various regions of the United States. Five Star Electric is one of the largest specialty contractors in New York City providing construction services in the electrical sector , including power, lighting, fire alarm, security, telecommunications, low voltage and wireless systems. Five Star Electric has established itself as an industry leader performing work in both the public and private sectors including high-end residential, hotel and commercial towers, transportation, water treatment plants, schools and universities, health care, retail, sports and government facilities. Fisk Electric covers many of the major commercial, transportation and industrial electrical construction markets in the southwestern and southeastern United States , with the ability to cover other attractive markets nationwide. Fisk&#8217;s expertise is in technology design and the development of electrical and technology systems for major projects spanning a broad variety of project types, including commercial office buildings, sports arenas, hospitals, research laboratories, hotels and casinos, convention centers, manufacturing plants, refineries and water and wastewater treatment facilities. WDF, Nagelbush and Desert Mechanical each provide mechanical, plumbing, HVAC and fire protection services to a range of customers in a wide variety of markets, including transportation, commercial/industrial, schools and universities and residential. WDF services the New York City metropolitan region, Nagelbush operates primarily in Florida and Desert Mechanical operates primarily in the western United States. Superior Gunite specializes in pneumatically placed structural concrete utilized in infrastructure projects nationwide, such as bridges, dams, tunnels and retaining walls . 

&#160; 

In its 2015 rankings, ENR ranked us as the fifth largest electrical contractor 1 , tenth largest mechanical contractor and seventh largest specialty contractor 1 in the United States. Through Five Star Electric and WDF collectively, we are also the largest specialty contractor in the New York City metropolitan area. 

&#160; 

1 &#160; This ranking represents the collective revenue of the Company&#8217;s specialty contracting subsidiaries as reported to ENR. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We have recently completed, or are currently working on , several electrical and mechanical projects at the World Trade Center and at Hudson Yards in New York City; two signal system modernization projects in New York City; and the new hospital at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. This segment has supported , or is currently supporting, several large projects in our Building and Civil segments, including the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement (SR-99 bored tunnel) project in Seattle, Washington; the McCarran International Airport Terminal 3 in Las Vegas, Nevada; the Resorts World New York Casino in Jamaica, New York; various segments of the Greenwich Street Corridor and East Side Access projects in New York City; the Caldecott Tunnel Fourth Bore project near Oakland, California; the New Irvington Tunnel in Fremont, California; and several marquee projects in the hospitality and gaming market, including CityCenter, The Cosmopolitan Resort and Casino and Planet Hollywood , all in Las Vegas, Nevada. 

&#160; 

The majority of work performed by our Specialty Contractors units is contracted directly with state and local municipal agencies, real estate developers, general contractors , commercial and industrial customers and school districts . A smaller , but growing , component of its work is performed as a subcontractor to the Company&#8217;s Building and Civil segments . 

&#160;

State and Local Government Agencies . Our state and local government customers include state transportation departments, metropolitan authorities, cities, municipal agencies, school districts and public universities. We provide services to our state and local customers primarily pursuant to contracts awarded through competitive bidding processes. Our building construction services for state and local government customers have included judicial and correctional facilities, schools and dormitories, health care facilities, convention centers, parking structures and other municipal buildings. Our civil contracting and building construction services are provided in locations throughout the country. 

&#160; 

Private Owners . Our private customers include real estate developers, health care companies, technology companies, hospitality and gaming resort owners, Native American sovereign nations, public corporations and private universities. We provide services to our private customers through negotiated contract arrangements, as well as through competitive bids. 

&#160; 

Federal Government Agencies . Our federal government customers include the U.S. State Department, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Air Force and the National Park Service. We provide services to federal agencies primarily pursuant to contracts for specific or multi-year assignments that involve new construction or infrastructure repairs or improvements. A portion of our revenue from federal agencies is derived from projects in overseas locations. We expect this to continue for the foreseeable future as a result of our experience and strong relationships with federal agencies, together with anticipated expenditures for defense, diplomatic and security-related construction work. 

&#160; 

Most federal, state and local government contracts contain provisions that permit the termination of contracts, in whole or in part, for the convenience of the government, among other reasons.

Backlog 

&#160; 

Backlog in our industry is a measure of the total value of work that is remaining to be performed on contracts awarded. We include a construction project in our backlog when a contract is awarded or a letter of commitment is obtained and we believe adequate funding is in place. As a result, we believe our backlog is firm, though cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Historically, we have not been negatively impacted by material cancellations or scope adjustments. Our backlog by segment and end market is as follows:

Types of Contracts 

&#160; 

The general contracting and management services we provide consist of planning and scheduling the manpower, equipment, materials and subcontractors required for the timely completion of a project in accordance with the terms, plans and specifications contained in a construction contract. We provide these services by entering into traditional general contracting arrangements, such as fixed price, guaranteed maximum price and cost plus fee contracts. These contract types and the risks generally inherent therein are discussed below: 

&#183; 

Fixed price or lump-sum contracts &#160; are most commonly used for projects in the C ivil and S pecialty Contractors segments and generally commit the Company to provide all of the resources required to complete a project for a fixed sum. Usually , &#160; fixed price contracts transfer more risk to the Company but offer the opportunity for greater profits. 

&#183; 

Guaranteed maximum price ( &#8220; GMP &#8221; ) contracts provide for a cost plus fee arrangement up to a maximum agreed upon price. These contracts place risks on the Company for amounts in excess of the GMP but may permit an opportunity for greater profits than under c ost p lus fee contracts through sharing agreements with the owner on any cost savings that may be realized. Services provided by our Building segment to various private customers are often performed under GMP contracts. 

&#183; 

U nit price contracts are most prevalent for projects in the C ivil and S pecialty Contractors segments and generally commit the Company to provide an undetermined number of units or components that comprise a project at a fixed price per unit. This approach shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required to the project owner , but the risk of increased cost per unit is borne by the Company unless otherwise allowed for in the contract. 

&#183; 

Cost plus fee contracts provide for reimbursement of project costs plus a stipulated fee . Cost p lus fee contracts include cost plus fixed fee contracts and cost plus award fee contracts. C ost plus fixed fee contracts provide for reimbursement of project costs plus a fixed fee.

Competition 

&#160; 

The markets in which we compete include numerous competitors. In the small to mid-size d work that we have targeted, we have continued to experience strong pricing competition from our competitors. However, much of the work that we target is for larger, more complex projects where there are fewer active market participants because of the enhanced capabilities and resources required to perform the work. As a result, on these larger projects we typically face fewer competitors . However, over the past year we have seen increased competition especially from foreign competitors that have been pursuing major projects in the United States due to the relatively larger size and number of U.S. opportunities . We anticipate that the increased level of foreign competition will persist for the foreseeable future . &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

In our Civil segment, we compete principally with large civil construction firms, including Dragados USA ; Flatiron Construction Corp. ; Fluor Corp. ; Granite Construction ; Kiewit Corp. ; Skanska USA ; Traylor Bros. , Inc. ; and The Walsh Group. In our Building segment, we compete with a variety of national and regional contractors. Our primary competitors are AECOM (through its acquisitions of Tishman Construction and Hunt Construction Group) ; Balfour Beatty Construction ; Clark Construction Group ; DPR Construction ; Gilbane, Inc. ; Hensel Phelps Construction Co. ; McCarthy Building Companies, Inc. ; Skanska USA ; Suffolk Construction; Turner Construction Co. ; The Walsh Group ; and The Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. In our Specialty Contractors segment, we compete principally with various regional and local electrical, mechanical and plumbing subcontractors. We believe price, experience, reputation, responsiveness, customer relationships, project completion track record, schedule control , risk management and quality of work are key factors customers consider when awarding contracts . 

&#160; 

Construction Costs 

&#160; 

I f prices for materials, labor or equipment increase excessively, provisions in certain types of contracts often shift all or a major portion of any adverse impact to the customer. In our fixed price contracts, we attempt to insulate ourselves from the unfavorable effects of inflation , &#160; when possible, by incorporating escalating wage and price as sumptions into our construction cost estimates , by obtaining firm fixed price quotes from major subcontractors and material suppliers , and by purchasing required materials early in the project schedule. Construction and other materials used in our construction activities are generally available locally from multiple sources and have been in adequate supply during recent years. Labor resources for our domestic projects are largely obtained through various labor unions with which we are associated. We have not experienced significant labor shortages in recent years, nor do we expect to in the future. We employ expatriate and local labor in selected overseas areas . 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

Our properties and operations are subject to federal, state and municipal laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including requirements for water discharges ; air emissions ; the use, management and disposal of solid or hazardous materials or wastes ; and the cleanup of contamination. In certain circumstances, we may also be required to hire subcontractors to dispose of hazardous materials encountered on a project in accordance with a plan approved in advance by the owner. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations , and we continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps to ensure compliance with those laws and regulations. &#160; H owever, future requirements or amendments to current laws or regulations imposing more stringent requirements could require us to incur additional costs to maintain or achieve compliance. 

&#160; 

In addition, some environmental laws, such as the U.S. federal &#8220;Superfund&#8221; law and similar state statutes, can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former owners or operators or upon parties who generated waste at, or sent waste to, these sites, regardless of who owned the site at the time of the release or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity. Contaminants have been detected at some of the sites that we own and where we worked as a contractor in the past, and we have incurred costs for the investigation and remediation of hazardous substances. We believe that our liability for these sites is not material , either individually or in the aggregate, and have pollution liability insurance available for such matters , and we receive indemnification from customers to cover the risks associated with environmental remediation. 

&#160; 

Insurance and Bonding 

&#160; 

All of our properties and equipment, as well as those of our joint ventures, are covered by insurance, in amounts that we believe are consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice. Our wholly owned subsidiary, PCR Insurance Company, issues deductible reimbursement policies for subcontractor default insurance, auto liability, general liability and workers&#8217; compensation insurance, allowing us to centralize our claims and risk management functions to reduce our insurance-related costs. 

&#160; 

As a normal part of the construction business, we are often required to provide various types of surety bonds as an additional level of security of our performance. We also require many of our higher-risk subcontractors to provide surety bonds as security for payment of subcontractors and suppliers and to guarantee their performance. As an alternative to traditional surety bonds, we also have purchased subcontractor default insurance for certain construction projects to insure against the risk of subcontractor default. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

The number of our employees varies based on the number of active projects, the type and magnitude of those projects, as well as our position within the lifecycle of those projects. Our total number of employees a s of &#160; December 31, 2015 was 10,626 . 

&#160; 

We are signatory to numerous local and regional collective bargaining agreements, both directly and through trade associations, as a union contractor. These agreements cover all necessary union crafts and are subject to various renewal dates. Estimated amounts for wage escalation related to the expiration of union contracts are included in our bids on various projects and, as a result, the expiration of any union contract in the next fiscal year is not expected to have any material impact on us. During the past several years, we have not experienced any significant work stoppages caused by our union employees.
