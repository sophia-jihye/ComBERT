 ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS 

&#160;

Overview

&#160;

We are principally engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products for human use in connection with a variety of high-incidence and high-mortality diseases and medical conditions in the People's Republic of China (the "PRC"). All of our operations are conducted in the PRC, where our manufacturing facilities are located. We manufacture pharmaceutical products in the form of dry powder injectables, liquid injectables, tablets, capsules, oral solutions and granules. All of our pharmaceutical products are sold on a prescription basis and have been approved for at least one or more therapeutic indications by the China Food and Drug Administration (the "CFDA") based upon demonstrated safety and efficacy.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we manufactured 20 pharmaceutical products for a wide variety of diseases and medical indications, each of which may be classified into one of three general categories:

&#160;

&#9679;

Basic generic drug, which is a common drug in the PRC for which there is a very large market demand;

&#160;

&#9679;

First-to-market generic drug, which is a generic Western drug that is new to the PRC marketplace; or

&#160;

&#9679;

Modern Traditional Chinese Medicine, which generally is a non-synthetic, plant-based medicinal compound of the type that has been widely used in the PRC for thousands of years, to which we apply modern production techniques to produce a pharmaceutical product in different formulations, such as tablets, capsules or powders.

&#160;

In selecting generic drugs to develop and manufacture, we consider several factors, including the number of other manufacturers currently producing the particular drug, the size of the market, the proposed or required method of distribution, the existing and expected pricing for the particular drug in the marketplace, the costs of manufacturing that drug, and the costs of acquiring or developing the formula for that drug. We believe we have historically selected generic drugs to manufacture that have large addressable markets and higher profit margins relative to other drugs being manufactured and distributed in the PRC.

&#160;

In 2002, we built, and we currently own and operate an approximately 8,000-square-meter manufacturing facility in Haikou, Hainan Province that supports eight modern, scalable production lines. We implement quality control procedures in compliance with China's Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP standards, and applicable CFDA regulations to ensure consistent quality in our products.

&#160;

The CFDA promulgated Good Manufacturing Practices for Pharmaceutical Products (2010 revised version) (the "new GMP") on February 12, 2011, which became effective on March 1, 2011. The new GMP standards outline the basic principles and standards for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products and the management of quality controls in the manufacturing process in the PRC. Pursuant to those mandatory requirements, the upgrading of our two injectables production lines was required to be accomplished by the end of 2013. From January 1, 2014 to November 3, 2014, we had suspended the production at our dry powder injectables and liquid injectables production lines due to the failure to meet new GMP upgrading deadline. In 2014, however, we completed construction of a 20,000 square-meter new factory installed with four sterilization production lines (two liquid injectables and two dry powder injectables production lines) to meet the latest GMP standard. In November 2014 the CFDA completed their process of the GMP certification for our new facility and issued a GMP certificate to enable us to commence manufacturing at our two liquid injectables and two dry powder injectables production lines. In January and December 2015, we also completed upgrading and received new GMP certificates for the tablet and capsule production lines and cephalosporin production lines in our old factories, respectively. The dry powder injectable and granule production lines in our old factory are expected to be upgraded in 2016.

&#160;

We market and sell our products through 16 sales offices covering all major cities and provinces in the PRC. To comply with applicable Chinese law relating to sales of prescription drugs to certain hospitals and clinics, we also use a distribution system comprised of over 1,000 independent prefecture-level, city-level, and county-level distributors. With the deepening of Chinese healthcare reform, our sales system has further developed and expanded. Our 16 provincial offices deliver our products to basic health care institutions as well as tier two and tier three hospitals through the above mentioned distributors.

&#160;

Corporate History

&#160;

We are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our production, marketing, finance, development and administrative activities through our wholly-owned subsidiary located in the PRC. We were incorporated in the state of Delaware under the name "Softstone, Inc." on January 28, 1999. From mid-2003 to October 19, 2005, we did not generate any significant revenue and we accumulated no significant assets as we explored business opportunities as a publicly-held "shell" corporation.

&#160;

We entered into our current line of business on October 19, 2005 by acquiring Onny Investment Limited, a holding company formed in the British Virgin Islands ("Onny"), and its operating subsidiary located in the PRC, Hainan Helpson Medical &#38; Biotechnology Co., Ltd. ("Helpson"). On March 16, 2006, we changed our corporate name to China Pharma Holdings, Inc. On December 31, 2012, we reincorporated from the State of Delaware to the State of Nevada.

&#160;

Helpson was established in Haikou, Hainan Province, PRC as a foreign-invested enterprise on February 25, 1993. The company was originally an "equity joint venture," as defined by China's laws on foreign invested enterprises, between Haikou Biomedical Engineering Co., Ltd., a PRC company, and Hong Kong Fudao Development Co., Ltd., a Hong Kong company ("Fudao").

&#160;

On June 16, 2001, Fudao entered into an Equity Interest Transfer Agreement with Hainan Kaidi Science and Technology Co., Ltd., a PRC company ("Kaidi"), pursuant to which Fudao transferred all of its ownership interest in Helpson to Kaidi. As a result of such transfer, Helpson became a PRC domestic company, rather than a foreign-invested company.

&#160;

Onny was incorporated on January 12, 2005 under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. On May 25, 2005, the then-existing three shareholders of Helpson entered into an equity interest transfer agreement with Onny, as a result of which, effective as of June 21, 2005, Helpson became a wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WFOE) and Onny became the sole stockholder of Helpson.

&#160;

On October 19, 2005, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Onny in exchange for 27,499,940 shares of our common stock and became Onny's sole stockholder. In connection with such share exchange, all of our officers and directors at that time resigned as officers and directors of our company, and new directors and executive officers were appointed. In addition, as a result of such share exchange, which is commonly referred to as a "reverse acquisition," Helpson became our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary.

&#160;

Our corporate organizational chart is set forth below.

Industry Background and Market Opportunities

The general sales growth of pharmaceutical industry has decreased mainly due to medical insurance cost control, drug prices control, the tenders being behind schedule and anti-commercial bribery, etc. Since 2014, the growth of sales for both western drugs and Traditional Chinese Medicines ("TCM") in all terminals has decreased along with the decrease in sales growth for hospitals and the final customers of distributors. Retail sales of western medicines and TCM was RMB696 billion in 2014, which represented a growth of 15% compared to the prior year; and the growth rate decreased by 2.7% YOY according to statistics issued by National Bureau of Statistics of PRC. However, the market demands of pharmaceutical industry continued to be supported by the increased government investment, universal medical insurance, aging population, two children policy, increased healthcare demand for chorionic diseases, and the increased spending on nutrition products.

In May 2015, the China State Council issued "State Council guidance on a comprehensive reform of urban public hospitals", which intends to reduce the percentage of medicine-spending-to-overall-spending to 30% from previously higher rate in the sample city public hospitals, and further creates heavy pressure upon the market size of pharmaceutical industry. Back in 2008, the " Hospital Management and Evaluation Guideline (2008 Version) " issued by the Ministry of Health (MOH) required Tier III hospitals to control this percentage within 45%. Turning to specific industrial data: the nation-wide pharmaceutical industry realized sales revenue of RMB2.33 trillion in 2014, up 12.9% compared to the prior year, while the growth rate decreased by 5% YOY; industry realized a total profit of RMB232 billion, up 12%, while the growth rate decreased by 6% YOY per National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS). The Company believes that this trend will continue. In the conference held in November of 2015, Southern Medicine Economic Institute promulgated by CFDA announced that China's pharmaceutical industry output growth was 11.7% in the first nine months of 2015 and further adjusted its forecast for 2015 annual pharmaceutical industry output growth from 15% to 12%. We also noticed that the macroeconomic growth in China keeps slowing down and the size of the pharmaceutical industry in China is under pressure due to governmental medicine spending control, restricted use of antibiotics, and price control.

It seems that the profitability, development capacity, and operating capacity of pharmaceutical industry have declined by various degrees in 2014 compared to the prior year.

Additionally, China's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry is currently dominated by small manufacture enterprises (SMEs), with relatively fragmented market share, and much lower level of concentration compared to developed countries. National Bureau of Statistics data shows that as of the end of 2014, there were 6,797 pharmaceutical manufacturers above state designated scale, with main business income of RMB2.46 trillion, while the total sales of global top 20 pharmaceutical companies reached USD9.37 trillion in 2014 per the data published by magazine Pharmaceutical Executive. The low industrial concentration led to inadequate investment in R&#38;D and production technology innovation. Generic drugs remained dominant (over 60% of market share), thus restricting the profitability of all players, including the Company. In the joint action of endogenous demand and external policy, enhancing the degree of industrial concentration has become a trend.

By the year 2014, there is a big space for improvement compared to China's pharmaceutical industry accounted for the proportion of the national economy and capital markets with the developed countries. China's health expenditure accounted for only 5.2% of GDP, while in the United States and Russia it was 17.9% and 6.2%, respectively.

Although some experts forecasted that Chinese pharmaceutical enterprises would usher in a "golden decade" along with China's economic growth, consumption upgrade, aging population, healthcare reform progress, and urbanization. The challenges remain due to low industrial concentration, small company size (only 34 pharmaceutical companies realized annual sales over RMB5 billion in 2014), unfulfilled financing leverage, industrial upgrading and M&#38;A demand.

National Medical Insurance Program . The National Medical Insurance Program (the "NMIP"), introduced in 1999, is the largest medical insurance program in the PRC. According to Notice on Urban Residents' Basic Medical Insurance Work in 2015 issued by Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of PRC and Ministry of Finance of PRC in January 2015, governments at all levels should increase the per capital health insurance subsidy by RMB60 compared to the basis in 2014, to RMB 380 per capita in 2015; and individual resident should increase its contribution by RMB60 compared to the basis in 2014, to no less than RMB 120 per capita in 2015; and increase the in-patient reimbursement rate to 75% in order to gradually narrow the gap between reimbursement and actual payment.

&#160;

&#160;

The NMIP is funded primarily by central and provincial governments and, to a lesser degree, by program participants and their employers. The program has two types of accounts: individual accounts and social pool accounts. Each participant has an individual account that holds all contributions from the participant and 30% of the contributions from his or her employer. The amounts of the employer's and the participant's contributions are determined as fixed percentages of the participant's salary. An increase in the participant's salary will increase the size of both contributions to the participant's individual account, subject to a fixed monthly cap that varies from city to city and may be adjusted from year to year. A participant may claim reimbursement from his or her individual account for prescription medicines, OTC medicines and other out-patient and in-patient medical expenses. The maximum amount available for reimbursement for an individual program participant is capped at a level equal to the balance in that individual's account. In addition to individual accounts, the NMIP in each province also includes a social pool account, which holds the contributions from the provincial government as well as the remaining 70% of employer contributions. The social medical expense pool is used to pay for hospitalization costs and in-patient related charges incurred by the participants, subject to certain co-payments, exclusions and limitations. Other than in the relatively more affluent eastern provinces in China, many provincial governments have not fully funded the provincial social medical expense pools, which results in delay or failure in reimbursing the hospitalization costs and other in-patient related expenses of the NMIP participants.

&#160;

The CFDA promulgated Good Manufacturing Practices for Pharmaceutical Products (2010 revised version) (the "new GMP") on February 12, 2011, which became effective on March 1, 2011. The new GMP standards outline the basic principles and standards for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products and the management of quality controls in the manufacturing process in the PRC. Since it was first enacted in 1988, GMP has over two decades of history in China, and went through two revisions in 1992 and 1998. As of June 30, 2004, manufacturing of all active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and finished dosage must be in compliance with the GMP standards. The new GMP standards that became effective on March 1, 2011 include improvements based upon foreign manufacturing advancements, and have taken into consideration local conditions in China. Based on the principle of "equal importance between hardware and software", strictly implementing the idea of risk control during the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, and more focus on scientific guidance and operability, the new GMP standards are consistent with the World Health Organization (WHO) standards.

&#160;

The four main characteristics of the new GMP standards are: (1) strengthening the establishment of the quality control system during the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products by significantly increasing the requirements on quality control software; (2) improving the requirements on the quality of practitioners; (3) refining operational procedures, rules on document management, including manufacturing records, improving guidance and operability; and (4) further improvements related to measures to ensure the safety of pharmaceutical products.

&#160;

Healthcare Reform . In September 2008, the PRC State Council published a draft plan to ease the difficulties and minimize the costs for Chinese citizens to obtain proper healthcare treatment. In April, 2015, the PRC State Council issued "Notice on Deepening Healthcare System Reform 2014 Summary and 2015 Key Tasks". The goal of the healthcare reform plan is to establish a basic, universal healthcare framework to provide safe, efficient, convenient and affordable healthcare to urban and rural residents.

Drug Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) model is the management model to separate marketing authorization and independent production license. The license holders may delegate the production to manufacturers and are only responsible for the safety, effectiveness and quality control of the drugs for the public. MAH model is a common practice worldwide for new drug review and approval, which encouraged investment in research &#38;development, and the adoption of Contract Manufacturing Organization (CMO).

In August 2015, the PRC State Council issued "Opinions on the Reform Drugs and Medical Devices Evaluation and Approval System Review"("Opinions"), which proposed to carry out the drug MAH system experiments. As the Company is considered a manufacturer, we believe this policy will benefit our company in the long run given our new GMP certified production facility because we have potential to manufacture products for those license holders in the future.

The essential idea of the "Opinions" is to improve drug quality, as well as the efficiency of new formula reviewing process. To be specific, the government is determined to clear up the CFDA new formula registration applications by the end of 2016; ensure all reviewing processes according to defined schedule by 2018; strive to complete the quality and efficacy consistency evaluation of national essential drugs for oral solutions and the reference formulation by the end of 2018; and improve the transparency of review and approval. The government intended to promote structural adjustment and upgrade the pharmaceutical industry through elevating the quality, safety and efficiency of pharmaceutical products to international standards. 

&#160;

&#160;

Our Strategy

&#160;

We believe we are well positioned in a comparatively steadily growing industry in one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. We currently manufacture a number of off-patent branded generic drugs that were among the first to market in the PRC. We expect to continue to gain additional competitive advantages through the growing pipeline of new pharmaceutical products we are developing for specific target patient groups. Our diverse portfolio of products and our new product pipelines include products for high-incidence and high-mortality conditions in China, such as cardiovascular, central nervous system (CNS), infectious and digestive diseases. Furthermore, the Healthcare Reform initiated by the State Council in 2008 in China has significantly expanded the landscape of healthcare industry in China. According to the 2015 National Economic and Social Development Statistics Bulletin People's Republic of China issued by National Bureau of Statistic of PRC, the total number of healthcare institutions has reached 990,248 as of the end of 2015, including 27,215 hospitals, 36,869 township healthcare centers, 34,588 community health service centers (stations), 195,866 clinics, 644,751 village healthcare centers, 3,492 disease prevention and control centers, 3097 institutes of health inspection. We believe the increase in demand from these sources should allow us to grow organically. In addition, medical personnel have reached 8.03 million, including 3 million practicing physicians and practicing assistant physicians, and 3.28 million registered nurses. Besides, number of beds in medical and health institutions have reached 7.08 million, including 5.34 million in hospitals, and 1.21 million in township healthcare centers.

The production approval from the CFDA on Candesartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist serving as a first-line treatment for hypertension in November 2013 which was launched to the market towards the end of 2014 and new products from our pipeline of products under development (such as the generic version of Crestor and novel anti-drug-resistant combination antibiotics) would offer us growth opportunities if these products are approved for manufacture and sale in the PRC. Finally, the Healthcare Reform has started to change the landscape of the Chinese pharmaceutical industry, which we believe will create many attractive acquisition opportunities. We plan to explore these opportunities in an effort to add synergistic products that can help us to grow.

&#160;

Our objective is to leverage our expertise in the PRC for the development, manufacture and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. We intend to achieve this objective by:

&#160;

&#9679;

Promoting Our Existing Brands to Increase Our National Recognition . We intend to support and grow the existing recognition and reputation of our brands and to maintain our branded pricing strategy through continued sales and marketing efforts, and our upgraded new GMP-compliant production lines. To achieve this goal, we plan to promote the efficacy and safety profile of our established prescription pharmaceutical products to physicians at hospitals and clinics in all provinces of PRC through the efforts of our sales force, independent distributors and educational physician conferences and seminars.

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679;

Developing and Introducing Additional Products to Expand or Strengthen Our Existing Product Portfolio . We plan to focus our development capabilities towards expanding our existing portfolio of approved products. We have a number of products in various stages of the CFDA approval process. In addition, we intend to conduct clinical trials for new generic or modernized products to expand our current existing products. We plan to introduce new generic or modernized products to leverage our branded market leadership position, particularly in the therapeutic areas in which we already have a strong presence.

&#160;

&#9679;

Expanding Our Distribution Network For Further Market Penetration . We intend to expand our reach beyond our current 16 offices in the PRC to drive additional growth of our existing and future products. We currently contract with over 1,000 distributors in the PRC and plan to expand upon these relationships to target new markets. We will continue our prudent sales strategy to tighten the cooperation with customers with good accounts receivable collection performance. In addition, we plan to continue to broaden our marketing efforts outside of major cities in the PRC and increase our market penetration in cities and rural areas in which we already have a presence. Over the long term, we also intend to expand our presence beyond the PRC to international markets by working with international pharmaceutical companies in cross selling our products.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679;

Acquiring Complementary Products Lines, Technologies, Distribution Networks and Companies . We intend to selectively pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that we believe will grow our customer base, expand our product lines and distribution network, enhance our manufacturing and technical expertise or otherwise complement our business or further our strategic goals. Pursuing strategic acquisitions is a significant component of our growth strategy. The Company has not identified any strategic acquisition opportunities as of the date of this report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

Due to the nature of the pharmaceutical industry, we continually strive to change our product portfolio to respond to changes in market demand. Based on the foundation established by a number of our widely-recognized prescription products, such as Cefaclor and Roxithromycin, we have launched and will continue to launch a variety of medicines. The core criteria for our selection of potential pipeline products are strong market demand, as well as proven efficacy and safety. In an effort to gain an advantage in the marketplace, we often seek to improve the production process of the new generic products we elect to manufacture or to strengthen the quality of a proposed product to increase its efficacy.

We also adjust the delivery system and marketing for each of our products based on the product's target patient group. We believe that maintaining a variety of delivery systems (e.g. tablet, capsule, granule, injectables and dry powder) for certain of our products targeted at different groups enhances our competitive position in the marketplace. As a result, our sales and marketing personnel work closely with management and our research and development personnel to determine which of our products can successfully be marketed in more than one delivery system and which generics in the marketplace may be a good candidate for us to manufacture and distribute in the marketplace using a different delivery system.

Product Development

Our product portfolio includes both branded and generic drugs that we either develop independently or with joint research efforts with our academic institutional partners or, to a lesser extent, acquire from third parties. We develop new products in-house as well as through cooperation with several research institutes, including the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China University of Pharmaceuticals, Sichuan University, Chongqing Medical Industry Institute and the Military Medical Academy Basic Medical Science Institute. We only pay these institutes for their research efforts and expenses if the research goals are accomplished evidenced by the certification of an applicable drug candidate and approval of drug production by the CFDA. Following our receipt of such certification and approval, the rights to the applicable drug candidate are transferred to us. Following any such payment and transfer, we become the sole owner of the drug certifications and/or the approvals of drug production, and any related research. We have no further payment or other obligations to the research institute from which we acquired such assets. In this manner, we obtained certificates and approvals of drug production for our Naproxen Sodium and PseudophedrineHydroclorida sustained release tablets through our cooperative relationship with the Chongqing Medical Industry Institute; we also obtained certificates and approvals of drug production for our Cefalcor dispersible tablets through our cooperative relationship with the China University of Pharmaceuticals. We are now manufacturing and selling both drugs. We expect to continue to develop additional new drugs under this method. We also intend to continue purchasing or obtaining licenses from third parties to produce certain drug products on a limited basis, as we regard this as an important and effective means for us to develop our business. The new products in our pipeline have experienced delays. The CFDA enhanced its approval criteria and processes, resulting in additional supplemental materials and trials, higher cost, and longer approval time for certain applications across all pharmaceutical products including all of our product types. We commenced leading formulation screening, a new technology exploration and technical criteria improvement activity in 2013. We expect this new model will accelerate our development timelines and expand our exploration channels for our pipeline products.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Generic drugs refer to the drugs with the same active ingredient, dosage form, delivery channel and therapeutic effects compared to the original drugs. "Consistency Evaluation" requires currently marketed generic products to prove consistency in term of quality and therapeutic effect, and substitutable during clinical trials with original drug. The Consistency Evaluation could enhance the development of pharmaceutical industry, ensure drug safety and effectiveness, promote the upgrading and restructuring of the pharmaceutical industry, and improve international competitiveness.

The PRC State Council issued the "Opinions on Carrying out Consistency Evaluation on Quality and Efficacy of Generic Drugs " ( the "Opinions") on March 5, 2016, which requires all chemical generic pipeline products to carry out Consistency Evaluation before final registration approval. In addition, all oral solution generic drugs listed in National Essential Drugs List (2012 edition) and launched into the market before October 1, 2007 should complete Consistency Evaluation by the end of 2018; Consistency Evaluation should be completed by the end of 2021 for drugs with existing special conditions or those which require clinical efficacy trials. Drugs failing to meet requirements shall not be re-registered. As of today, at least three of our products in pipe lines were postponed in receiving their CFDA approval due to this additional new requirement and the Company will strive to accelerate the process.

As of December 31, 2015, the product candidates that we are developing at different stages include the following:

&#160;

We have several other pipeline products in various stages of development.

Our drug formula development and acquisition expenditures were approximately $1.0 million and $2.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which represented 4.7% and 12.6% of our revenues for such years, respectively.

&#160;

&#160; Distribution and Customers 

&#160;

We believe we have a well-developed sales network. As our current pharmaceutical product portfolio is comprised mainly prescription drugs, our major sales targets are hospitals. As of December 31, 2015, we also had 16 sales offices covering all major provinces of China, and over 1,000 sales representatives who assist in managing many of our relationships with hospitals, doctors and local drug distributors. Overall, our distribution model is rather flat, with relatively few intermediaries compared to many other pharmaceutical companies in China . Due to this advantage, we believe we are able to keep our selling cost lower than the industry average.

&#160;

Due to the nature of our products and current governmental regulations, all of our customers are located in the PRC. We have established long-standing relationships with most of our key customers as our operating subsidiary, Helpson, formed in 1993.

&#160;

Production Facilities

&#160;

We manufacture and package our products at our manufacturing facility in the Haikou Free Trade Zone in Haikou, Hainan Province. Our manufacturing facility, which was built in 2002, is approximately 8,000 square meters and has eight production lines for different forms including: tablets, capsule, granule, dry power, liquid injectables, Cephalosporins (specifically designated), chemical API, and biological API.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The CFDA promulgated Good Manufacturing Practices for Pharmaceutical Products (2010 revised version) (the "New GMP Standards") on February 12, 2011, which became effective on March 1, 2011. The new GMP outlines the basic principles and standards for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products and the management of quality controls in the manufacturing process in the PRC. Pursuant to those mandatory requirements, the upgrading of our two sterilization production lines - liquid injectables and dry powder injectables production lines were required to be completed by the end of 2013. As of January 1, 2014, we had suspended such two production lines due to the failure to meet the GMP upgrading deadline. However, construction of our new main building has been completed, and two new sterilization production lines have been installed. In November 2014 the CFDA completed their process of the GMP certification for our new facility and issued the GMP certificate to enable us to commence manufacturing our liquid injectables and dry powder injectable product lines. In January and December 2015, we also completed the upgrading and received new GMP certificates for the tablet and capsule production lines, and cephalosporin production lines in our old factories respectively. The dry powder injectable and granule production lines in our old factory is expected to be upgraded in 2016.

&#160;

Raw Materials

&#160;

We require a supply of a wide variety of raw materials to manufacture our products. We employ purchasing staff with extensive knowledge of our products who work with our product development, and formulations and quality control personnel to source raw materials for our products. Currently, we rely on numerous suppliers in the PRC and overseas to deliver our required raw materials and believe we have at least three principal suppliers for each of our most critical raw materials. Historically, we have not had difficulty obtaining raw materials from suppliers. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our purchases from one supplier accounted for approximately 27% of raw material purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2014, purchases from one supplier accounted for approximately 26.5% of raw material purchases.

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

We believe we have established a commercially competitive position in the highly-fragmented pharmaceutical industry in China through our core competitive advantages, as described below:

&#160;

We have a highly-efficient commercialization process for new products, including significant experience with the CFDA registration process.

&#160;

We have over 20 years of product-development experience during which time we have implemented processes to efficiently introduce and market new and existing products to the Chinese market. We have successfully obtained the final production approval from the CFDA for many pharmaceutical products, including fifteen new products in the past ten years.

We have a market-oriented product portfolio and product lines.

&#160;

Our product focus is on developing and manufacturing medicines that help large patient groups, such as the infectious disease and cardio vascular disease patient groups. Our diversified GMP-certified manufacturing facility includes eight production lines targeting a variety of delivery mechanisms, such as tablets, capsules, cephalosprine tablets, cephalosprine capsules, liquid-injectables and dry powder injectables, which enables us to effectively manufacture a broad range of new drugs. We also have another two production lines, namely, the granule and dried power injectable production lines, yet to which we anticipate will be upgraded during 2016 in order to meet the New GMP Standards.

&#160;

We have product diversification to target specific sub-markets.

&#160;

We attempt to differentiate our products from those of our competitors by changing, and, in many cases, improving, certain physical aspects of our products to address to different market segments. For example, to make our Cefaclor product more patient friendly to children and patients with swallowing problems, we added an enteric coating to make our tablets easier to swallow.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We have a national sales network and a highly-trained marketing team.

&#160;

Our experienced sales team has the industry knowledge and know-how to synergistically combine our strong market insight with a successful commercialization platform.

&#160;

We have developed high-quality relationships with leading hospital and clinic administrators and physicians.

&#160;

While sales of our pharmaceutical products to hospitals are made through our distributors, we believe our long-term relationships with leading hospitals and healthcare clinics throughout China resulting from our long-term promotional efforts and periodic physician seminars improve the perception of our products in the marketplace and help us identify and select high-volume drugs to develop into new generic products relatively early in the process.

&#160;

We cooperate effectively with a number of leading academic research institutions.

&#160;

Through our cooperative efforts with leading academic research institutions, which are our research partners, we are able to develop new product candidates in a cost-effective manner and currently have a number of significant projects in active development in our pipeline.

&#160;

Notwithstanding such favorable positioning, we are subject to intense competition. There are both local and overseas pharmaceutical enterprises that are engaged in the manufacture and sale of potential substitute or similar pharmaceutical products in the PRC. These competitors may have more capital and better research and development resources, and manufacturing and marketing capability and experience than we do.

&#160;

Our profitability may be adversely affected if

&#160;

&#9679; the number of our competitors increases;

&#160;

&#9679; competitors engage in increased price competition; or

&#160;

&#9679; competitors develop new products or product substitutes having comparable medicinal applications or therapeutic effects that are more effective, less costly and/or have more perceived benefits than those produced by us. 

&#160;

In addition, competition from imported products and China's admission as a member of the World Trade Organization ("WTO") creates increased competition. The PRC became a member of the WTO in December 2001. As a result of the admission into the WTO, competition in the pharmaceutical industry in the PRC intensified generally in two respects. With lower import tariffs, imported pharmaceutical products manufactured overseas may become increasingly competitive in terms of pricing. We also believe that well-established foreign pharmaceutical manufacturers may set up production facilities in the PRC and compete with domestic manufacturers directly. With the expected increased supply of competitively-priced pharmaceutical products in the PRC, we may face increased competition from foreign pharmaceutical products, especially in terms of high-end pharmaceutical products, including certain types of products manufactured by U.S. manufacturers.

&#160;

Intellectual Property

&#160;

We regard our packaging designs, trademarks, trade secrets, patent and similar intellectual property as part of our core competence that is critical to our success. We rely on patent, trademark and trade secret law, as well as confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees, distributors and others to protect our intellectual property rights.

&#160;

In November 2008, we purchased the patented medical formula for a cerebral/cardio-vascular indication and the manufacturing processes for that product candidate from a third party laboratory. In connection with that acquisition, we obtained the title of the patent. This patent expires in 2025.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In 2012, we acquired another patent related to a medical formula for the treatment of cerebral/cardio-vascular diseases. This patent expires in 2029.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we owned 17 registered trademarks in the PRC, including marks for nine of the 20 pharmaceutical products we manufacture, including the tradenames Funalin, Fukexing, Beisha, Shiduotai, Xinuo, Pusenlitai, Pusenouke, Shuchang and Shenkaineng, as well as marks for our AFGF logo, our HPS logo, our two HELPSON logos and four other logos. The registration numbers of the 17 registered trademarks are as follows: No.1280259, No.1500459, No.1511770, No.1535416, No.1537828, No.1535420, No.1272792, No.1272759, No.1272760, No.1330294, No.1327731, No.1330295, No.1476339, No.3993785, No. 4074317, No.4074321 and No. 4315247.

&#160;

Environmental Matters

&#160;

We comply with the Environmental Protection Law of China as well as applicable local regulations. In addition to statutory and regulatory compliance, we actively ensure the environmental sustainability of our operations. Penalties may be levied upon us if we fail to adhere to and maintain certain standards. Such failure has not occurred in the past, and we generally do not anticipate that it will occur in the future, but no assurance can be given in this regard.

&#160;

Regulations

&#160;

Regulations Relating to Pharmaceutical Industry . The pharmaceutical industry in China is highly regulated. The primary regulatory authority is the CFDA, including its provincial and local branches. As a developer and producer of medicinal products, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the CFDA and its provincial and local branches. The Law of the PRC on the Administration of Pharmaceuticals provides the basic legal framework for the administration of the production and sale of pharmaceuticals in China and covers the manufacturing, distribution, packaging, pricing and advertising of pharmaceutical products. These regulations set forth detailed rules with respect to the administration of pharmaceuticals in China. We are also subject to other PRC laws and regulations that are applicable to business operators, manufacturers and distributors in general. 

Registration and Approval of Medicine . Pursuant to the PRC Provisions for Drug Registration, a medicine must be registered and approved by the CFDA before it can be manufactured and sold. The registration and approval process requires the manufacturer to submit to the CFDA a registration application containing detailed information concerning the efficacy and quality of the medicine and the manufacturing process and the production facilities the manufacturer expects to use. This process generally takes two to five years and could be longer, depending on the nature of the medicine under review, the quality of the data provided and the workload of the CFDA. If a manufacturer chooses to manufacture a pre-clinical medicine, it is also required to conduct pre-clinical trials, apply to the CFDA for permission to conduct clinical trials and go through the clinical trials. If a manufacturer chooses to manufacture a post-clinical medicine, it only needs to go through the clinical trials. In both cases, a manufacturer needs to file clinical data with the CFDA for approval for manufacturing after clinical trials are completed.

&#160;

New Medicine . If a medicine is approved by the CFDA as a new medicine, the CFDA will issue a new medicine certificate to the manufacturer and impose a monitoring period of one to five years. During the monitoring period, the CFDA will monitor the safety of the new medicine, and will neither accept new medicine certificate applications for an identical medicine by another pharmaceutical company, nor approve the production or import of an identical medicine by other pharmaceutical companies. As a result of these regulations, the holder of a new medicine certificate has the exclusive right to manufacture the new medicine during the monitoring period. We currently have new medicine certificates for our Pusenouke, Cefaclor dispersible tablets and Roxithromycin dispersible tablets and Bumetanide for injection products.

&#160;

National Production Standard and Provisional Standard . In connection with the CFDA's approval of a new medicine, the CFDA will normally direct the manufacturer to produce the medicine according to a provisional national production standard, or a provisional standard. A provisional standard is valid for two years, during which time the CFDA closely monitors the production process and quality consistency of the medicine to develop a national final production standard for the medicine, or a final standard. Three months before the expiration of the two-year period, the manufacturer is required to apply to the CFDA to convert the provisional standard to a final standard. Upon approval, the CFDA will publish the final standard for the production of this medicine. There is no statutory timeline for the CFDA to complete its review and grant approval for the conversion. In practice, the approval for conversion to a final standard is time-consuming and could take a number of years. However, during the CFDA's review period, the manufacturer may continue to produce the medicine according to the provisional standard.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Transitional Period . Prior to the latter of (1) the expiration of a new medicine's monitoring period or (2) the date when the CFDA grants a final standard for a new medicine after the expiration of the provisional standard, the CFDA will not accept applications for an identical medicine nor will it approve the production of an identical medicine by other pharmaceutical companies. Accordingly, the manufacturer will continue to have an exclusive production right for the new medicine during this transitional period.

Continuing CFDA Regulation

&#160;

Pharmaceutical manufacturers in China are subject to continuing regulation by the CFDA. If the labeling or its manufacturing process of an approved medicine is significantly modified, a new pre-market approval or pre-market approval supplement will be required by the CFDA. A pharmaceutical manufacturer is subject to periodic inspection and safety monitoring by the CFDA to determine compliance with regulatory requirements.

&#160;

The CFDA has a variety of enforcement actions available to enforce its regulations and rules, including fines and injunctions, recall or seizure of products, the imposition of operating restrictions, partial suspension or complete shutdown of production and criminal prosecution.

&#160;

Pharmaceutical Product Manufacturing

&#160;

Permits and Licenses for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers . A pharmaceutical manufacturer must obtain a pharmaceutical manufacturing permit from the CFDA's relevant provincial branch. This permit is valid for five years and is renewable for an additional five-year period upon its expiration. Our current pharmaceutical manufacturing permit, issued by the CFDA, will expire on December 31, 2016.

&#160;

Good Manufacturing Practice. A pharmaceutical manufacturer must meet the Good Manufacturing Practice standards, or GMP standards, for each of its production facilities in China in respect of each form of pharmaceutical product it produces. GMP standards include staff qualifications, production premises and facilities, equipment, raw materials, environmental hygiene, production management, quality control and customer complaint administration. If a manufacturer meets the GMP standards, the CFDA will issue to the manufacturer a Good Manufacturing Practice certificate, or a GMP certificate, with a five-year validity period. However, for a newly-established pharmaceutical manufacturer that meets the GMP standards, the CFDA will issue a GMP certificate with only a one-year validity period. The New GMP Standards became effective on March 1, 2011 and pharmaceutical manufacturers (except manufacturers of injectables, blood products or vaccines, which have a three-year grace period) have a five-year grace period to upgrade existing facilities to comply with the revisions.

&#160;

We obtained three GMP certificates for our manufacturing facility in respect of the majority form of pharmaceutical product we produce, one valid until October 30, 2019 (lyophilized powder for injection, small volume parenteral solutions), one valid until January 2020 (tablets, capsules), and one valid until December 6, 2020 (tables, capsule - cephalosprins). All of our GMP certificates are valid for five years. While we are required to implement certain upgrades to our manufacturing facilities to comply with the new GMP standards, we do not currently anticipate any difficulty in renewing these certificates when we finish the facility upgrading.

&#160;

Product Liability and Consumers Protection

&#160;

Product liability claims may arise if any pharmaceutical products sold have a harmful effect on the consumers, and the injured party may claim for damages or compensation. The General Principles of the Civil Law of the PRC, which became effective in January 1987, state that manufacturers and sellers of defective products causing property damage or injury shall incur civil liabilities for such damage or injuries.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Product Quality Law of the PRC was enacted in 1993 and amended in 2000 to strengthen the quality control of products and protect consumers' rights and interests. Under this law, manufacturers and distributors who produce or sell defective products may be subject to confiscation of earnings from such sales, revocation of business licenses and imposition of fines, and in severe circumstances, may be subject to criminal liability.

&#160;

The Law of the PRC on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Consumers was promulgated on October 31, 1993 and became effective on January 1, 1994 to protect consumers when they purchase or use goods or services. All business operators must comply with this law when they manufacture or sell goods and/or provide services to customers. In extreme situations, pharmaceutical product manufacturers and distributors may be subject to criminal liability if their goods or services lead to the death or injuries of customers or other third parties.

&#160;

Price Controls

&#160;

The retail prices of some pharmaceutical products sold in China, primarily those included in the Essential Drug and Reimbursement Lists and those pharmaceutical products for which production or distribution are deemed to constitute monopolies, are subject to price controls in the form of retail price ceilings. In particular, manufacturers or distributors cannot freely set or change the retail price for any price-controlled product above the applicable price ceiling or deviate from the applicable fixed price imposed by the PRC government. The prices of medicines that are not subject to price controls are determined freely at the discretion of the respective pharmaceutical companies, subject to notification to the provincial pricing authorities. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) may grant premium pricing status to certain pharmaceutical products that are subject to price controls, and may set the price-ceiling for pharmaceutical products that have obtained such status.

&#160;

However, per the "Notice on Advancing Drug Price Reform " issued by National Development and Reform Commission of PRC, except for narcotic drugs and the first class psychoactive drugs, the prices originally set by the government should be disregarded after June 1st, 2016.

The essential ideas of NDRC upon drugs price reform include elimination of government pricing, medical insurance cost-control, and bidding procedure. It believes that actual transaction price of drugs should be formed through market competition.

However, eliminating only one controlling factor does not bring immediate transfer into pure marketization. There is no real change upon centralized drug bidding system which has more decisive impact on pricing. In this regard, this movement of NDRC might not cause any significant trend upon price.

Reimbursement under the National Medical Insurance Program

&#160;

Per Social Security Center of the Ministry of Social Security of China, over 1.3 billion people had been enrolled into the National Medical Insurance Program (NMIP) by the end of 2014, which include 0.28 billion from the Employee Medical Insurance Program, 0.29 billion from the Urban Residence Medical Insurance Program, and 0.81 billion from the New Rural Medical Insurance Program.. The Ministry of Labor and Social Security, together with other government authorities, determines which medicines are to be included in or removed from the national medicine catalog for the NMIP, and under which tier a medicine should fall, both of which affect the amounts reimbursable to program participants for their purchases of those medicines. These determinations are based on a number of factors, including price and efficacy. A NMIP participant can be reimbursed for the full cost of a Tier 1 medicine and 80-90% of the cost of a Tier 2 medicine.

&#160;

Although it is designated as a national program, the implementation of the NMIP is delegated to various provincial governments, each of which has established its own medicine catalog. A provincial government must include all Tier 1 medicines listed in the national medicine catalog in its provincial medicine catalog, but may use its discretion based on its own selection criteria to add other medicines to, or exclude Tier 2 medicines listed in the national medicine catalog from its provincial medicine catalog, so long as the combined numbers of the medicines added and excluded do not exceed 15% of the number of the Tier 2 medicines listed in the national catalog. In addition, provincial governments may use their discretion to upgrade a nationally classified Tier 2 medicine to Tier 1 in their provincial medicine catalogs, but may not downgrade a nationally classified Tier 1 medicine to Tier 2.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The total amount of reimbursement for the cost of prescription and OTC medicines, in addition to other medical expenses, for an individual program participant in a calendar year is capped at the amount in that participant's individual account. The amount in a participant's account varies, depending upon the amount of contributions from the participant and his or her employer. Generally, on average, program participants who are from relatively wealthier eastern parts of China and relatively wealthier metropolitan centers have greater amounts in their individual accounts than those from less developed provinces.

&#160;

Currently, all of our pharmaceutical products are listed on the National Insurance Catalogue (NIC), and four of our products -Vitamin B6, Cefalexin, Clarithromycin and Omeprazole - are listed on the Essential Drug List (EDL). However, some of our non-EDL drugs have been selected to enter the provincial EDL, which varies from province to province. We believe these drugs will experience an increase in sales volume due to the government-initiated promotion of those drugs, while remaining free from the pricing pressures often experienced by drugs listed on the EDL.

&#160;

Other Regulations

&#160;

In addition to the regulations relating to pharmaceutical industry in China, we are also subject to the regulations applicable to a foreign invested enterprise in China.

&#160;

Foreign Currency Exchange. Pursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration Rules promulgated in 1996 and amended in 1997 and various regulations issued by State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or the SAFE, and other relevant PRC government authorities, Renminbi is freely convertible only to the extent of current account items, such as trade-related receipts and payments, interests and dividends. Capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investment, require the prior approval from the SAFE or its local counterpart for conversion of Renminbi into a foreign currency, such as U.S. dollars, and remittance of the foreign currency outside the PRC.

&#160;

Payments for transactions that take place within the PRC must be made in Renminbi. Unless otherwise approved, PRC companies other than foreign investment enterprises (FIEs) must convert foreign currency payments they receive from abroad into Renminbi. On the other hand, FIEs may retain foreign exchange in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks, subject to a cap set by the SAFE or its local counterpart.

&#160;

Dividend Distribution. Under the PRC regulations governing dividend distributions by wholly foreign-owned enterprises and Sino-foreign equity joint ventures, wholly foreign-owned enterprises and Sino-foreign equity joint ventures in the PRC may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Additionally, these foreign-invested enterprises are required to set aside certain amounts of their accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had 415 employees, among which 373 employees were full-time employees and 42 employees were temporary employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union and, in general, we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

&#160;

As required by applicable Chinese law, we have entered into employment contracts with substantially all of our officers, managers and employees. We are working towards entering into employment contracts with those employees who do not currently have employment contracts with us. The PRC enacted a new Labor Contract Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008. We have updated our employment contracts and employee handbook and are in compliance with such law.

&#160;
