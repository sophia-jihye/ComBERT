 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Insteel Industries, Inc. (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;the Company&#8221; or &#8220;Insteel&#8221;) is the nation&#8217;s largest manufacturer of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications. We manufacture and market prestressed concrete strand (&#8220;PC strand&#8221;) and welded wire reinforcement (&#8220;WWR&#8221;), including ESM, concrete pipe reinforcement (&#8220;CPR&#8221;) and standard welded wire reinforcement (&#8220;SWWR&#8221;). Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products that are used in nonresidential construction. For fiscal 2016, we estimate that approximately 85% of our sales were related to nonresidential construction and 15% were related to residential construction. 

&#160; 

Insteel is the parent holding company for two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Insteel Wire Products Company (&#8220;IWP&#8221;), an operating subsidiary, and Intercontinental Metals Corporation, an inactive subsidiary. We were incorporated in 1958 in the State of North Carolina. 

&#160; 

Our business strategy is focused on: (1) achieving leadership positions in our markets; (2) operating as the lowest cost producer; and (3) pursuing growth opportunities in our core businesses that further our penetration of the markets we currently serve or expand our footprint. Headquartered in Mount Airy, North Carolina, we operate ten manufacturing facilities that are all located in the U.S. in close proximity to our customers and raw material suppliers. Our growth strategy is focused on organic opportunities as well as acquisitions in existing or related markets that leverage our infrastructure and core competencies in the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products. 

&#160; 

On August 15, 2014, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IWP, purchased substantially all of the assets associated with the PC strand business of American Spring Wire Corporation (&#8220;ASW&#8221;) for a final adjusted purchase price of $33.5 million (the &#8220;ASW Acquisition&#8221;). ASW manufactured PC strand at facilities located in Houston, Texas and Newnan, Georgia (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). We acquired, among other assets, the accounts receivable and inventories related to ASW&#8217;s PC strand business, production equipment at its facilities in Houston, Texas and Newnan, Georgia, and the Newnan facility. We also entered into an agreement with ASW to lease the Houston facility with an option to purchase it in the future. Subsequent to the acquisition, we elected to consolidate our PC strand operations with the closure of the Newnan facility, which was completed in March 2015. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

Our operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications. Our concrete reinforcing products consist of two product lines: PC strand and WWR. Based on the criteria specified in Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 280, Segment Reporting, we have one reportable segment. 

&#160; 

PC strand is a high strength, seven-wire strand that is used to impart compression forces into precast concrete elements and structures, which may be either pretensioned or posttensioned, providing reinforcement for bridges, parking decks, buildings and other concrete structures. Its high tensile strength allows for the casting of longer spans and thinner sections. Pretensioned or &#8220;prestressed&#8221; concrete elements or structures are primarily used in nonresidential construction while posttensioned concrete elements or structures are used in both nonresidential and residential construction. For fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, PC strand sales represented 39%, 43% and 38%, respectively, of our net sales. 

&#160; 

WWR is produced as either a standard or a specially engineered reinforcing product for use in nonresidential and residential construction. We produce a full range of WWR products, including ESM, CPR and SWWR. ESM is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement for concrete elements or structures, frequently serving as a lower cost reinforcing solution than hot-rolled rebar. CPR is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement in concrete pipe, box culverts and precast manholes for drainage and sewage systems, water treatment facilities and other related applications. SWWR is a secondary reinforcing product that is produced in standard styles for crack control applications in residential and light nonresidential construction, including driveways, sidewalks and various slab-on-grade applications. For fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, WWR sales represented 61%, 57% and 62%, respectively, of our net sales. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

We market our products through sales representatives who are our employees. Our outside sales representatives are trained on the technical applications for our products and sell multiple product lines in their respective territories. We sell our products nationwide across the U.S. and, to a much lesser extent, into Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America, delivering them primarily by truck, using common or contract carriers. The delivery method selected is dependent upon backhaul opportunities, comparative costs and customer service requirements. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

We sell our products to a broad range of customers that includes manufacturers of concrete products, and to a lesser extent, distributors, rebar fabricators and contractors. In fiscal 2016, we estimate that approximately 70% of our net sales were to manufacturers of concrete products and 30% were to distributors, rebar fabricators and contractors. In many cases we are unable to identify the specific end use for our products as most of our customers sell products that are used for both nonresidential and residential construction, and the same products can be used for different end uses. We did not have any customers that represented 10% or more of our net sales in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, and are not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

Backlog &#160; 

&#160; 

Backlog for our business is minimal due to the relatively short lead times that are required by our customers. We believe that the majority of our firm orders as of the end of fiscal 2016 will be shipped during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 

&#160; 

Seasonality and Cyclicality 

&#160; 

Demand in our markets is both seasonal and cyclical, driven by the level of construction activity, but can also be impacted by fluctuations in the inventory positions of our customers. From a seasonal standpoint, shipments typically reach their highest level of the year when weather conditions are the most conducive to construction activity. As a result, shipments and profitability are usually higher in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year and lower in the first and second quarters. From a cyclical standpoint, construction activity and demand for our products is generally correlated with general economic conditions, although there can be significant differences between the relative strength of nonresidential and residential construction for extended periods. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers. Wire rod can generally be characterized as a commodity product. We purchase several different grades and sizes of wire rod with varying specifications based on the diameter, chemistry, mechanical properties and metallurgical characteristics that are required for our products. High carbon grades of wire rod are required for the production of PC strand while low carbon grades are used to manufacture WWR. 

&#160; 

Wire rod prices tend to fluctuate based on changes in scrap and other metallic prices for steel producers together with domestic and global market conditions. In most economic environments, domestic demand for wire rod exceeds domestic production capacity and imports of wire rod are necessary to satisfy the supply requirements of the U.S. market. Trade actions initiated by domestic wire rod producers can significantly impact the pricing and availability of imported wire rod, which during fiscal years 2016 and 2015 represented approximately 30% and 29%, respectively, of our total wire rod purchases. We believe that our substantial wire rod requirements, desirable mix of sizes and grades, and strong financial condition represent a competitive advantage by making us a relatively more attractive customer to our suppliers. 

&#160; 

Our ability to source wire rod from overseas suppliers is limited by domestic content requirements generally referred to as &#8220;Buy America&#8221; or &#8220;Buy American&#8221; laws that exist at both the federal and state levels. These laws generally prescribe a domestic &#8220;melt and cast&#8221; standard for purposes of compliance. Certain segments of the PC strand market and the majority of our CPR and ESM products are certified to customers to be in compliance with the domestic content regulations. 

&#160; 

Selling prices for our products tend to be correlated with changes in wire rod prices. However, the timing and magnitude of the relative price changes varies depending upon market conditions and competitive factors. Ultimately the relative supply - demand balance in our markets and competitive dynamics determine whether our margins expand or contract during periods of rising or falling wire rod prices. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We are the nation&#8217;s largest manufacturer of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications. Our markets are highly competitive based on price, quality and service. Some of our competitors, such as Nucor Corporation, Keystone Consolidated Industries, Inc. (&#8220;Keystone&#8221;), Oklahoma Steel and Wire, and Gerdau Long Products North America, are vertically integrated companies that produce both wire rod and concrete reinforcing products and offer multiple product lines over broad geographic areas. Other competitors are smaller independent companies that offer limited competition in certain markets. Our primary competitors for WWR products are Nucor Corporation, Gerdau Ameristeel Corporation, Engineered Wire Products, Inc. (a subsidiary of Keystone), Davis Wire Corporation, Oklahoma Steel &#38; Wire Co., Inc., Concrete Reinforcements Inc. and Wire Mesh Corporation. Our primary competitors for PC strand are Sumiden Wire Products Corporation, Keystone and Wire Mesh Corporation. Import competition is also a significant factor in certain segments of the PC strand market that are not subject to &#8220;Buy America&#8221; requirements. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations. In 2003, we joined together with a coalition of domestic PC strand producers and filed petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce (the &#8220;DOC&#8221;) alleging that imports of PC strand from Brazil, India, Korea, Mexico and Thailand were being &#8220;dumped&#8221; or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and had injured the domestic PC strand industry. The DOC ruled in our favor and imposed anti-dumping duties ranging from 12% up to 119%, which had the effect of limiting the participation of these countries in the domestic market. In 2010, we joined together with a coalition of domestic PC strand producers and filed petitions with the DOC alleging that imports of PC strand from China were being &#8220;dumped&#8221; or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and that subsidies were being provided to Chinese PC strand producers by the Chinese government, both of which had injured the domestic PC strand industry. The DOC ruled in our favor and imposed final countervailing duty margins ranging from 9% to 46% and anti-dumping margins ranging from 43% to 194%, which had the effect of limiting the continued participation of Chinese producers in the domestic market. 

&#160; 

Quality and service expectations of customers have risen substantially over the years and are key factors that impact their selection of suppliers. Technology has become a critical competitive factor from the standpoint of manufacturing costs, quality and customer service capabilities. In view of our strong market positions, broad product offering and national footprint, technologically advanced manufacturing facilities, low-cost production capabilities, sophisticated information systems and financial strength and flexibility, we believe that we are well-positioned to compete favorably with other producers of our concrete reinforcing products. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of October 1, 2016, we had 848 employees, none of which were represented by labor unions. In the event of production disruptions, we believe that our contingency plans would enable us to continue serving our customers, although there can be no assurances that a work slowdown or stoppage would not adversely impact our operating costs and financial results. 

&#160; 

Product Warranties 

&#160; 

Our products are used in applications that are subject to inherent risks, including performance deficiencies, personal injury, property damage, environmental contamination or loss of production. We warrant our products to meet certain specifications. Although actual or claimed deficiencies from these specifications may give rise to claims, we do not maintain a reserve for warranties as the historical claims have been immaterial. We maintain product liability insurance coverage to minimize our exposure to such risks. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We have experienced no material difficulties in complying with legislative or regulatory standards and believe that these standards have not materially impacted our financial position or results of operations. Although our future compliance with additional environmental requirements could necessitate capital outlays, we do not believe these expenditures would ultimately have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. We expect to make capital outlays for environmental control processes associated with our expansion of the Houston facility during fiscal 2017, but do not expect these expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
