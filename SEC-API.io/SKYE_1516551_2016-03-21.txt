History

The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada in 2011 as Load Guard Transportation, Inc. and changed its name to Load Guard Logistics, Inc. in 2012. 

On October 31, 2014, the Company closed a reverse merger transaction (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;) pursuant to which the Company became the 100% parent of our subsidiary Nemus (&#8220;Nemus Sub&#8221;) and assumed the operations of Nemus Sub. On November 3, 2014, the Company changed its name to Nemus Bioscience, Inc. by merging with Nemus Bioscience, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company.

On October 31, 2014, immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Company entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with LGT, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, pursuant to which the Company transferred all of its assets and liabilities to LGT.

On October 31, 2014, the Company entered into a Share Repurchase and Cancellation Agreement with LGT, Yosbani Mendez and Francisco Mendez, pursuant to which the Company repurchased 5,431,460 shares of its common stock (the "Repurchased Shares") from Yosbani Mendez and Francisco Mendez for a repurchase price of all of the issued and outstanding shares of LGT. Upon the repurchase, the Company cancelled all of the Repurchased Shares.

Prior to the Merger, we were a transportation and logistics company engaged primarily in hauling truckload shipments of general commodities in both interstate and intrastate commerce. Nemus Sub was incorporated in the State of California on July 17, 2012.

Business Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and the commercialization of cannabinoid-based therapeutics through our partnership with the University of Mississippi, or UM. UM has held the only contract to cultivate cannabis for research purposes on behalf of the Federal Government since 1968, and it has significant expertise in cannabis cultivation and the extraction, separation, process and manufacture of cannabis extracts containing cannabinoid molecules. We are currently UM's sole partner for the development and commercialization of drugs derived from cannabis extracts, or cannabinoids, and the success of this partnership will depend on the successful navigation of the complex regulatory framework for the cultivation and handling of cannabis in the United States.

Our Strategic Partnership

In July 2013, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding, or MOU, with UM to engage in joint research activities including extracting, manipulating, and studying cannabis in every form to develop intellectual property with the intention to create and commercialize therapeutic medicines. The MOU provides that we own all intellectual property developed solely by our employees and will jointly own all intellectual property developed jointly between Nemus Sub and UM employees. The term of the agreement is five years and the parties agreed to enter into separate research agreements upon the identification of patentable technologies. The agreement may be terminated by either party with three months written notice to the other party.

UM 5050 pro-drug license agreements 

In September of 2014, we entered into three license agreements with UM pursuant to which UM granted us exclusive, perpetual, worldwide licenses, including the right to sublicense, to intellectual property related to UM 5050, a pro-drug formulation of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, for products administered through each of ocular, oral or rectal delivery. The license agreement for the field of oral delivery also includes rights to UM 1250, a bio-adhesive hot-melt extruded film for topical and mucosal adhesion application and drug delivery. Data from UM supports the delivery of the pro-drug through absorptive routes other than the gastrointestinal tract, which we believe helps mitigate the issue of first-pass metabolism by the liver, enhancing drug bioavailability and adding to the predictability of the pharmacokinetics. Further, we have an option for the rights to use UM 5050 for delivery by other means not yet agreed upon and/or in combination with other cannabinoids or other compatible compounds which is renewable every six months and we have continued to renew.

We paid UM upfront license fees under each of the three license agreements. Under each of the three license agreements, we are also responsible for annual maintenance fees that will be credited against royalties in the current fiscal year, contingent milestone payments upon achievement of development and regulatory milestones and royalties on net sales of licensed products sold for commercial use. The aggregate milestone payments under the license agreements if the milestones are achieved is $2.1 million and the potential royalty percentage is in the high-single digits. We must also pay to UM a portion of all licensing fees we receive from any sublicensees, subject to a minimum royalty on net sales by such sublicensees. Our royalty obligations apply on a country by country and licensed product by licensed product basis, and end upon the later of the date that no valid claim of a licensed patent covers a licensed product in a given country, or ten years after first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country.

Each of the three licenses continue, unless terminated, until the later of the expiration of the last to expire of the patents or patent applications within the relevant licensed technology or expiration of our payment obligations under the license. UM may terminate the applicable license agreement, effective with the giving of notice, if: (a) we fail to pay any material amount payable to UM under the relevant license agreement and do not cure such failure within 60 days after UM notifies us of such failure, (b) we materially breach any covenant, representation or warranty in the relevant license agreement and do not cure such breach within 60 days after UM notifies us of such breach, (c) we fail to comply in any material respect with the terms of the relevant license and do not cure such noncompliance within 60 days after UM notifies us of such failure, (d) we are subject to a bankruptcy event, (e) we dissolve or cease operations or (f) if after the first commercial sale of a product during the term of the relevant license agreement, we materially fail to make reasonable efforts to commercialize at least one product or fail to keep at least one product on the market after the first commercial sale for a continuous period of one year, other than for reasons outside our control. We may terminate each license agreement with sixty days written notice to UM.

In September of 2015, the Company entered into a research agreement with UM to advance Nemus&#8217; proprietary cannabinoid-based glaucoma treatment into an optimized once-daily treatment formulation. The fee payable to UM is based on the achievement of certain milestones in the project. The agreement also grants an exclusive option to license the technology from UM within one hundred and eighty days from the commencement of the agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement with thirty days written notice.

UM 8930 pro-drug agreements 

In December of 2015, we executed two license agreements with UM pursuant to which UM granted us exclusive, perpetual, worldwide licenses, including the right to sublicense, to intellectual property related to UM 8930, a pro-drug formulation of cannabidiol, or CBD for products administered through each of ocular or rectal delivery. Further, we have an option for the rights to use UM8930 for delivery by other means not yet agreed upon and/or in combination with other cannabinoids or other compatible compounds which is renewable every six months and we will continue to renew.

We paid UM upfront license fees under each of the two license agreements. Under each of the two license agreements, we are also responsible for annual maintenance fees that will be credited against royalties in the current fiscal year, contingent milestone payments upon achievement of development and regulatory milestones and royalties on net sales of licensed products sold for commercial use. The aggregate milestone payments under the license agreements if the milestones are achieved is $1.4 million and the potential royalty percentage is in the high-single digits. We must also pay to UM a portion of all licensing fees we receive from any sublicensees, subject to a minimum royalty on net sales by such sublicensees. Our royalty obligations apply on a country by country and licensed product by licensed product basis, and end upon the later of the date that no valid claim of a licensed patent covers a licensed product in a given country, or ten years after first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country.

Each of the two licenses continue, unless terminated, until the later of the expiration of the last to expire of the patents or patent applications within the relevant licensed technology or expiration of our payment obligations under the license. UM may terminate the applicable license agreement, effective with the giving of notice, if: (a) we fail to pay any material amount payable to UM under the relevant license agreement and do not cure such failure within 60 days after UM notifies us of such failure, (b) we materially breach any covenant, representation or warranty in the relevant license agreement and do not cure such breach within 60 days after UM notifies us of such breach, (c) we fail to comply in any material respect with the terms of the relevant license and do not cure such noncompliance within 60 days after UM notifies us of such failure, (d) we are subject to a bankruptcy event, (e) we dissolve or cease operations or (f) if after the first commercial sale of a product during the term of the relevant license agreement, we materially fail to make reasonable efforts to commercialize at least one product or fail to keep at least one product on the market after the first commercial sale for a continuous period of one year, other than for reasons outside our control. We may terminate each license agreement with sixty days written notice to UM.

Other UM agreements 

&#160;

In March of 2015, we entered into a research agreement with UM to begin in vitro studies concerning the medical utility of cannabinoids as anti-infective therapeutics for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or MRSA. The fee payable to UM under the agreement is based on the achievement of certain milestones in the project. We recognized $66,747 of research and development expense for work under this contract for the year ended December 31, 2015. We plan to move into in vivo studies of this compound in 2016. Either party may terminate the agreement with 30 days written notice.

&#160;

In December of 2015, we entered into a research agreement with UM to advance specialized cannabinoid derivatives for the treatment of chemo-therapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). The fee payable to UM is based on the achievement of certain milestones in the project. We did not recognize any research and development expense for work under this contract for the year ended December 31, 2015 as work had not yet commenced. The agreement also grants an exclusive option to license the technology from the University within 180 days from the commencement of the agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement with 30 days written notice.

Expenses for Research and Development Activities 

Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $576,093 which consisted of new license fees for the CBD pro drug molecule, license fee renewals, option expenses, and contract research and development fees incurred by UM. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our research and development expenses were $227,500 which consisted of license fees payable to UM to obtain the rights to the UM 5050 THC pro drug.

Our Product Candidates

Cannabinoids are a class of chemically diverse compounds that are extracted from the cannabis plant. These cannabis-derived compounds express their physiological response by binding to specific cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2), which are found throughout the body. Some cannabinoids have been noted to exert multiple effects on the human body, including but not limited to: impacting the immune response, nervous system function and repair, gastrointestinal maintenance and motility, motor function in muscles, pancreatic functionality and blood sugar regulation, and integrity of function in the eye, including the optic nerve. Cannabis and specific cannabinoids have been studied widely, with published data demonstrating the efficacy of these compounds in treating many disorders or alleviating disease-associated symptoms.

We are focused on the development of early stage cannabinoid product candidates. Specifically, UM's research to date has indicated that proprietary cannabinoid chemistry coupled with the innovative, alternative delivery methods, such as ocular, transmucosal and trans-rectal delivery, could have beneficial effects across a spectrum of diseases, including these primary targets:

&#183; Glaucoma and other ocular-related disorders; 

&#183; Palliative care associated with adverse events related to chemotherapy; and 

&#183; Anti-infective activity directed against MRSA. 

The following table summarizes certain information regarding our cannabinoid product candidates:

NB1111

Glaucoma is an ocular neuropathy associated with the initiation of programmed cell death, known as apoptosis, of the retinal ganglion cells, or RGCs, of the optic nerve, resulting in progressive and irreversible loss of vision. Intraocular pressure, or IOP, has been identified as an important risk factor in the pathogenesis of this disease. Elevated IOP can lead to damage of RGC axons through vascular ischemia by compromising blood flow to the cells, and physical crush injury as the elevated ocular pressure compresses these delicate cells. Cannabinoid receptors are highly concentrated in the eye, especially in organs of the anterior compartment that helps regulate IOP, and the posterior compartment in the area of the retina and optic nerve. Stimulation of cannabinoid receptors by THC has been previously shown to lower IOP in both animal and human studies.

&#160;

Our lead ocular compound is NB1111, a prodrug of THC. The molecule has been formulated to make the usually lipophilic THC, more hydrophilic, allowing for easier transport across membranes. In 2013 and 2014, UM conducted studies of the formulation in the rabbit ocular model which showed that the molecule was able to penetrate all chambers of the eye which could potentially broaden therapeutic indications in diseases of the eye that affect the retina and optic nerve, such as macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy. These studies also revealed that the formulation was able to achieve potentially therapeutic concentrations in the anterior compartment, vitreous humor, and posterior compartment of the normal rabbit eye, which is very similar to the human eye in anatomy and physiology. The rabbit ocular model is an accepted animal model for regulatory agencies when considering a candidate drug for human testing and this data will be submitted as part of the investigational new drug application, or IND, to the FDA. 

&#160;

Additional studies using an alpha-chymotrypsin induced glaucoma model in rabbits were performed by UM in 2013 and 2014 under a grant from the National Institutes of Health, or NIH. Those studies showed that NB1111 was able to reduce IOP by 45% to 50%. Reduction in IOP was successful in an almost linear dose-responsive manner, with greater decline in IOP associated with higher dosage concentration. The decline in IOP observed in the rabbit model correlated to historical human data when patients were exposed to systemically administered THC via inhalational methods. The human studies were conducted by the NIH and the U.S. Army in the 1970&#8217;s where glaucoma patients for the NIH study and normal volunteers for the U.S. Army study were exposed to THC by smoking marijuana. Patients tested by the NIH exhibited a decline in IOP ranging from 35% to as high as 65%, correlated to the amount of THC in the plasma. Normal volunteers in the U.S. Army study also showed a decrease in IOP of 10% to 20%. While THC from smoking marijuana was able to reduce IOP in humans, the effect was short lived given the short half-life of the THC molecule. The half-life of the pro-drug used in the rabbit glaucoma model was longer, but still pointed to the need to formulate the pro-drug in a way to lengthen the half-life that would be consistent with once-daily dosing of a marketed product.

&#160;

We examined the compound in further testing using a nanoparticle delivery system to prolong the drug&#8217;s biologic half-life in late 2015. The studies were conducted by UM and placed NB1111 into a solid lipid-nanoparticle system (SLN) to deliver the drug to the eye using topical drop administration. The SLN delivery of NB1111 was administered to rabbits that underwent elevated IOP inducement using the alpha-chymotrypsin model. Data from that experiment confirmed previous studies that showed administration of NB1111 resulted in a 45% reduction in IOP from baseline with a half-life consistent with five to six-times per day dosing. When NB1111 was administered via SLN delivery, the lower concentration of NB1111 (0.4% equivalent THC) exhibited a decrease in IOP of approximately 20% while the higher concentration of NB1111 (0.6% equivalent THC) lowered IOP by 35%. The use of SLN technology lengthened the physiologic half-life of NB1111 equivalent to dosing the drug two to three times a day.

Given the current competitive environment in the glaucoma therapeutic space, the use of topical drops to administer drug is now giving way to the use of implantable devices allowing for sustained release of therapeutics resulting in constant pharmacologic pressure on the etiology of disease. The current market leader in glaucoma therapy is a generic prostaglandin eye drop dosed once-daily. Thus, given the state of the generic market in glaucoma therapy and the paradigm shift to sustained release strategies to enhance compliance, we are pursuing the use of an implantable device that will deliver NB1111 in a safe and effective manner. In addition, we also plan to initiate studies that will assess the direct neuroprotective qualities of cannabinoids like THC in relation to apoptosis of RGCs, the critical issue in the chronic, irreversible loss of vision seen in progressive glaucoma. The ability to show this benefit using NB1111 would result in a strategic competitive advantage for our ophthalmic platform of delivering cannabinoid derivatives of THC and cannabidiol (CBD) to the eye.

We are assessing a number of sustained release delivery platforms and seek to in-license or co-develop the delivery system in conjunction with NB1111 in the first half of 2016. The development pathway will then proceed to assess preclinical animal data, associated toxicology, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies that would comprise an IND-enabling dossier for submission to the FDA. Submission of an IND to the FDA is contingent on having a sustained delivery device for NB1111 and what the associated pharmacokinetic and bioavailability profiles will be using that delivery method. Therefore, guidance on a regulatory submission will be pending based on the completion of obtaining access to a sustained delivery device for NB1111.

Moving forward, if an IND is submitted to FDA and becomes effective, we plan to undertake human testing in patients with underlying glaucoma. We anticipate proposing to the FDA that the first-in-human studies be conducted in patients with glaucoma (Phase 2a) in a traditional dose-ranging study that will also collect safety data and assess which dosages best balance efficacy and safety. Historically, phase 2 studies in glaucoma are conducted over 28-days and patients place the test compound in one eye and the reference comparator in the other eye, thereby acting as their own controls. Given that IOP data is objectively measured, we will decide whether to conduct a subsequent Phase 2b study or go directly to a larger Phase 3 clinical trial based on the quality of the data collected in the Phase 2a and the advice provided by FDA. 

NB1222

NB1222 is a prodrug formulation of THC using the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) as NB1111 but for systemic administration in the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). There were an estimated 15.2 million cancer cases globally in 2014 according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer with projections of 17.1 million cases in 2020. Roughly 25%-30% of cancer patients receive chemotherapy, and of those patients, 70%-80% experience a form of CINV. The global CINV market saw estimated revenue of $1.3 billion in 2014 with a projected 5.7% compounded annual growth rate through 2020 as cancer rates climb with growing, aged populations.

Oral delivery of dronabinol, like many orally administered cannabinoids, results in relatively low bioavailability, coupled with irregular pharmacokinetics secondary to absorption variability and first-pass metabolism by the liver, complicated by the need for multiple dosages per day. In addition, many patients report nausea and/or vomiting as a side-effect related to dosing oral dronabinol. We plan to advance a once-daily suppository form of our proprietary prodrug of THC, NB1222, that is designed to have enhanced bioavailability and more reliable pharmacokinetics, avoid first-pass metabolism by the liver, achieve therapeutic concentrations faster, and avoid the upper gastrointestinal tract mitigating further nausea and vomiting.

Current sales of dronabinol are estimated to be in excess of $110 million in the United States (Source: IMS Health), and management believes that associated product attributes such as appetite stimulation and analgesia, could enhance sales in clinical populations that could benefit from the uniform dosing afforded by prodrug technology. We expect to request a pre-NDA meeting with the U.S. FDA in the first half of 2016 and plan to provide further timeline guidance pending feedback from the FDA. The overall regulatory strategy, pending guidance from the FDA, would be to seek approval of the prodrug formulation of the active moiety in dronabinol, THC, pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which permits approval of an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If we were to seek approval under this pathway, we would propose to rely on FDA&#8217;s prior findings of safety and efficacy in its approval of Dronabinol, which is already approved for CINV.

NB2111

We have in-licensed unique derivatives of cannabidiol (CBD) from UM and based on exploratory research conducted at the University, has embarked on studies exploring the utility of CBD derivatives in the treatment and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).

The CIPN market in the United States approaches $500 million annually (LifeSci Advisors; 2013) and the market for treatment of opioid-induced constipation, which is an adverse event associated with using opioids in treating CIPN, is projected to exceed $600 million globally by 2019 (GlobalData; 2015). We believe that the use of cannabinoids can supplant the dosing of other medications that carry a significant safety and addictive risk, ultimately becoming a mainstay of therapy in this population, especially if cannabinoid use allows for the completion of cycles of chemotherapy.

NB2111 formulation technology is designed to permit better transmembrane translocation of cannabinoids and thereby not rely on dosing cannabinoids via the oral route, which can lead to an erratic pharmacokinetic profile. We expect to complete proof-of-concept in vitro and in vivo studies throughout 2016, resulting in a formulation choice along with a route of delivery that avoids first-pass metabolism by the liver. Anticipated studies will examine the conversion rate of the derivative molecules to the active CBD moiety as well as assessing analgesic response in animal studies. Once a candidate formulation has been identified, that CBD derivative will advance into the requisite IND-enabling studies.

NB31111

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was first described in 1961 after the introduction of the antibiotic, methicillin, and since that time, the prevalence of the organism has increased globally in both community and health-care settings. The prevalence of MRSA in intensive care units in the United States has been estimated to be 60% (Am J Infect Control 2004; 32:470) with more than 90,000 invasive MRSA infections occurring annually in the United States resulting in more than 18,000 deaths (JAMA 2007; 298: 1763-71). Annual costs for treating MRSA in the United States are projected to exceed $4 billion, accounting for a collective 8 million extra hospital days annually (ISPOR; 10 th Annual Meeting, Wash D.C., May, 2005; Pew Foundation Research Brief, April, 2012).

MRSA is classically resistant to conventional antibiotics to treat staph infections such as fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, and macrolides. Most patients who develop MRSA infections are usually colonized with either a community acquired strain (CA-MRSA) or healthcare-associated strain (HA-MRSA). Therefore, antibiotic development against MRSA can take three approaches: a) decolonization, b) treatment of localized soft tissue infections, or c) systemic antibiotic for generalized sepsis.

Cannabinoid molecules have been shown to possess anti-infective activity against a variety of microbial species. We entered into a research agreement with UM in 2015 and continue to test a variety of cannabinoids in various strengths, combinations, and delivery systems against a variety of MRSA species found in community, health-care, and institutional settings such as nursing homes, correctional facilities, and military quarters. We expect to complete the initial screening of a series of cannabinoids against a variety of MRSA species by the fourth quarter of 2016 and plan to seek intellectual property protection for any proprietary findings from these experiments. We anticipate the acquisition of in vivo data on the activity of candidate cannabinoid-based antimicrobial molecules in 2016 that could form the basis of business development activity as that data matures.

Our Competitive Strengths

Cannabis is subject to strict regulation in the United States. Cannabis is classified by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, as a Schedule I substance, which means that, under federal law, it has no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. In addition, the United States is a party to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, which imposes certain requirements and restrictions on member parties with respect to the cultivation and wholesale trade in cannabis. Since 1968, UM has held the only contract with the Federal Government to cultivate cannabis on its behalf for research purposes, and holds the requisite DEA registrations authorizing it to engage in that activity. The contract, which is open for competitive bidding at periodic intervals, is administered by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, or NIDA, an agency within the National Institutes of Health. UM is engaged in a competitive bidding process for the next contract interval and was awarded the contract in 2015. As the sole contract holder since 1968, UM has developed significant expertise in extraction, separation, processing and manufacture of cannabinoids. UM has also engaged in the cultivation of cannabis and the extraction of cannabinoids for purposes of developing drug product candidates apart from its role as NIDA contractor. We have entered into commercial and research agreements with UM and view this collaborative association as a significant strategic advantage in the marketplace.

The only cannabinoid products that are currently approved as drugs in the United States and, to our knowledge, all cannabinoid products in late-stage development, are orally-delivered. Cannabinoids, when ingested orally, are subject to significant first pass metabolism by the liver and potential drug-drug interactions, resulting in very high patient-to-patient variation in bioavailability which can compromise both efficacy and safety. This has been repeatedly published in the literature and in product labeling by regulatory agencies worldwide. These independent assessments correlate with highly variable response rates and safety profiles which, in some cases, have been deemed to have marginal clinical utility.

We have licensed from UM the rights to a pro-drug formulation of THC. Data from UM supports the delivery of the pro-drug through absorptive routes other than the gastrointestinal tract, which we believe may help mitigate the issue of first-pass metabolism by the liver, enhancing drug bioavailability. The three licenses are for delivery of this proprietary formulation through ocular, transmucosal and trans-rectal delivery.

We are also working with UM and other parties on methods to formulate and deliver a variety of other pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoids to better manage symptoms and/or treat diseases.

Our Business Strategy

Our goal is to become the premier developer of prescriptive cannabinoid-based medicines for global markets with significant unmet medical needs. Our current operating strategy includes:

&#160;

&#183; selection of potential clinical targets based on internal and external published data, access to appropriate cannabinoids, and the impact of both developmental and market conditions; 

&#183; prioritization of product candidates based on associated target indications; 

&#183; utilization, where feasible, of naturally-derived drug prototypes leading to synthetically produced cannabinoids for commercialization; 

&#183; development and execution of an intellectual property strategy; 

&#183; development and advancement of our current product pipeline; 

&#183; outsourcing services, such as use of Clinical Research Organizations, or CROs, and contract manufacturers for the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, where possible and appropriate; 

&#183; obtaining necessary DEA registrations; 

&#183; obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for product candidates; 

&#183; research and development of additional target indications for cannabinoid product candidates; and 

&#183; partnering, out-licensing, or selling approved products, if any, to optimize Company efficiencies to bring state-of-the-art therapeutics to patients. 

&#160;

Sales and Marketing

We have not established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure because our lead candidates are still in discovery or preclinical development. If and when we obtain approval to market any of our product candidates, we will evaluate what we believe to be the optimal commercialization path for the company, the respective product candidate, and patients. Commercialization paths may include licensing, selling, or partnering with other commercial partners. We may also choose to build a commercial sales and marketing team for some or all of our product candidates.

Manufacturing

&#160;

We have entered into a lease agreement on a laboratory at UM. The laboratory is in the process of being prepared for development work and is designed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those of the DEA, FDA, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA. We expect that the site will primarily focus on therapeutic discovery and development work.

&#160;

We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities for final manufacture. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of any products that we may commercialize.

We entered into an agreement with Albany Molecular Research Inc. (NASDAQ: AMRI) in February 2016 for the development and manufacture of our proprietary cannabinoid-based active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). It is anticipated that the synthetically generated API will form the basis of our drug candidates NB1111, in development for glaucoma, and NB1222, in development for the management of CINV.

For all of our future product candidates, we aim to identify and qualify manufacturers to provide the API and fill-and-finish services prior to submission of a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.

Intellectual Property

The success of most of our product candidates will depend in large part on our ability to:

&#9679;

obtain and maintain patent and other legal protections for the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;

&#9679;

prosecute our patent applications and defend any issued patents we obtain;

&#9679;

preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and

&#9679;

operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.

&#160;

We intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for certain of our product candidates, drug delivery systems, molecular modifications, as well as other proprietary technologies and their uses by filing patent applications in the United States and other selected global territories. We intend for these patent applications to cover, where possible, claims for medical uses, processes for isolation and preparation, processes for delivery and formulations.

&#160;

As of date of this Annual Report, we have licensed from UM two U.S. patents as well as a foreign counterpart in Japan. The patent that we license for ocular, oral and rectal delivery covers composition of matter and preparation of delta-9 THC amino acid esters and their methods of use and the additional patent that we license for oral delivery covers a hot-melt extruded film for topical and mucosal adhesion applications and drug delivery and process for preparation thereof. These patents are expected to expire at 2029 and 2020, respectively. Under our license agreements, UM retains ownership over the licensed patents and retain control over the maintenance and prosecution of the licensed patents and patent applications. In addition to those licenses, we have one trademark application pending in the United States for Nemus Bioscience, Inc. We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third-party.

Competition

Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, such as pharmaceutical companies, including generic drug companies, biotechnology companies, drug delivery companies and academic and research institutions. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, scientific, technical, intellectual property, regulatory and human resources than we do, and greater experience than we do commercializing products and developing product candidates, including obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals for product candidates. Consequently, our competitors may develop products for indications we pursue that are more effective, better tolerated, more widely-prescribed or accepted, more useful and less costly, and they may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products. We also face competition from third parties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling patients for clinical trials and in identifying and acquiring or in-licensing new products and product candidates.

Government Regulation

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. A failure to comply with such laws and regulations or prevail in any enforcement action or litigation related to noncompliance could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.

Regulation of Cannabis and Cannabinoids

DEA Regulation

Cannabis and cannabinoids are regulated as "controlled substances" as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control of handlers of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.

&#160;

The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Cannabis is listed by the DEA as a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA. Consequently, its manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use is subject to a high degree of regulation. Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.

&#160;

The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. The registered entity must maintain records for the handling of all controlled substances, and must make periodic reports to the DEA. These include, for example, distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. The registered entity must also report thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.

In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. In the event of non-compliance, the DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.

We have not yet applied for or been granted any DEA controlled substance registrations, but we are taking steps to ready our UM-based laboratory for compliance with the regulatory requirements for registration. We believe that UM's knowledge in this area will beneficial to us as we prepare to apply for registrations.

State Regulation

The states also maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements. State authorities, including Boards of Pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.

The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961

Many countries, including the United States, are parties to the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, or the Single Convention, which is an international treaty that governs international trade and domestic control of narcotic substances, including cannabis and cannabis extracts. The Single Convention requires all parties to take measures to limit the production, manufacture, export, import, distribution of, trade in, and use and possession of cannabis exclusively to medical and scientific purposes. In particular, the Single Convention requires member countries to establish a government agency to oversee the cultivation of marijuana and establish a monopoly on the wholesale trade of marijuana, and it provides that this role must be filled by a single government agency if the member country's constitution permits.

Party members, including the United States, may interpret and implement their treaty obligations in a way that restricts our ability to develop and obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in accordance with our current plans and partnership with UM. To date, no natural cannabis or cannabis-derived product has obtained marketing approval in the United States.

&#160;

NIDA

Pursuant to the Single Convention, NIDA oversees the cultivation of research-grade cannabis for medicinal research on behalf of the United States Government. NIDA has historically fulfilled this obligation through a contract that it administers with UM. UM has been the sole NIDA contractor to grow cannabis for research purposes since 1968. The contract is open for competitive bidding at periodic intervals. Since 1999, the term of the contract has been five years. UM engaged in a competitive bidding process for the next contract interval and was awarded the contract in 2015. Under the NIDA contract, UM grows, harvests, stores, ships and analyzes cannabis of different varieties, as NIDA requires.

To obtain cannabis from NIDA for research purposes, researchers must submit a request package that includes, among other things, the name and quantity of substances being requested and a detailed research proposal. Research proposals undergo an interdisciplinary review process administered by the Public Health Service, or PHS. If the researcher satisfies the review and other criteria established by PHS, the researcher will be eligible to receive cannabis at cost through NIDA. NIDA makes the cannabis available to researchers through its contract with UM. To receive cannabis through NIDA, the researcher must have all appropriate DEA registrations. In addition, if the research involves clinical trials in humans, the protocol for the study must be authorized by FDA under an active investigational new drug, or IND, application.

UM has represented that it also grows cannabis for purposes of researching cannabis extracts, and has in the past grown cannabis, purified cannabis extracts, and distributed extracts for purposes of developing product candidates, separate and apart from its contract with NIDA. UM has indicated that it conducted these activities pursuant to separate registrations from DEA and that it plans to seek the necessary additional DEA registrations to conduct the contemplated activities in connection with our partnership, in compliance with applicable law and the United States' obligations under the Single Convention. However, there is a risk that regulatory authorities may disagree and decline to authorize us or UM to engage in these activities, or require us and UM to utilize NIDA cannabis for the development of our product candidates.

U.S. Food and Drug Administration

In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA's refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.

The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

&#160;

&#183; completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; 

&#183; submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#183; approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 

&#183; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication; 

&#183; submission of an NDA to the FDA; 

&#183; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity; and 

&#183; FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

&#160;

Preclinical Studies

Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless, before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.

Clinical Trials

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.

&#160;

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

&#160;

&#183; Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 

&#183; Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 

&#183; Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 

&#160;

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

Marketing Approval

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of "filing" of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes at least twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a "filing" decision. However, if issues arise during the review, FDA may request additional information and the review period may be extended to permit the applicant to provide and FDA to review that information which may significantly extend this time period.

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.

The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.

The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product's continued safety, quality and purity.

&#160;

The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.

Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.

The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all.

After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA's satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. For some products, such as our product candidates, an additional step of DEA review and scheduling is required.

Post-Approval Requirements

Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.

The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety and effectiveness after commercialization.

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.

Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program.

Other potential consequences include, among other things:

&#183; restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 

&#183; fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 

&#183; refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 

&#183; product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 

&#183; injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.

In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.

&#160;

Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products

Hatch Waxman Act

Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA's prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed "abbreviated" because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject's bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.

Hatch Waxman Patent Exclusivity

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant's product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or 505(b)(2) NDA.

The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA's Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

&#160;

&#183; the required patent information has not been filed; 

&#183; the listed patent has expired; 

&#183; the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 

&#183; the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. 

Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed drug. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product's listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.

If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.

&#160;

Hatch Waxman Non-Patent Exclusivity

In addition to patent issues, market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references the previously approved drug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug.

This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for other versions of drug. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a disease or condition that affects populations of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the same indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity.

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations.

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes "any request or demand" for money or property presented to the U.S. government. A violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute also constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. 

Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies' marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses. In addition, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

Pharmaceutical companies are also subject to the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.

In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other health care providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, signed into law on March 2010, created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. Applicable manufacturers are also required to report annually to the government certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, certain states require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other health care professionals and entities.

We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's privacy and security standards directly applicable to "business associates," defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney's fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts.

To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.

The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.

Coverage and Reimbursement

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our products, if approved, could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. By way of example, in the United States, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies' share of sales to federal health care programs. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.

Foreign Regulation

In order to market any product outside of the United States, we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. While our management and many of our consultants are familiar with and have been responsible for gaining marketing approval in many countries, we have not reviewed the specific regulations in countries outside of the United States, as it pertains to cannabinoids.

Additional Regulation

We are a reporting company with the SEC, and, therefore, subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange act of 1934, or Exchange Act, and other federal securities laws, and the compliance obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, our financial reporting is subject to United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and U.S. GAAP is subject to change over time.

We are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations applied to businesses generally. We believe that we are in conformity with all applicable laws in all relevant jurisdictions.

Our Scientific Advisory Board

We intend to assemble a scientific advisory board that includes experts in cannabinoids, drug discovery and medicine. The composition of the Advisory Board will change over time to meet the research and development demands of the Company drug candidate pipeline. The current Advisory Board consists of these three international experts in their fields:

&#183; Dr. Mahmoud ElSohly, works in close collaboration with our team to identify new research directions and accelerate our target validation and drug discovery programs. At UM, Dr. ElSohly serves as the Director of the NIDA Marijuana Project where he carries out a wide range of activities dealing with the chemistry, analysis and product development aspects. 

&#183; Robert N. Weinreb, M.D., Chairman and Distinguished Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of California, San Diego (U.C.S.D.), and Director of the Shiley Eye Institute, joined the company&#8217;s Advisory Board in September, 2015. A globally recognized expert in glaucoma and diseases of the retina, Dr. Weinreb will provide consultative services relating to the development of cannabinoid-based therapies for glaucoma, retinal disease, and basic science analyses of neuroprotection of the optic nerve. 

&#183; Donald I. Abrams, M.D., Professor of Clinical Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (U.C.S.F.) and Chief of the Hematology-Oncology Division at San Francisco General Hospital, joined the company's Scientific Advisory Board in January 2016. He will provide consultative services relating to the use of cannabinoids in palliative care in cancer-associated conditions. 

Our scientific advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. In addition, our scientific advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products or technologies that may compete with ours.

Employees

As of the date of this Annual Report, we have three full-time employees, including one employee with a M.D. degree. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

We anticipate that we will need to hire approximately five employees or independent contractors for our new laboratory at UM. We also intend to utilize independent contractors and outsourced services, such as clinical research organizations (&#8220;CROs&#8221;), and third-party manufacturers, where possible and appropriate.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not descriptions of historical facts are forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. If such risks or uncertainties materialize or such assumptions prove incorrect, our business, operating results, financial condition and stock price could be materially negatively affected. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology including "anticipates," "believes," "can," "continue," "could," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "may," "plans," "potential," "predicts," "should," "will," "would" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated include those set forth in the section titled "Risk Factors" including, without limitation, risks relating to:

&#183; the results of our research and development activities, including uncertainties relating to the discovery of potential product candidates and the preclinical and clinical testing of our product candidates; 

&#183; the early stage of our product candidates presently under development; 

&#183; our need for substantial additional funds in order to continue our operations, and the uncertainty of whether we will be able to obtain the funding we need; 

&#183; our ability to obtain and, if obtained, maintain regulatory approval of our current product candidates, and any of our other future product candidates, and any related restrictions, limitations, and/or warnings in the label of any approved product candidate; 

&#183; our ability to retain or hire key scientific or management personnel; 

&#183; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business, including patent and other intellectual property rights; 

&#183; our dependence on UM, third-party manufacturers, suppliers, research organizations, testing laboratories and other potential collaborators; 

&#183; our ability to develop successful sales and marketing capabilities in the future as needed; 

&#183; the size and growth of the potential markets for any of our approved product candidates, and the rate and degree of market acceptance of any of our approved product candidates; 

&#183; competition in our industry; and 

&#183; regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries. 

We operate in a rapidly-changing environment and new risks emerge from time to time. As a result, it is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this report may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this report speak only as of the date hereof, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.
