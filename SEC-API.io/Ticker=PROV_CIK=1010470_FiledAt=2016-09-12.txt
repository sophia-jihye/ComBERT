 Item 1. Business 

General 

Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;), a Delaware corporation, was organized in January 1996 for the purpose of becoming the holding company of Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B. (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;) upon the Bank&#8217;s conversion from a federal mutual to a federal stock savings bank (&#8220;Conversion&#8221;). The Conversion was completed on June 27, 1996. The Corporation is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB"). At June 30, 2016, the Corporation had consolidated total assets of $1.17 billion, total deposits of $926.4 million and stockholders&#8217; equity of $133.5 million. The Corporation has not engaged in any significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (&#8220;Form 10-K&#8221;), including the audited consolidated financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank and its subsidiaries. 

The Bank, founded in 1956, is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Riverside, California. The Bank is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;), its primary federal regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), the insurer of its deposits. The Bank&#8217;s deposits are federally insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) &#8211; San Francisco since 1956. 

The Bank is a financial services company committed to serving consumers and small to mid-sized businesses in the Inland Empire region of Southern California. The Bank conducts its business operations as Provident Bank, Provident Bank Mortgage (&#8220;PBM&#8221;), a division of the Bank, and through its subsidiary, Provident Financial Corp. The business activities of the Bank consist of community banking, mortgage banking, investment services and trustee services for real estate transactions. Financial information regarding the Corporation&#8217;s two operating segments, Provident Bank and Provident Bank Mortgage, is contained in Note 17 to the Corporation&#8217;s audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

The Bank&#8217;s community banking operations primarily consist of accepting deposits from customers within the communities surrounding its full service offices and investing those funds in single-family, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction, commercial business, consumer and other mortgage loans. The Bank's mortgage banking activities primarily consist of the origination, purchase and sale of single-family mortgage loans (including second mortgages and equity lines of credit). Through its subsidiary, Provident Financial Corp, the Bank conducts trustee services for the Bank&#8217;s real estate transactions and in the past has held real estate for investment. For additional information, see &#8220;Subsidiary Activities&#8221; in this Form 10-K. The activities of Provident Financial Corp are included in the Bank's operating segment results. The Bank&#8217;s revenues are derived principally from interest earned on its loan and investment portfolios, and fees generated through its community banking and mortgage banking activities. 

On June 22, 2006, the Bank established the Provident Savings Bank Charitable Foundation (&#8220;Foundation&#8221;) in order to further its commitment to the local community. The specific purpose of the Foundation is to promote and provide for the betterment of youth, education, housing and the arts in the Bank&#8217;s primary market areas of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The Foundation was funded with a $500,000 charitable contribution made by the Bank in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The Bank contributed $40,000 annually to the Foundation in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014. 

Subsequent Events: 

On July 25, 2016, the Corporation announced that the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.13 per share, reflecting an eight percent increase from the $0.12 per share paid on June 7, 2016. Shareholders of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock at the close of business on August 15, 2016 were entitled to receive the cash dividend, which was paid on September 5, 2016. 

Market Area 

The Bank is headquartered in Riverside, California and operates 13 full-service banking offices in Riverside County and one full-service banking office in San Bernardino County. Management considers Riverside and Western San Bernardino counties to be the Bank&#8217;s primary market for deposits. Through the operations of PBM, the Bank has expanded its mortgage lending market to include most of Southern California and some of Northern California. The Bank is the largest independent community bank headquartered in Riverside County and it has the ninth largest deposit market share of all banks and the fourth largest of community banks in the Riverside - San Bernardino's Ranally Metropolitan Area, defined yearly by Rand McNally &#38; Company. PBM operates two wholesale loan production offices located in Pleasanton and Rancho Cucamonga, California and 14 retail loan production offices located in Carlsbad, City of Industry, Elk Grove, Escondido, Glendora, Livermore, Rancho Cucamonga, Riverside (3), Roseville, Santa Barbara, Victorville and Westlake Village, California. 

The large geographic area encompassing Riverside and San Bernardino counties is referred to as the &#8220;Inland Empire.&#8221; According to the 2010 Census Bureau population statistics, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties have the fourth and fifth largest populations in California, respectively. The Bank&#8217;s market area consists primarily of suburban and urban communities. Western Riverside and San Bernardino counties are relatively densely populated and are within the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. According to the United States of America (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in the Inland Empire in June 2016 was 6.6%, compared to 5.4% in California and 4.9% nationwide, an improvement compared to the unemployment data reported in June 2015, which was 6.5% in the Inland Empire, 6.3% in California and 5.3% nationwide. 

The Inland Empire economy is projected to gain 48,700 jobs or 3.5% in 2016, after adding 58,692 in 2015 or 4.5%. The expansion is expected to continue partly because of the area's traditional advantages for blue collar sectors, as well as continued growth in health care, and small addition of jobs in higher paying sectors. A 26.9% growth is forecasted for lower paying sectors and a 73.1% increase in moderate and better paying jobs (Source: Inland Empire Quarterly Economic Reports - April 2016). 

The California housing market remains very competitive, reflecting a slight increase in sales, particularly in homes priced $300,000 - $399,000, which increased to 18 percent of statewide pending home sales in June 2016 from eight percent in June 2015. Statewide pending home sales rose in June 2016 on an annual basis, with the Pending Home Sales Index increasing 3.2 percent from 123.4 in June 2015 to 127.3 in June 2016, based on signed contracts. With pending sales on a rising trend in the past couple of months, the June 2016&#8217;s increase should portend for higher closed transactions in July 2016 and August 2016. California pending home sales declined 7.0 percent in June 2016 on a monthly basis compared to May 2016, primarily due to seasonal factors. When adjusting pending sales for typical seasonal patterns, pending sales were down 3.2 percent from May 2016 and up 3.0 percent from June 2015.

Competition 

The Bank faces significant competition in its market area in originating real estate loans and attracting deposits. The population growth in the Inland Empire has attracted numerous financial institutions to the Bank&#8217;s market area. The Bank&#8217;s primary competitors are large national and regional commercial banks as well as other community-oriented banks and savings institutions. The Bank also faces competition from credit unions and a large number of mortgage companies that operate within its market area. Many of these institutions are significantly larger than the Bank and therefore have greater financial and marketing resources than the Bank. The Bank&#8217;s mortgage banking operations also face competition from mortgage bankers, brokers and other financial institutions. This competition may limit the Bank&#8217;s growth and profitability in the future. 

Personnel 

As of June 30, 2016, the Bank had 522 full-time equivalent employees, which consisted of 469 full-time, 52 prime-time and one part-time employee. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and management believes that its relationship with employees is good.

Lending Activities 

General. The lending activity of the Bank is predominately comprised of the origination of first mortgage loans secured by single-family residential properties to be held for sale and, to a lesser extent, to be held for investment. The Bank also originates multi-family and commercial real estate loans and, to a lesser extent, construction, commercial business, consumer and other mortgage loans to be held for investment. The Bank&#8217;s net loans held for investment were $840.0 million at June 30, 2016, representing 71.7% of consolidated total assets. This compares to $814.2 million, or 69.3% of consolidated total assets, at June 30, 2015. 

At June 30, 2016, the maximum amount that the Bank could have loaned to any one borrower and the borrower&#8217;s related entities under applicable regulations was $19.4 million, or 15% of the Bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus. At June 30, 2016, the Bank had no loans or group of loans to related borrowers with outstanding balances in excess of this amount. The Bank&#8217;s five largest lending relationships at June 30, 2016 consisted of: three multi-family loans totaling $8.2 million to one group of borrowers; one commercial real estate loan totaling $6.3 million to one group of borrowers; one multi-family loan totaling $5.3 million to one group of borrowers; one multi-family loan totaling $5.0 million to one group of borrowers; and one commercial real estate loan totaling $4.6 million to one group of borrowers. The real estate collateral for these loans is located in Southern California, except for one property which is located in Northern California. At June 30, 2016, all of these loans were performing in accordance with their repayment terms.

Maturity of Loans Held for Investment . The following table sets forth information at June 30, 2016 regarding the dollar amount of principal payments becoming contractually due during the periods indicated for loans held for investment. Demand loans, loans having no stated schedule of principal payments, loans having no stated maturity, and overdrafts are reported as becoming due within one year. The table does not include any estimate of prepayments, which can significantly shorten the average life of loans held for investment and may cause the Bank&#8217;s actual principal payment experience to differ materially from that shown below:

Scheduled contractual principal payments of loans do not reflect the actual life of such assets. The average life of loans is generally substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments. In addition, due-on-sale clauses generally give the Bank the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, the borrower sells the real property that secures the loan. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase, however, when current market interest rates are substantially higher than the interest rates on existing loans held for investment and, conversely, decrease when the interest rates on existing loans held for investment are substantially higher than current market interest rates, as borrowers are generally less inclined to refinance their loans when market rates increase and more inclined to refinance their loans when market rates decrease. 

Single-Family Mortgage Loans . The Bank&#8217;s predominant lending activity is the origination by PBM of loans secured by first mortgages on owner-occupied, single-family (one to four units) residences in the communities where the Bank has established full service branches and loan production offices. At June 30, 2016, total single-family loans held for investment decreased to $324.5 million, or 37.9% of the total loans held for investment, from $366.0 million, or 44.5% of the total loans held for investment, at June 30, 2015. The decrease in the single-family loans in fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to loan principal payments and real estate owned acquired in the settlement of loans, partly offset by new loans originated for investment. 

The Bank&#8217;s residential mortgage loans are generally underwritten and documented in accordance with guidelines established by institutional loan buyers, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the Federal Housing Administration (&#8220;FHA&#8221;) (collectively, &#8220;the secondary market&#8221;). All conforming agency loans are generally underwritten and documented in accordance with the guidelines established by these secondary market purchasers, as well as the Department of Housing and Urban Development (&#8220;HUD&#8221;), FHA and the Veterans&#8217; Administration (&#8220;VA&#8221;). Loans are normally classified as either conforming (meeting agency criteria) or non-conforming (meeting an institutional investor&#8217;s criteria). Non-conforming loans are typically those that exceed agency loan limits but closely mirror agency underwriting criteria. The non-conforming loans are underwritten to expanded guidelines allowing a borrower with good credit a broader range of product choices. Given the recent market environment, PBM has expanded the production of FHA, VA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans. 

The Bank has underwriting standards that require verified documentation of income and assets from borrowers and our underwriting conforms to agency mandated credit score requirements. Generally, mortgage insurance is required on all loans exceeding 80% loan-to-value based on the lower of purchase price or appraised value. Loan-to-value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) is the ratio derived by dividing the original loan balance by the lower of the original appraised value or purchase price of the real estate collateral. The maximum allowable loan-to-value is 97% on a purchase transaction for conventional financing with mortgage insurance and 96.5% loan-to-value for FHA financing with mortgage insurance. Second home purchases and rate and term refinance transactions are capped at 90% loan-to-value with mortgage insurance. Non-owner occupied purchase and rate and term refinance transactions are capped at 80% loan-to-value while non-owner occupied refinance cash-out transactions are capped at 75% loan-to-value. We manage our underwriting standards, loan-to-value ratios and credit standards to the currently required agency and investor policies and guidelines. These standards may change at any time, given changes in real estate market conditions, secondary mortgage market requirements and changes to investor policies and guidelines. 

The Bank offers closed-end, fixed-rate home equity loans that are secured by the borrower&#8217;s primary residence. These loans do not exceed 80% of the appraised value of the residence and have terms of up to 15 years requiring monthly payments of principal and interest. At June 30, 2016, home equity loans amounted to $9.9 million or 3.0% of single-family loans held for investment, 

as compared to $8.9 million or 2.4% of single-family loans held for investment at June 30, 2015. Previously, the Bank offered secured lines of credit, which were generally secured by a second mortgage on the borrower&#8217;s primary residence up to 100% of the appraised value of the residence. Secured lines of credit have an interest rate that is typically one to two percentage points above the prime lending rate. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the outstanding balance of secured lines of credit was $504,000 and $589,000, respectively. 

The Bank offers adjustable rate mortgage (&#8220;ARM&#8221;) loans at rates and terms competitive with market conditions. Substantially all of the ARM loans originated by the Bank meet the underwriting standards of the secondary market. The Bank offers several ARM products, which adjust monthly, semi-annually, or annually after an initial fixed period ranging from one month to five years subject to a limitation on the annual increase of one to two percentage points and an overall limitation of three to six percentage points. The following indexes, plus a margin of 2.00% to 3.25%, are used to calculate the periodic interest rate changes; the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;), the FHLB Eleventh District cost of funds (&#8220;COFI&#8221;), the 12-month average U.S. Treasury (&#8220;12 MAT&#8221;) or the weekly average yield on one year U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year (&#8220;CMT&#8221;). Loans based on the LIBOR index constitute a majority of the Bank&#8217;s loans held for investment. The majority of the ARM loans held for investment have three or five-year fixed periods prior to the first adjustment (&#8220;3/1 or 5/1 hybrids&#8221;) and provide for interest and fully amortizing loan payments throughout the term of the loan. Loans of this type have embedded interest rate risk if interest rates should rise during the initial fixed rate period. 

The Bank also offers interest-only ARM loans, which typically have a fixed interest rate for the first three to five years, followed by a periodic adjustable interest rate, coupled with an interest only payment of three to ten years, followed by a fully amortizing loan payment for the remaining term. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, interest-only, first trust deed, ARM loans were $64.6 million and $152.6 million, or 7.6% and 18.6%, respectively, of the loans held for investment. As of June 30, 2016, $39.1 million of interest-only ARM loans begin to fully amortize in the next 12 months and $25.5 million begin to fully amortize between one year and three years. The reset of interest rates on ARM loans, primarily interest-only single-family loans, to fully-amortizing status has not created a payment shock for most borrowers primarily because the majority of loans are repricing at 2.75% over six-month LIBOR, which has resulted in a lower interest rate than the borrower&#8217;s pre-adjustment interest rate. Management notes that the economic recovery has been slow to develop, which may translate to an extended period of lower interest rates and a reduced risk of mortgage payment shock for the foreseeable future. 

In fiscal 2006, during the Bank&#8217;s 50 th &#32;Anniversary, the Bank offered 50-year single-family ARM loans. At June 30, 2016, the Bank had 25 loans with 50-year terms with $8.5 million outstanding, compared to 27 loans for $9.3 million at June 30, 2015. 

As of June 30, 2016, the Bank had $10.2 million in negative amortization mortgage loans (a loan in which accrued interest exceeding the required monthly loan payment may be added to the loan principal), originated prior to 2008, which consisted of $6.9 million of multi-family loans, $3.1 million of single-family loans and $170,000 of commercial real estate loans. This compares to $14.1 million at June 30, 2015, which consisted of $10.7 million of multi-family loans, $3.2 million of single-family loans and $227,000 of commercial real estate loans. Negative amortization involves a greater risk to the Bank because the credit risk exposure increases when the loan incurs negative amortization and the value of the property serving as collateral for the loan does not increase proportionally. Negative amortization is only permitted up to a specific level, typically up to 115% of the original loan amount, and the payment on such loans is subject to increased payments when the level is reached, adjusting periodically as provided in the loan documents and potentially resulting in a higher payment by the borrower. The adjustment of these loans to higher payment requirements can be a substantial factor in higher delinquency levels because the borrower may not be able to make the higher payments. Also, real estate values may decline and credit standards may tighten in concert with the higher payment requirement, making it difficult for borrowers to sell their properties or refinance their mortgages to pay off their mortgage obligation. 

Borrower demand for ARM loans versus fixed-rate mortgage loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates and the difference between the initial interest rates and fees charged for each type of loan. The relative amount of fixed-rate mortgage loans and ARM loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each product in a given interest rate and competitive environment. Given the recent market environment, the production of ARM loans has been substantially reduced because borrowers favor fixed rate mortgages. 

The retention of ARM loans, rather than fixed-rate loans, helps to reduce the Bank&#8217;s exposure to changes in interest rates. There is, however, unquantifiable credit risk resulting from the potential of increased interest charges to be paid by the borrower as a result of increases in interest rates or the expiration of interest-only periods. It is possible that, during periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on ARM loans may increase as a result of the increase in the required payment from the borrower. Furthermore, the risk of default may increase because ARM loans originated by the Bank occasionally provide, as a marketing incentive, for initial rates of interest below those rates that would apply if the adjustment index plus the applicable margin were initially used for pricing. Because of these characteristics, ARM loans are subject to increased risks of default or delinquency. Additionally, while ARM loans allow the Bank to decrease the sensitivity of its assets as a result of changes in interest 

rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits. Furthermore, because loan indexes may not respond perfectly to changes in market interest rates, upward adjustments on loans may occur more slowly than increases in the Bank&#8217;s cost of interest-bearing liabilities, especially during periods of rapidly increasing interest rates. Because of these characteristics, the Bank has no assurance that yields on ARM loans will be sufficient to offset increases in the Bank&#8217;s cost of funds. 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) requires lenders to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a borrower&#8217;s ability to repay any consumer closed-end credit transaction secured by a dwelling and to limit prepayment penalties. Increased risks of legal challenge, private right of action and regulatory enforcement actions result from these rules. The Bank originates an immaterial number of loans that do not meet the definition of a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; (&#8220;QM&#8221;). To mitigate the risks involved with non-QM loans, the Bank has implemented systems, processes, procedural and product changes, and maintains its underwriting standards, to ensure that the &#8220;ability-to-repay&#8221; requirements of the new rules are adequately addressed.

The FICO score represents the creditworthiness of a borrower based on the borrower&#8217;s credit history, as reported by an independent third party. A higher FICO score indicates a greater degree of creditworthiness. Bank regulators have issued guidance stating that a FICO score of 660 and below is indicative of a &#8220;subprime&#8221; borrower.

A decline in real estate values subsequent to the time of origination of our real estate secured loans could result in higher loan delinquency levels, foreclosures, provisions for loan losses and net charge-offs. Real estate values and real estate markets are beyond the Bank&#8217;s control and are generally affected by changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and other factors. These factors include fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies and acts of nature, such as earthquakes and other natural disasters particular to California where substantially all of our real estate collateral is located. If real estate values decline from the levels at the time of loan origination, the value of our real estate collateral securing the loans could be significantly reduced. The Bank&#8217;s ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and it would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. Additionally, the Bank does not periodically update the LTV ratios on its loans held for investment by obtaining new appraisals or broker price opinions unless a specific loan has demonstrated deterioration or the Bank receives a loan modification request from a borrower. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the LTV ratios disclosed in the following table may be understated in comparison to the current LTV ratios as a result of the year of origination, the subsequent general decline in real estate values that may have occurred prior to 2012 to the extent not fully recovered and the specific location of the individual properties. The Bank cannot quantify the current LTV ratios on its loans held for investment or quantify the impact of the decline in real estate values to the original LTV ratios on its loans held for investment by loan type, geography, or other subsets. 

The following table provides a detailed breakdown of the Bank&#8217;s single-family, first trust deed, mortgage loans held for investment by the calendar year of origination and geographic location as of June 30, 2016:

At time of loan origination. 

Multi-Family and Commercial Real Estate Mortgage Loans . At June 30, 2016, multi-family mortgage loans were $415.6 million and commercial real estate loans were $99.5 million, or 48.6% and 11.6%, respectively, of loans held for investment. This compares to multi-family mortgage loans of $347.0 million and commercial real estate loans of $100.9 million, or 42.2% and 12.3%, respectively, of loans held for investment at June 30, 2015. Consistent with its strategy to diversify the composition of loans held for investment, the Bank has made the origination and purchase of multi-family and commercial real estate loans a priority. During fiscal 2016 the Bank originated $116.0 million and purchased $43.7 million of multi-family and commercial real estate loans, all of which were underwritten in accordance with the Bank&#8217;s origination guidelines. This compares to loan originations of $110.0 million and loan purchases of $16.3 million during fiscal 2015. At June 30, 2016, the Bank had 551 multi-family and 123 commercial real estate loans in loans held for investment. 

Multi-family mortgage loans originated by the Bank are predominately adjustable rate loans, including 3/1, 5/1 and 7/1 hybrids, with a term to maturity of 10 to 30 years and a 25 to 30 year amortization schedule. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Bank are also predominately adjustable rate loans, including 3/1 and 5/1 hybrids, with a term to maturity of 10 years and a 25 year amortization schedule. Rates on multi-family and commercial real estate ARM loans generally adjust monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually at a specific margin over the respective interest rate index, subject to annual interest rate caps and life-of-loan interest rate caps. At June 30, 2016, $363.7 million, or 87.5%, of the Bank&#8217;s multi-family loans were secured by five to 36 unit projects. The Bank&#8217;s commercial real estate loan portfolio generally consists of loans secured by small office buildings, light industrial centers, warehouses and small retail centers. Properties securing multi-family and commercial real estate loans are primarily located in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. The Bank originates multi-family and commercial real estate loans in amounts typically ranging from $350,000 to $4.0 million. At June 30, 2016, the Bank had 62 commercial real estate and multi-family loans with principal balances greater than $1.5 million totaling $152.4 million. The Bank obtains appraisals on all properties that secure multi-family and commercial real estate loans. Underwriting of multi-family and commercial real estate loans includes, among other considerations, a thorough analysis of the cash flows generated by the property to support the debt service and the financial resources, experience and the income level of the borrowers and guarantors. 

Multi-family and commercial real estate loans afford the Bank an opportunity to price the loans with higher interest rates than those generally available from single-family mortgage loans. However, loans secured by such properties are generally greater in amount, more difficult to evaluate and monitor and are more susceptible to default as a result of general economic conditions and, therefore, involve a greater degree of risk than single-family residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be impacted by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. During fiscal 2016, the Bank had net recoveries of $1.4 million in non-performing multi-family and commercial real estate loans, as compared to net recoveries of $283,000 during fiscal 2015. At June 30, 2016, total non-performing multi-family and commercial real estate loans were $709,000, net of allowances and charge-offs, and none were past due 30 to 89 days. Non-performing loans and/or delinquent loans may increase if there is a general decline in California real estate markets and in the event poor general economic conditions prevail.

Construction Mortgage Loans. The Bank originates from time to time two types of construction loans: short-term construction loans and construction/permanent loans. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, the Bank originated a total of $14.7 million and $6.8 million of construction loans, respectively. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Bank had $14.7 million and $8.2 million of construction loans, respectively, of which $11.3 million and $3.4 million, respectively, was undisbursed. 

The composition of the Bank&#8217;s construction loan portfolio is as follows:

Short-term construction loans include three types of loans: custom construction, tract construction, and speculative construction. Additionally, from time to time, the Bank makes short-term (18 to 36 month) lot loans to facilitate land acquisition prior to the start of construction. For additional information on lot loans, see &#8220;Other Mortgage Loans&#8221; below. The Bank provides construction financing for single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate properties. Custom construction loans are made to individuals who, at the time of application, have a contract executed with a builder to construct their residence. Custom construction loans 

are generally originated for a term of 12 months, with fixed interest rates at the prime lending rate plus a margin and with loan-to-value ratios of up to 75% of the appraised value of the completed property. The owner secures long-term permanent financing at the completion of construction. 

&#160; 

The Bank makes tract construction loans to subdivision builders. These subdivisions are usually financed and built in phases. A thorough analysis of market trends and demand within the area are reviewed for feasibility. Generally, significant presales are required prior to commencement of construction. Tract construction may include the building and financing of model homes under a separate loan. The terms for tract construction loans are generally 12 months with interest rates fixed at a margin above the prime lending rate. At June 30, 2016, there were no tract construction loans. 

Speculative construction loans are made to home builders and are termed &#8220;speculative&#8221; because the home builder does not have, at the time of loan origination, a signed sale contract with a home buyer who has a commitment for permanent financing with either the Bank or another lender for the finished home. The home buyer may be identified during or after the construction period. The builder may be required to debt service the speculative construction loan for a significant period of time after the completion of construction until the homebuyer is identified. At June 30, 2016, there were four single-family speculative construction loans of $3.7 million with $2.4 million of undisbursed funds. 

Construction/permanent loans automatically roll from the construction to the permanent phase. The construction phase of a construction/permanent loan generally lasts nine to 12 months and the interest rate charged is generally fixed at a margin above prime rate and with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 75% of the appraised value of the completed property. At June 30, 2016, there was one single-family construction/permanent loan of $478,000, of which $154,000 was undisbursed. 

&#160; 

Construction loans under $1.0 million are approved by Bank personnel specifically designated to approve construction loans. The Bank&#8217;s Loan Committee, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President - PBM and Vice President - Loan Administration, approves all construction loans over $1.0 million. Prior to approval of any construction loan, an independent fee appraiser inspects the site and the Bank reviews the existing or proposed improvements, identifies the market for the proposed project, and analyzes the pro-forma data and assumptions on the project. In the case of a tract or speculative construction loan, the Bank reviews the experience and expertise of the builder. The Bank obtains credit reports, financial statements and tax returns on the borrowers and guarantors, an independent appraisal of the project, and any other expert report necessary to evaluate the proposed project. In the event of cost overruns, the Bank requires the borrower to deposit their own funds into a loan-in-process account, which the Bank disburses consistent with the completion of the subject property pursuant to a revised disbursement schedule. 

The construction loan documents require that construction loan proceeds be disbursed in increments as construction progresses. Disbursements are based on periodic on-site inspections by independent fee inspectors and Bank personnel. At inception, the Bank also requires borrowers to deposit funds into the loan-in-process account covering the difference between the actual cost of construction and the loan amount. The Bank regularly monitors the construction loan portfolio, economic conditions and housing inventory. The Bank&#8217;s property inspectors perform periodic inspections. The Bank believes that the internal monitoring system helps reduce many of the risks inherent in its construction loans. 

Construction loans afford the Bank the opportunity to achieve higher interest rates and fees with shorter terms to maturity than its single-family mortgage loans. Construction loans, however, are generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than single-family mortgage loans because of the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property&#8217;s value at completion of the project and the cost of the project. The nature of these loans is such that they are generally more difficult to evaluate and monitor. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project. If the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be confronted with a project whose value is insufficient to assure full repayment. Projects may also be jeopardized by disagreements between borrowers and builders and by the failure of builders to pay subcontractors. Loans to builders to construct homes for which no purchaser has been identified carry additional risk because the payoff for the loan depends on the builder&#8217;s ability to sell the property prior to the time that the construction loan matures. The Bank has sought to address these risks by adhering to strict underwriting policies, disbursement procedures and monitoring practices. In addition, because the Bank&#8217;s construction lending is in its primary market area, changes in the local or regional economy and real estate market could adversely affect the Bank&#8217;s construction loans held for investment. 

Other Mortgage Loans. There was a total of $332,000 of other mortgage loans at June 30, 2016 as compared to none at June 30, 2015. The Bank makes land loans from time to time, primarily lot loans, to accommodate borrowers who intend to build on the land within a specified period of time. The majority of these land loans are for the construction of single-family residences; however, the Bank may make short-term loans on a limited basis for the construction of commercial properties. The terms generally require a fixed rate with maturity between 18 to 36 months. 

Participation Loan Purchases and Sales. In an effort to expand production and diversify risk, the Bank purchases loans and loan participations, with collateral primarily in California, which allows for greater geographic distribution of the Bank&#8217;s loans and increases loan production volume. The Bank generally purchases between 50% and 100% of the total loan amount. When the Bank purchases a participation loan, the lead lender will usually retain a servicing fee, thereby decreasing the loan yield. This servicing fee approximates the expense the Bank would incur if the Bank were to service the loan. All properties serving as collateral for loan participations are inspected by an employee of the Bank or a third party inspection service prior to being approved by the Loan Committee and the Bank relies upon the same underwriting criteria required for those loans originated by the Bank. As of June 30, 2016, total loans serviced by other financial institutions were $807,000, down 85% from $5.4 million at June 30, 2015. As of June 30, 2016, all loans serviced by others were performing according to their contractual agreements. 

The Bank also sells participating interests in loans when it has been determined that it is beneficial to diversify the Bank&#8217;s risk. Participation sales enable the Bank to maintain acceptable loan concentrations and comply with the Bank&#8217;s loans to one borrower policy. Generally, selling a participating interest in a loan increases the yield to the Bank on the portion of the loan that is retained. The Bank did not sell any loan participation interests in fiscal 2016 or 2015. 

Commercial Business Loans . The Bank has a Business Banking Department that primarily serves businesses located within the Inland Empire. Commercial business loans allow the Bank to diversify its lending and increase the average loan yield. As of June 30, 2016, commercial business loans were $636,000, or 0.1% of loans held for investment, a decrease of $30,000, or 5%, during fiscal 2016 from $666,000, or 0.1% of loans held for investment at June 30, 2015. These loans represent secured and unsecured lines of credit and term loans secured by business assets. 

Commercial business loans are generally made to customers who are well known to the Bank and are generally secured by accounts receivable, inventory, business equipment and/or other assets. The Bank&#8217;s commercial business loans may be structured as term loans or as lines of credit. Lines of credit are made at variable rates of interest equal to a negotiated margin above the prime rate and term loans are at a fixed or variable rate. The Bank may also require personal guarantees from financially capable parties associated with the business based on a review of personal financial statements. Commercial business term loans are generally made to finance the purchase of assets and have maturities of five years or less. Commercial lines of credit are typically made for the purpose of providing working capital and are usually approved with a term of one year or less. 

Commercial business loans involve greater risk than residential mortgage loans and involve risks that are different from those associated with residential and commercial real estate loans. Real estate loans are generally considered to be collateral based lending with loan amounts based on predetermined loan to collateral value and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral is viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets including real estate, the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may not be collectible and inventories and equipment may be obsolete or of limited use. Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial business loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the borrower (and any guarantors), while liquidation of collateral is secondary and oftentimes an insufficient source of repayment. At June 30, 2016, the Bank had $76,000 of non-performing commercial business loans, net of allowances and charge-offs, down 15% from $89,000 at June 30, 2015. During fiscal 2016, the Bank had an $85,000 recovery on commercial business loans, as compared to no net charge-offs or recoveries during fiscal 2015. 

Consumer Loans. At June 30, 2016, the Bank&#8217;s consumer loans were $203,000, or less than 0.1% of the Bank&#8217;s loans held for investment, a decrease of $41,000, or 17%, from $244,000, or less than 0.1% of the Bank's loans held for investment at June 30, 2015. The Bank offers open-ended lines of credit on either a secured or unsecured basis. The Bank offers secured savings lines of credit which have an interest rate that is four percentage points above the COFI, which adjusts monthly. Secured savings lines of credit at June 30, 2016 and 2015 were $77,000 and $109,000, respectively, and were included in consumer loans. 

Consumer loans potentially have a greater risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of loans that are unsecured. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower&#8217;s ongoing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. The Bank had one consumer loan accounted for on a non-performing basis that was fully reserved at June 30, 2016 and none at June 30, 2015. During fiscal 2016, the Bank had $1,000 of net charge-offs on consumer loans, as compared to net recoveries of $1,000 during fiscal 2015. 

Mortgage Banking Activities 

General. Mortgage banking involves the origination and sale of single-family mortgages (first and second trust deeds), including equity lines of credit, by PBM for the purpose of generating gains on sale of loans and fee income on the origination of loans. PBM also originates single-family loans to be held for investment. Due to the recent economic and real estate conditions and consistent with the Bank&#8217;s short-term strategy, PBM has been primarily originating loans and, to a lesser extent, purchasing loans for sale to investors. Given current pricing in the mortgage markets, the Bank sells the majority of its loans on a servicing-released basis. Generally, the level of loan sale activity and, therefore, its contribution to the Bank&#8217;s profitability depends on maintaining a sufficient volume of loan originations. Changes in the level of interest rates and the California economy affect the number of loans originated by PBM and, thus, the amount of loan sales, gain on sale of loans, net interest income and loan fees earned. The origination and purchase of loans, primarily fixed rate loans, was $2.00 billion, $2.52 billion and $1.99 billion during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, including $36.6 million, $40.2 million and $26.1 million, respectively, of loans originated and purchased for investment. The total loan origination volume in fiscal 2016 was lower than fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of a decrease in refinance activity. 

Loan Solicitation and Processing. The Bank&#8217;s mortgage banking operations consist of both wholesale and retail loan originations. The Bank&#8217;s wholesale loan production utilizes a network of approximately 970 loan brokers approved by the Bank who originate and submit loans at a markup over the Bank&#8217;s daily published price. Accepted loans are funded and sold by the Bank. Wholesale loans originated and purchased for sale in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $940.6 million, $1.30 billion and $983.2 million, respectively. PBM has two regional wholesale lending offices: one in Pleasanton and one in Rancho Cucamonga, California, housing wholesale originators, underwriters and processors. 

PBM&#8217;s retail loan production operations utilize loan officers, underwriters and processors. PBM&#8217;s loan officers generate retail loan originations primarily through referrals from realtors, builders, employees and customers. As of June 30, 2016, PBM operated 14 stand-alone retail loan production offices in Carlsbad, City of Industry, Elk Grove, Escondido, Glendora, Livermore, Rancho Cucamonga, Riverside (3), Roseville, Santa Barbara, Victorville and Westlake Village, California. Generally, the cost of retail operations exceeds the cost of wholesale operations as a result of the additional employees needed for retail operations. The revenue per mortgage for retail originations is, however, generally higher since the origination fees are retained by the Bank instead of the wholesale loan broker. Retail loans originated and purchased for sale in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $1.02 billion, $1.18 billion and $983.5 million, respectively. 

The Bank requires evidence of marketable title, lien position, loan-to-value, title insurance and appraisals on all properties. The Bank also requires evidence of fire and casualty insurance on the value of improvements. As stipulated by federal regulations, the Bank requires flood insurance to protect the property securing its interest if such property is located in a designated flood area. 

Loan Commitments and Rate Locks. The Bank issues commitments for residential mortgage loans conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events. Such commitments are made with specified terms and conditions. Interest rate locks are generally offered to prospective borrowers for up to a 60-day period. The borrower may lock in the rate at any time from application until the time they wish to close the loan. Occasionally, borrowers obtaining financing in new home developments are offered rate locks for up to 120 days from application. The Bank&#8217;s outstanding commitments to originate loans to be held for sale at June 30, 2016 and 2015 were $181.8 million and $139.6 million, respectively. For additional information, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. When the Bank issues a loan commitment to a borrower, there is a risk to the Bank that a rise in interest rates will reduce the value of the mortgage before it can be closed and sold. To control the interest rate risk caused by mortgage banking activities, the Bank uses loan sale commitments and over-the-counter put and call option contracts related to mortgage-backed securities. If the Bank is unable to reasonably predict the amount of loan commitments which may not fund (fallout), the Bank may enter into &#8220;best-efforts&#8221; loan sale commitments. For additional information, see &#8220;Derivative Activities&#8221; below. 

Loan Origination and Other Fees. The Bank may receive origination points and loan fees. Origination points are a percentage of the principal amount of the mortgage loan, which is charged to a borrower for funding a loan. The amount of points charged by the Bank ranges from 0% to 2.5%. Current accounting standards require points and fees received for originating loans held for investment (net of certain loan origination costs) to be deferred and amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loan. Origination costs and fees for loans held for sale and loans held for investment recorded at fair value are recognized in non-interest income under gain (loss) on sale of loans, net, as incurred and not deferred. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Bank had $4.4 million and $3.1 million of unamortized deferred loan origination costs (net) in loans held for investment, respectively. 

Loan Originations, Sales and Purchases. The Bank&#8217;s mortgage originations include loans insured by the FHA and VA as well as conventional loans. Except for loans originated as held for investment, loans originated through mortgage banking activities are intended for eventual sale into the secondary market. As such, these loans must meet the origination and underwriting criteria established by secondary market investors. The Bank sells a large percentage of the mortgage loans that it originates as whole loans to investors. The Bank also sells conforming whole loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. For additional information, see &#8220;Derivative Activities&#8221; below.

Mortgage loans sold to investors generally are sold without recourse other than standard representations and warranties. Generally, mortgage loans sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are sold on a non-recourse basis and foreclosure losses are generally the responsibility of the purchaser and not the Bank, except in the case of FHA and VA loans used to form Government National Mortgage Association pools, which are subject to limitations on the FHA&#8217;s and VA&#8217;s loan guarantees. 

Loans previously sold by the Bank to the FHLB &#8211; San Francisco under its Mortgage Partnership Finance (&#8220;MPF&#8221;) program have a recourse provision. The FHLB &#8211; San Francisco absorbs the first four basis points of loss, and a credit scoring process is used to calculate the credit enhancement or recourse amount to the Bank once the first four basis points is exhausted. All losses above this calculated recourse amount are the responsibility of the FHLB &#8211; San Francisco in addition to the first four basis points of loss. The FHLB &#8211; San Francisco pays the Bank a credit enhancement fee on a monthly basis to compensate the Bank for accepting the recourse obligation. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Bank serviced $20.4 million and $28.2 million, respectively, of loans under this program and has established a recourse liability of $242,000 and $267,000, respectively. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, a net (recovery) loss of ($15,000), $32,000 and $139,000, respectively, was realized under this program. 

Occasionally, the Bank is required to repurchase loans sold to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or other investors if it is determined that such loans do not meet the credit requirements of the investor, or if one of the parties involved in the loan misrepresented pertinent facts, committed fraud, or if such loans were 30 days past due within 120 days of the loan funding date. During fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Bank repurchased $1.7 million, $1.6 million and $437,000 of single-family mortgage loans, respectively. However, additional repurchase requests were settled for an aggregate of $470,000, $22,000 and $666,000 in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, that did not result in the repurchase of the loan itself. In fiscal 2016, the Bank entered into a global settlement with one of the Bank&#8217;s legacy loan investors, which eliminated all past, current and future repurchase claims from this particular investor, in exchange for a one-time $400,000 payment. 

Derivative Activities . Mortgage banking involves the risk that a rise in interest rates will reduce the value of a mortgage before it can be sold. This type of risk occurs when the Bank commits to an interest rate lock on a borrower&#8217;s application during the origination process and interest rates increase before the loan can be sold. Such interest rate risk also arises when mortgages are placed in the warehouse (i.e . , held for sale) without locking in an interest rate for their eventual sale to the secondary market. The Bank seeks to control or limit the interest rate risk caused by mortgage banking activities. The two methods used by the Bank to help reduce interest rate risk from its mortgage banking activities are loan sale commitments and the purchase of over-the-counter put and call option contracts related to mortgage-backed securities. At various times, depending on loan origination volume and management&#8217;s assessment of projected loans which may not fund, the Bank may reduce or increase its derivative positions. If the Bank is unable to reasonably predict the amount of loan commitments which may not fund, the Bank may enter into &#8220;best-efforts&#8221; loan sale commitments rather than &#8220;mandatory&#8221; loan sale commitments. Mandatory loan sale commitments may include whole loan and/or To-Be-Announced MBS (&#8220;TBA MBS&#8221;) loan sale commitments. 

Under mandatory loan sale commitments, usually with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or other investors, the Bank is obligated to sell certain dollar amounts of mortgage loans that meet specific underwriting and legal criteria before the expiration of the commitment period. These terms include the maturity of the individual loans, the yield to the purchaser, the servicing spread to the Bank (if servicing is retained) and the maximum principal amount of the individual loans. The mandatory loan sale commitments protect loan sale prices from interest rate fluctuations that may occur from the time the interest rate of the loan is established to the time of its sale. The amount of and delivery date of the loan sale commitments are based upon management&#8217;s estimates as to the volume of loans that will close and the length of the origination commitments. The mandatory loan sale commitments do not provide complete interest-rate protection, however, because of the possibility of loans which may not fund during the origination process. Differences between the estimated volume and timing of loan originations and the actual volume and timing of loan originations can expose the Bank to significant losses. If the Bank is unable to deliver the mortgage loans during the appropriate delivery period, the Bank may be required to pay a non-delivery fee or repurchase the commitments at current market prices. Similarly, if the Bank has too many loans to deliver, the Bank must execute additional loan sale commitments at current market prices, which may be unfavorable to the Bank. Generally, the Bank seeks to maintain loan sale commitments equal to the funded loans held for sale at fair value, plus those applications that the Bank has rate locked and/or committed to close, adjusted by the projected fallout. The ultimate accuracy of such projections will directly bear upon the amount of interest rate risk incurred by the Bank. 

The activities described above are managed continually as markets change; however, there can be no assurance that the Bank will be successful in its effort to eliminate the risk of interest rate fluctuations between the time origination commitments are issued and the ultimate sale of the loan. The Bank completes a daily analysis, which reports the Bank&#8217;s interest rate risk position with respect to its loan origination and sale activities. The Bank&#8217;s interest rate risk management activities are conducted in accordance with a written policy that has been approved by the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors which covers objectives, functions, instruments to 

be used, monitoring and internal controls. The Bank does not enter into option positions for trading or speculative purposes and does not enter into option contracts that could generate a financial obligation beyond the initial premium paid. The Bank does not apply hedge accounting to its derivative financial instruments; therefore, all changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. 

At June 30, 2016, the Bank had put option contracts outstanding with a notional value of $5.0 million and no call option contracts outstanding. This compares to call and put option contracts outstanding with a notional value of $12.0 million and $8.0 million at June 30, 2015, respectively. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Bank had outstanding mandatory loan sale commitments of $4.7 million and $55.2 million, respectively; outstanding TBA MBS trades of $298.0 million and $265.0 million, respectively; outstanding best-efforts loan sale commitments of $29.6 million and $36.9 million, respectively; and commitments to originate loans to be held for sale of $181.8 million and $139.6 million, respectively. For additional information, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Additionally, as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Bank&#8217;s loans held for sale at fair value were $189.5 million and $224.7 million, respectively, which were also covered by the loan sale commitments described above. For fiscal 2016 and 2015, the Bank had a net gain of $742,000 and a net loss of $186,000, respectively, attributable to the underlying derivative financial instruments used to mitigate the interest rate risk of its mortgage banking activities and the fair-value adjustment on loans held for sale. 

Loan Servicing 

The Bank receives fees from a variety of investors in return for performing the traditional services of collecting individual loan payments on loans sold by the Bank to such investors. At June 30, 2016, the Bank was servicing $105.5 million of loans for others, an increase from $80.1 million at June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to loans sold with servicing retained during fiscal 2016, partly offset by loan prepayments. Loan servicing includes processing payments, accounting for loan funds and collecting and paying real estate taxes, hazard insurance and other loan-related items such as private mortgage insurance. After the Bank receives the gross mortgage payment from individual borrowers, it remits to the investor a predetermined net amount based on the loan sale agreement for that mortgage. 

Servicing assets are amortized in proportion to and over the period of the estimated net servicing income and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. The fair value of servicing assets is determined by calculating the present value of the estimated net future cash flows consistent with contractually specified servicing fees. The Bank periodically evaluates servicing assets for impairment, which is measured as the excess of cost over fair value. This review is performed on a disaggregated basis, based on loan type and interest rate. Generally, loan servicing becomes more valuable when interest rates rise (as prepayments typically decrease) and less valuable when interest rates decline (as prepayments typically increase). In estimating fair values at June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Bank used a weighted average Constant Prepayment Rate (&#8220;CPR&#8221;) of 19.68% and 17.50%, respectively, and a weighted-average discount rate of 9.07% and 9.10%, respectively. The required impairment reserve against servicing assets at June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $168,000 and $248,000, respectively. In aggregate, servicing assets had a carrying value of $627,000 and a fair value of $627,000 at June 30, 2016, compared to a carrying value of $396,000 and a fair value of $470,000 at June 30, 2015. 

Rights to future income from serviced loans that exceed contractually specified servicing fees are recorded as interest-only strips. Interest-only strips are carried at fair value, utilizing the same assumptions used to calculate the value of the underlying servicing assets, with any unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Interest-only strips had a fair value of $47,000, gross unrealized gains of $47,000 and an amortized cost of $0 at June 30, 2016, compared to a fair value of $63,000, gross unrealized gains of $62,000 and an amortized cost of $1,000 at June 30, 2015. 

Delinquencies and Classified Assets 

Delinquent Loans . When a mortgage loan borrower fails to make a required payment when due, the Bank initiates collection procedures. In most cases, delinquencies are cured promptly; however, if the loan remains delinquent on the 120th day for single-family loans or the 90th day for other loans, or sooner if the borrower is chronically delinquent, and after all reasonable means of obtaining the payment have been exhausted, foreclosure proceedings, according to the terms of the security instrument and applicable law, are initiated. Interest income is reduced by the full amount of accrued and uncollected interest on such loans. 

The following tables identify the Corporation&#8217;s total recorded investment in non-performing loans by type at the dates and for the periods indicated. Generally, a loan is placed on non-accrual status when it becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest 

or if the loan is deemed impaired, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, where the borrower&#8217;s financial condition is such that collection of the contractual principal or interest on the loan is doubtful. In addition, interest income is not recognized on any loan where management has determined that collection is not reasonably assured. A non-performing loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected on a timely basis. Loans with a related allowance reserve have been individually evaluated for impairment using either a discounted cash flow analysis or, for collateral dependent loans, current appraised value less the costs to sell to establish realizable value. These analysis may identify a specific impairment amount needed or may conclude that no reserve is needed. Loans that are not individually evaluated for impairment are included in pools of homogeneous loans for evaluation of related allowance reserves.

Restructured Loans. A troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;restructured loan&#8221;) is a loan which the Bank, for reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Bank would not otherwise consider. 

The loan terms which have been modified or restructured due to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulty, include but are not limited to: 

a) A reduction in the stated interest rate. 

b) An extension of the maturity at an interest rate below market. 

c) A reduction in the accrued interest. 

d) Extensions, deferrals, renewals and rewrites. 

To qualify for restructuring, a borrower must provide evidence of their creditworthiness such as, current financial statements, their most recent income tax returns, current paystubs, current W-2s, and most recent bank statements, among other documents, which are then verified by the Bank. The Bank re-underwrites the loan with the borrower&#8217;s updated financial information, new credit report, current loan balance, new interest rate, remaining loan term, updated property value and modified payment schedule, among other considerations, to determine if the borrower qualifies.

The Bank assesses loans individually and classifies the loans as substandard non-performing when the accrual of interest has been discontinued, loans have been restructured or management has serious doubts about the future collectibility of principal and interest, even though the loans are currently performing. Factors considered in determining classification include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, collateral value, the financial condition of the borrower and current economic conditions. The Bank 

measures each non-performing loan based on Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 310, &#8220;Receivables,&#8221; establishes a collectively evaluated or individually evaluated allowance and charges off those loans or portions of loans deemed uncollectible. 

During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no newly restructured loans. As of June 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of restructured loans was $4.6 million, comprised of 13 loans. These restructured loans are classified as follows: three loans are classified as special mention and remain on accrual status ($1.3 million) and 10 loans are classified as substandard on non-performing status ($3.3 million). As of June 30, 2016, 41%, or $1.9 million of the restructured loans have a current payment status, consistent with their modified terms. The Bank upgrades restructured single-family loans to the pass category if the borrower has demonstrated satisfactory contractual payments for at least six consecutive months or 12 months for those loans that were restructured more than once and there is a reasonable assurance that the payments will continue. Once the borrower has demonstrated satisfactory contractual payments beyond 12 consecutive months, the loan is no longer categorized as a restructured loan. 

The following table shows the restructured loans by type, net of allowance for loan losses, at June 30, 2016 and 2015:

(1) &#32;&#32;Consists of collectively and individually evaluated allowances, specifically assigned to the individual loan. 

(2) &#32;&#32;There was no related allowance for loan losses because the loans have been charged-off to their fair value or the fair value of the collateral is higher than the loan balance. 

As of June 30, 2016, total non-performing assets, net of allowance for loan losses and fair value adjustments, were $13.0 million, or 1.11% of total assets, which was primarily comprised of: 35 single-family loans ($9.5 million); two multi-family loans ($709,000); one commercial business loan ($76,000); one consumer loan (fully reserved); and real estate owned comprised of four single-family properties ($2.7 million). As of June 30, 2016, 59%, or $6.1 million of non-performing loans had a current payment status. This compares to total non-performing assets, net of allowance for loan losses and fair value adjustments, of $16.3 million, or 1.39% of total assets, of which $8.8 million, or 63%, of non-performing loans had a current payment status at June 30, 2015. 

Foregone interest income, which would have been recorded for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 had the non-performing loans been current in accordance with their original terms, amounted to $118,000 and $101,000, respectively, and was not included in the results of operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Other Loans of Concern. &#32;&#32;As of June 30, 2016, $8.9 million of loans which were not disclosed as non-performing loans were classified as special mention because known information about possible credit problems of the borrowers causes management to have some doubt as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms. Of these loans, $4.9 million were single-family mortgage loans and $4.0 million were multi-family mortgage loans. As of June 30, 2015, $8.2 million of loans which were not disclosed as non-performing loans were classified by the Bank as special mention for the same reasons. 

In addition, as of June 30, 2016, there were no loans which were not disclosed as non-performing loans and that were classified as substandard. As of June 30, 2015, $6.6 million of loans which were not disclosed as non-performing loans were classified by the Bank as substandard because the loans have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected but they are performing in accordance with the contractual 

loan agreements. Of these loans, $5.3 million were multi-family mortgage loans, $943,000 were commercial real estate loans and $350,000 were single-family mortgage loans. 

Foreclosed Real Estate. Real estate acquired by the Bank as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until it is sold. When a property is acquired, it is recorded at its market value less the estimated cost of sale. Subsequent declines in value are charged to operations. As of June 30, 2016, the real estate owned balance was $2.7 million (four properties), consisting of four single-family residences located in California and Arizona, compared to $2.4 million (three properties) at June 30, 2015, consisting of two single-family residences and one commercial real estate property located in Southern California. In managing the real estate owned properties for quick disposition, the Bank completes the necessary repairs and maintenance to the individual properties before listing for sale, obtains new appraisals and broker price opinions (&#8220;BPO&#8221;) to determine current market listing prices, and engages local realtors who are most familiar with real estate sub-markets, among other techniques, which generally results in the quick disposition of real estate owned. 

Asset Classification. The OCC has adopted various regulations regarding the problem assets of savings institutions. The regulations require that each institution review and classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with examinations of institutions, OCC examiners have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss. Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified as a loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. If an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss, the institution establishes an individually evaluated allowance and may subsequently charge-off the amount of the asset classified as loss. A portion of the allowance for loan losses established to cover probable losses related to assets classified substandard or doubtful may be included in determining an institution&#8217;s regulatory capital. Assets that do not currently expose the institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as special mention and are closely monitored by the Bank. 

The aggregate amounts of the Bank&#8217;s classified assets, including loans classified by the Bank as special mention, were as follows at the dates indicated:

Classified assets decreased at June 30, 2016 from the June 30, 2015 level primarily due to loan classification upgrades, disposition of real estate owned properties and a general improvement in the real estate market, resulting in fewer delinquent loans. The classified assets are primarily located in Southern California. 

Not all of the Bank&#8217;s classified assets are delinquent or non-performing. In determining whether the Bank&#8217;s assets expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification, the Bank may consider various factors, including the payment history of the borrower, the loan-to-value ratio, and the debt coverage ratio of the property securing the loan. After consideration of these factors, the Bank may determine that the asset in question, though not currently delinquent, presents a risk of loss that requires it to be classified or designated as special mention. In addition, the Bank&#8217;s loans held for investment may include single-family, commercial and multi-family real estate loans with a balance exceeding the current market value of the collateral which are not classified because they are performing and have borrowers who have sufficient resources to support the repayment of the loan. 

Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained to cover losses inherent in the loans held for investment. In originating loans, the Bank recognizes that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with, among other factors, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan, general economic conditions and, in the case of a secured loan, the quality of the collateral securing the loan. The responsibility for the review of the Bank&#8217;s assets and the determination of the adequacy of the allowance lies with the Internal Asset Review Committee (&#8220;IAR Committee&#8221;). The Bank adjusts its allowance for loan losses by charging or crediting its provision for loan losses against the Bank&#8217;s operations. 

The Bank has established a methodology for the determination of the provision for loan losses. The methodology is set forth in a formal policy and takes into consideration the need for a collectively evaluated allowance for groups of homogeneous loans and an individually evaluated allowance that are tied to individual problem loans. The Bank&#8217;s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements. 

The allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to the loans held for investment. The loss factors are applied according to loan program type and loan classification. The loss factors for each program type and loan classification are established based on an evaluation of the historical loss experience, prevailing market conditions, concentration in loan types and other relevant factors consistent with ASC 450, &#8220;Contingency&#8221;. Homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage, home equity and consumer installment loans are considered on a pooled loan basis. A factor is assigned to each pool based upon expected charge-offs for one year. The factors for larger, less homogeneous loans, such as construction and commercial real estate loans, are based upon loss experience tracked over business cycles considered appropriate for the loan type. 

Collectively evaluated or individually evaluated allowances are established to absorb losses on loans for which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured as prescribed in ASC 310. Estimates of identifiable losses are reviewed continually and, generally, a provision (recovery) for losses is charged (credited) against operations on a quarterly basis as necessary to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level. Management presents the minutes summarizing the actions of the IAR Committee to the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. 

Non-performing loans are charged-off to their fair market values in the period the loans, or portion thereof, are deemed uncollectible, generally after the loan becomes 150 days delinquent for real estate secured first trust deed loans and 120 days delinquent for commercial business or real estate secured second trust deed loans. For loans that were modified from their original terms, were re-underwritten and identified in the Corporation&#8217;s asset quality reports as troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;restructured loans&#8221;), the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes 90 days delinquent; and where borrowers file bankruptcy, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes 60 days delinquent. The amount of the charge-off is determined by comparing the loan balance to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less disposition costs, with the loan balance in excess of the estimated fair value charged-off against the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses for non-performing loans is determined by applying Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 310, &#8220;Receivables.&#8221; For restructured loans that are less than 90 days delinquent, the allowance for loan losses are segregated into (a) individually evaluated allowances for those loans with applicable discounted cash flow calculations still in their restructuring period, classified lower than pass, and containing an embedded loss component or (b) collectively evaluated allowances based on the aggregated pooling method. For non-performing loans less than 60 days delinquent where the borrower has filed bankruptcy, the collectively evaluated allowances are assigned based on the aggregated pooling method. For non-performing commercial real estate loans, an individually evaluated allowance is calculated based on the loan's fair value and if the fair value is higher than the loan balance, no allowance is required. 

The IAR Committee meets quarterly to review and monitor conditions in the portfolio and to determine the appropriate allowance for loan losses. To the extent that any of these conditions are apparent by identifiable problem loans or portfolio segments as of the evaluation date, the IAR Committee&#8217;s estimate of the effect of such conditions may be reflected as an individually evaluated allowance applicable to such loans or portfolio segments. Where any of these conditions is not apparent by specifically identifiable problem loans or portfolio segments as of the evaluation date, the IAR Committee&#8217;s evaluation of the probable loss related to such condition is reflected in the general allowance. The intent of the IAR Committee is to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses. Pooled loan factors are adjusted to reflect current estimates of charge-offs for the subsequent 12 months. Loss activity is reviewed for non-pooled loans and the loss factors are adjusted, if necessary. By assessing the probable estimated losses inherent in the loans held for investment on a quarterly basis, the Bank is able to adjust specific and inherent loss estimates based upon the most recent information that has become available. 

At June 30, 2016, the Bank had an allowance for loan losses of $8.7 million, or 1.02% of gross loans held for investment, compared to an allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2015 of $8.7 million, or 1.06% of gross loans held for investment. A $1.7 million recovery from the allowance for loan losses was recorded in fiscal 2016, compared to a $1.4 million recovery from the allowance 

for loan losses in fiscal 2015. Although management believes the best information available is used to make such (recovery) provision, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. 

The Bank&#8217;s first trust deed, single-family mortgage loans held for investment contain certain non-traditional underwriting characteristics (e.g. interest only, stated income, negative amortization, FICO less than or equal to 660, and/or over 30-year amortization schedule) as described in the section above entitled "Single-Family Mortgage Loans" in this Form 10-K. These loans may have a greater risk of default in comparison to single-family mortgage loans that have been underwritten with more stringent requirements. As a result, the Bank may experience higher future levels of non-performing single-family loans that may require additional allowances for loan losses and may adversely affect the Bank&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. 

While the Bank believes that it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with GAAP, there can be no assurance that regulators, in reviewing the Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio, will not recommend that the Bank significantly increase its allowance for loan losses. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect the Bank&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. 

The following table sets forth an analysis of the Bank&#8217;s allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated. Where individually evaluated allowances have been established, any differences between the individually evaluated allowances and the amount of loss realized has been charged or credited to current operations.

The following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the periods indicated. Management believes that the allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis. The allocation of the allowance is based upon an asset classification matrix. The allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance in one category to absorb losses in any other categories.

Investment Securities Activities 

Federally chartered savings institutions are permitted under federal and state laws to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies and government sponsored enterprises and of state and municipal governments, deposits at the FHLB, certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions, certain bankers&#8217; acceptances, mortgage-backed securities and federal funds. Subject to various restrictions, federally chartered savings institutions may also invest a portion of their assets in commercial paper and corporate debt securities. Savings institutions such as the Bank are also required to maintain an investment in FHLB &#8211; San Francisco stock. 

The investment policy of the Bank, established by the Board of Directors and implemented by the Bank&#8217;s Asset-Liability Committee, seeks to provide and maintain adequate liquidity, complement the Bank&#8217;s lending activities, and generate a favorable return on investment without incurring undue interest rate risk or credit risk. Investments are made based on certain considerations, such as yield, credit quality, maturity, liquidity and marketability. The Bank also considers the effect that the proposed investment would have on the Bank&#8217;s risk-based capital requirements and interest rate risk sensitivity. 

At June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Bank&#8217;s investment securities portfolio was $51.5 million and $15.0 million, respectively, which primarily consisted of federal agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations. The Bank&#8217;s investment securities portfolio was classified as held to maturity and available for sale. The Corporation purchased mortgage-backed securities available for sale totaling $41.7 million during fiscal 2016. 

The following table sets forth the composition of the Bank&#8217;s investment portfolio at the dates indicated:

The actual maturity for MBS may differ from the stated maturity due to scheduled amortization and loan prepayments. 

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds 

General. Deposits, the proceeds from loan sales and loan repayments are the major sources of the Bank&#8217;s funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are influenced significantly by general interest rates and money market conditions. Loan sales are also influenced significantly by general interest rates. Borrowings through the FHLB &#8211; San Francisco and repurchase agreements may be used to compensate for declines in the availability of funds from other sources. 

&#160; 

Deposit Accounts. Substantially all of the Bank&#8217;s depositors are residents of the State of California. Deposits are attracted from within the Bank&#8217;s market area by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments, including checking, savings, money market and time deposits. Deposit account terms vary, differentiated by the minimum balance required, the time periods that the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of its deposit accounts, the Bank considers current interest rates, profitability to the Bank, interest rate risk characteristics, competition and its customers&#8217; preferences and concerns. Generally, the Bank&#8217;s deposit rates are commensurate with the median rates of its competitors within a given market. The Bank may occasionally pay above-market interest rates to attract or retain deposits when less expensive sources of funds are not available. The Bank may also pay above-market interest rates in specific markets in order to increase the deposit base of a particular office or group of offices. The Bank reviews its deposit composition and pricing on a weekly basis. 

The Bank generally offers time deposits for terms not exceeding seven years. As illustrated in the following table, time deposits represented 33% of the Bank&#8217;s deposit portfolio at June 30, 2016, compared to 37% at June 30, 2015. As of June 30, 2016, total brokered deposits were $1.6 million with a weighted average interest rate of 3.88% and remaining maturities within three years. At June 30, 2015, total brokered deposits were $3.0 million with a weighted average interest rate of 3.76% and remaining maturities between one and four years. The Bank attempts to reduce the overall cost of its deposit portfolio and to increase its franchise value by emphasizing transaction accounts, which are subject to a heightened degree of competition. For additional information, see Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in this Form 10-K.

Borrowings. The FHLB &#8211; San Francisco functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions. As a member, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB &#8211; San Francisco and is authorized to apply for advances using such stock and certain of its mortgage loans and other assets (principally investment securities) as collateral, provided certain creditworthiness standards have been met. Advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate, maturity, terms and conditions. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit. The Bank utilizes advances from the FHLB &#8211; San Francisco as an alternative to deposits to supplement its supply of lendable funds, to meet deposit withdrawal requirements and to help manage interest rate risk. The FHLB &#8211; San Francisco has, from time to time, served as the Bank&#8217;s primary borrowing source. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the FHLB &#8211; San Francisco borrowing capacity was limited to 35% of the Bank&#8217;s total assets at both dates. Advances from the FHLB &#8211; San Francisco are typically secured by the Bank&#8217;s single-family residential, multi-family and commercial real estate mortgage loans. Total mortgage loans pledged to the FHLB &#8211; San Francisco were $776.5 million at June 30, 2016 as compared to $767.3 million at June 30, 2015. In addition, the Bank pledged investment securities totaling $591,000 at June 30, 2016 as compared to $698,000 at June 30, 2015 to collateralize its FHLB &#8211; San Francisco advances under the Securities-Backed Credit (&#8220;SBC&#8221;) facility. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Bank had $91.3 million and $91.4 million of borrowings, respectively, from the FHLB &#8211; San Francisco with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.78% at both dates. At June 30, 2016, the outstanding borrowings mature between 2017 and 2025 with a weighted average maturity of 69 months. In addition to the total borrowings mentioned above, the Bank utilized its borrowing facility for letters of credit and MPF credit enhancement. The outstanding letters of credit at June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $8.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively; and the outstanding MPF credit enhancement was $2.5 million at both dates. For additional information, see Note 8 to the Corporation's audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the remaining financing availability was $309.0 million and $324.0 million, respectively, with remaining available collateral of $586.9 million and $587.9 million, respectively. In addition, as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Bank had secured a discount window facility of $46.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively, at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, collateralized by investment securities with a fair market value of $49.4 million and $13.0 million, respectively. The Bank also has a federal funds facility with its correspondent bank for $12.0 million which matures on July 31, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the discount window facility or the federal funds facility with the correspondent bank.

Also in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Bank received cash dividends on the FHLB &#8211; San Francisco stock of $721,000, $796,000 and $793,000, respectively. The cash dividends received on the FHLB - San Francisco stock in fiscal 2015 include a $261,000 special cash dividend. 

Subsidiary Activities 

Federal savings institutions generally may invest up to 3% of their assets in service corporations, provided that at least one-half of any amount in excess of 1% is used primarily for community, inner-city and community development projects. The Bank&#8217;s investment in its service corporations did not exceed these limits at June 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The Bank has three wholly owned subsidiaries: Provident Financial Corp (&#8220;PFC&#8221;), Profed Mortgage, Inc., and First Service Corporation. PFC&#8217;s current activities include: (i) acting as trustee for the Bank&#8217;s real estate transactions and (ii) holding real estate for investment, if any. Profed Mortgage, Inc., which formerly conducted the Bank&#8217;s mortgage banking activities, and First Service Corporation are currently inactive. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Bank&#8217;s investment in its subsidiaries was $57,000 and $72,000, respectively. 

REGULATION 

The following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations which are applicable to the Corporation and the Bank. The description of these laws and regulations, as well as descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations. 

Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress that may affect the Corporation&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s operations. In addition, the regulations governing the Corporation and the Bank may be amended from time to time by the OCC, FDIC, Federal Reserve Board, the SEC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), as appropriate. Any such legislation or regulatory changes could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the Corporation and the Bank and no prediction can be made as to whether any such changes may occur. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and is affecting the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Bank&#8217;s former federal banking regulator, and responsibility for the supervision and regulation of federal savings associations such as the Bank was transferred to the OCC July 21, 2011. The OCC is the agency that is primarily responsible for the regulation and supervision of national banks. Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board. The CFPB assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. The Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB with respect to our compliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations. 

Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to delayed effective dates and/or rulemaking by the federal banking agencies. Their impact on operations cannot yet be fully assessed. However, it is likely that the Dodd-Frank Act will increase the regulatory burden, compliance costs and interest expense for the Corporation, the Bank and the financial services industry more generally. 

General 

The Bank, as a federally chartered savings institution, is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC, as its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, as its insurer of deposits. The Bank's relationship with its depositors and borrowers is regulated by federal consumer protection laws, and the CFPB issues regulations under those laws, which must be complied with by the Bank. The Bank is a member of the FHLB System and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank must file reports with the OCC and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations by the OCC to evaluate the Bank&#8217;s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. Under certain circumstances, the FDIC may also examine the Bank. This regulatory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which the Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss allowances for regulatory purposes. Any change in such policies, whether by the OCC, the FDIC or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation and the Bank and their operations. The Corporation, as a savings and loan holding company, is required to file certain reports with, is subject to examination by, and otherwise must comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, its primary regulator. The Corporation is also subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws. For additional information, see &#8220;Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulations&#8221; below in this Form 10-K. 

Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions 

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The OCC has extensive authority over the operations of federally chartered savings institutions. As part of this authority, the Bank is required to file periodic reports with the OCC and is subject to periodic examinations by the OCC and the FDIC. The OCC also has extensive enforcement authority over all federally chartered savings institutions, including the Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease-and-desist orders and initiate injunctive actions. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with the OCC. Except under certain circumstances, public disclosure of final enforcement actions by the OCC is required by law. 

All savings institutions must pay assessments to the OCC, to fund the agency&#8217;s operations. The general assessments, paid on a semi-annual basis, are determined based on the savings institution&#8217;s total assets, including consolidated subsidiaries. The Bank&#8217;s OCC annual assessment for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $275,000, $263,000 and $270,000, respectively. 

Federal law provides that federally chartered savings institutions are generally subject to the national bank limit on loans to one borrower. A federally chartered savings institution may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers 

in excess of 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by specified readily marketable collateral. The Bank&#8217;s limit on loans to one borrower or group of related borrowers was $19.4 million and $20.3 million, at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At June 30, 2016, the Bank&#8217;s largest lending relationship to a single borrower or group of borrowers were three multi-family loans totaling $8.2 million, which were performing according to their original payment terms. 

The OCC, as well as the other federal banking agencies, has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation, asset quality, earnings, internal controls and audit systems, interest rate risk exposure and compensation and other employee benefits. Any institution that fails to comply with these standards must submit a compliance plan. 

The OCC&#8217;s oversight of the Bank includes reviewing its compliance with the customer privacy requirements imposed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) and the anti-money laundering provisions of the USA Patriot Act of 2001. The GLBA privacy requirements place limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information with unaffiliated third parties. They also require each financial institution offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with its privacy policy and with the opportunity to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of the sharing of their personal information with unaffiliated third parties. The USA Patriot Act significantly expands the responsibilities of financial institutions in preventing the use of the United States financial system to fund terrorist activities. Its anti-money laundering provisions require financial institutions operating in the United States to develop anti-money laundering compliance programs and due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. These compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB &#8211; San Francisco, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs that administer the home financing credit function of member financial institutions. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures, established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Bank had $91.3 million and $91.4 million of outstanding advances, respectively, from the FHLB &#8211; San Francisco with a remaining available credit facility of $309.0 million and $324.0 million, respectively, based on 35% of total assets for both dates, which is limited to available collateral. For additional information, see &#8220;Business &#8211; Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds &#8211; Borrowings&#8221; above in this Form 10-K. 

As a member of the FHLB - San Francisco, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB &#8211; San Francisco. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Bank held $8.1 million of FHLB-San Francisco stock at both dates which was in compliance with this membership requirement. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, there was no excess capital redemption. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, the FHLB &#8211; San Francisco distributed $721,000, $796,000 and $793,000 of cash dividends, respectively, to the Bank. There is no guarantee that the FHLB &#8211; San Francisco will maintain its cash dividend and redemption of excess capital stock held by its members. 

Under federal law, the FHLB is required to contribute to low and moderately priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low and moderate income housing projects. These contributions have in the past adversely affected the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions also could have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A reduction in value of the Bank's FHLB stock may result in a corresponding reduction in the Bank&#8217;s capital. 

Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) of the FDIC. Deposits are insured up to $250,000 per account owner by the FDIC, backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the insurance fund. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings institutions, after giving the OCC an opportunity to take such action, and may terminate the savings institution's deposit insurance if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. Management of the Bank is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank's deposit insurance. 

The FDIC imposes an assessment for deposit insurance on all depository institutions. Under the FDIC&#8217;s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution&#8217;s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations, with institutions deemed less risky paying lower assessments. Currently, assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) range from 2 &#189; to 45 basis points of each institution&#8217;s total assets less tangible capital. The FDIC may increase or decrease the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking. The FDIC&#8217;s current system represents a change, required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution&#8217;s volume of deposits. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020 with insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more funding the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC and the FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long term fund ratio of 2%. 

&#160; 

The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. No predictions can be made as to what assessment rates will be in the future. 

In addition to the assessment for deposit insurance, institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund. These assessments, which may be revised based upon the level of DIF deposits, will continue until the bonds mature in the years 2017 through 2019. This payment is established quarterly and during the Financing Corporation's year ending March 31, 2016 averaged 6.42 basis points (annualized) of assessable assets. The Financing Corporation was chartered in 1987 solely for the purpose of functioning as a vehicle for the recapitalization of the deposit insurance system. 

Qualified Thrift Lender Test. All savings institutions, including the Bank, are required to meet a qualified thrift lender (&#8220;QTL&#8221;) test to avoid certain restrictions on their operations. This test requires a savings institution to have at least 65% of its total assets as defined by regulation, in qualified thrift investments on a monthly average for nine out of every 12 month period on a rolling basis. As an alternative, a savings institution may maintain 60% of its assets in those assets specified in Section 7701(a)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code (&#8220;Code&#8221;). Under either test, such assets primarily consist of residential housing related loans and investments. 

A savings institution that fails to meet the QTL is subject to certain operating restrictions and the Dodd-Frank Act also specifies that failing the QTL test is a violation of law that could result in an enforcement action and dividend limitations. As of June 30, 2016, the Bank maintained 94.5% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and, therefore, met the qualified thrift lender test. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, the Bank was in compliance with the QTL tests as of each month end during the stated fiscal years. 

Capital Requirements. Federally insured savings institutions, such as the Bank, are required by the OCC to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, in July 2013, the OCC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revises the comprehensive regulatory capital framework for all U.S. financial institutions and their holding companies including the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The final rule applies to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more and top-tier savings and loan holding companies. 

The Bank is subject to the capital requirements adopted by the OCC, and the Corporation is subject to the same capital requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve Board. These requirements created a required ratio for common equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) capital, increased the leverage and Tier 1 capital ratios, changed the risk-weightings of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, created an additional capital conservation buffer over the required capital ratios and changed what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting these various capital requirements. Under the capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios applicable to the Bank for calendar 2016 are: (i) a CETI capital ratio of 5.125%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.625%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.625%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. 

There are a number of changes in what constitutes regulatory capital, subject to transition periods. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. The Bank does not have any of these instruments. Mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are deducted from capital subject to a transition period ending December 31, 2017. In addition, Tier 1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt, equity securities and interest-only strips, subject to a transition period ending December 

31, 2017. Because of our asset size, we were given a one-time option to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt, equity securities and interest-only strips in our capital calculations. We elected to exercise this option to opt-out in order to reduce the impact of market volatility on our regulatory capital levels. 

The requirements also include changes in the risk-weightings of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposure. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (currently set at 0%); a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital; and increased risk-weights (0% to 600%) for equity exposures. 

As noted above, in addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. This capital conservation buffer requirement began to be phased in starting in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented at 2.5% in January 2019. Failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer will limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses. If the Bank does not have the ability to pay dividends to the Corporation, the Corporation may be limited in its ability to pay dividends to its stockholders. 

Under the current standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the Bank must have a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% (increased from 6%), a total capital ratio of 10% (unchanged) and a Tier1 leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged). As of June 30, 2016, the most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

Prompt Corrective Action. &#32;&#32;The OCC is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings institutions, the severity of which depends upon the institution's degree of undercapitalization. Subject to a narrow exception, the OCC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings institution that is "critically undercapitalized." OCC regulations also require that a capital restoration plan be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a savings institution receives notice that it is "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" or "critically undercapitalized." In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution, including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. &#8220;Significantly undercapitalized&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; institutions are subject to more extensive mandatory regulatory actions. The OCC also could take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. At June 30, 2016, the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios met the regulatory capital requirements described above and the additional requirements imposed by the OCC &#32; to be considered as "well capitalized." 

Limitations on Capital Distributions. OCC regulations impose various restrictions on savings institutions on their ability to make distributions of capital, which include dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account. Generally, savings institutions, such as the Bank, that before and after the proposed distribution are well-capitalized, may make capital distributions during any calendar year up to 100% of net income for the year-to-date plus retained net income for the two preceding years. However, an institution deemed to be in need of more than normal supervision or in troubled condition by the OCC may have its dividend authority restricted by the OCC. If the Bank, however, proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet its capital requirements (or will not following the proposed capital distribution) or that will exceed these net income-based limitations, it must obtain the OCC's approval prior to making such distribution. In addition, the Bank must file a prior written notice of a dividend with the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board or the OCC may object to a capital distribution based on safety and soundness concerns. Additional restrictions on Bank dividends may apply if the Bank fails the QTL test. In addition, as noted above, beginning in 2016, if the Bank does not have the required capital conservation buffer, its ability to pay dividends to the Corporation would be limited, which may limit the ability of the Corporation to pay dividends to its stockholders. 

Activities of Savings Associations and Their Subsidiaries. When a savings institution establishes or acquires a subsidiary or elects to conduct any new activity through a subsidiary that the association controls, the savings institution must notify the FDIC and the OCC 30 days in advance and provide the required information in connection with such notification. Savings institutions also must conduct the activities of subsidiaries in accordance with existing regulations and orders. 

The OCC may determine that the continuation by a savings institution of its ownership, control of, or its relationship to, the subsidiary constitutes a serious risk to the safety, soundness or stability of the savings institution or is inconsistent with sound banking practices or with the purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Based upon that determination, the FDIC or the OCC has the authority to order the savings institution to divest itself of control of the subsidiary. The FDIC also may determine by regulation or order that any specific activity poses a serious threat to the DIF. If so, it may require that no DIF member engage in that activity directly. 

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. &#32;The Bank&#8217;s authority to engage in transactions with &#8220;affiliates&#8221; is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act as implemented by the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s Regulation W. The term &#8220;affiliates&#8221; for these purposes generally means any company that controls or is under common control with an institution. The Corporation and its non-savings institution subsidiaries are affiliates of the Bank. In general, transactions with affiliates must be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, certain types of transactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the institution&#8217;s capital. Collateral in specified amounts must be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from an institution. In addition, savings institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary. Federally insured savings institutions are subject, with certain exceptions, to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to their parent holding companies or other affiliates, on investments in the stock or other securities of affiliates and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral from any borrower. In addition, these institutions are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or the providing of any property or service. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#8221;) generally prohibits the Corporation from making loans to its executive officers and directors. However, that act contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors, if the lending is in compliance with federal banking laws. Under such laws, the Bank&#8217;s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders (&#8220;insiders&#8221;), as well as entities which such persons control, is limited. The law restricts both the individual and aggregate amount of loans the Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on the Bank&#8217;s capital position and requires certain Board approval procedures to be followed. Such loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. There are additional restrictions applicable to loans to executive officers. 

Community Reinvestment Act and Consumer Protection Laws. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, every FDIC-insured institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound banking practices to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The Community Reinvestment Act does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act requires the OCC, in connection with the examination of the Bank, to assess the institution&#8217;s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications, such as a merger or the establishment of a branch, by the Bank. The OCC may use an unsatisfactory rating as the basis for the denial of an application. Due to the heightened attention being given to the Community Reinvestment Act in the past few years, the Bank may be required to devote additional funds for investment and lending in its local community. The Bank received a rating of satisfactory when it was last examined for Community Reinvestment Act compliance. 

In connection with its deposit-taking, lending and other activities, the Bank is subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect consumers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. The CFPB issues regulations and standards under these federal consumer protection laws, which include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Through its rulemaking authority, the CFPB has promulgated several proposed and final regulations under these laws that will affect our consumer businesses. Among these regulatory initiatives, are final regulations setting &#8220;ability to repay&#8221; and &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; standards for residential mortgage loans and establishing new mortgage loan servicing and loan originator compensation standards. The Bank is evaluating these recent CFPB regulations and proposals and devotes substantial compliance, legal and operational business resources to ensure compliance with these consumer protection standards. In addition, the OCC has enacted customer privacy regulations that limit the ability of the Bank to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third parties. The regulations require disclosure of privacy policies and allow consumers to prevent certain personal information from being shared with non-affiliated parties. 

Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Laws . The &#32; Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act of 2001. These laws and regulations require the Bank to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their 

customers. Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, provisions of the USA Patriot Act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution's anti-money laundering activities when reviewing mergers and acquisitions. 

Regulatory and Criminal Enforcement Provisions. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federally chartered savings institutions and has the authority to bring action against all &#8220;institution-affiliated parties,&#8221; including stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease-and-desist order to removal of officers or directors, receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to $25,000 per day, or $1.1 million per day in especially egregious cases. The FDIC has the authority to recommend to the OCC that an enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution. If the OCC does not take action, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain circumstances. Federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations. 

Environmental Issues Associated with Real Estate Lending. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), a federal statute, generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present "owners and operators" of sites containing hazardous waste. However, Congress acted to protect secured creditors by providing that the term "owner and operator" excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this &#8220;secured creditor exemption&#8221; has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan. 

To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including the Bank, that have made loans secured by properties with potential hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs, which costs often substantially exceed the value of the collateral property. 

Other Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations. The Bank is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers. While the list set forth below is not exhaustive, these include the GLBA, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (more commonly known as the USA Patriot Act), the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfers Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages, and the loss of certain contractual rights. 

Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulations 

General. As a unitary savings and loan holding company, the Corporation is subject to the regulatory oversight of the Federal Reserve Board. Accordingly, the Corporation is required to register and file reports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over the Corporation and its non-savings institution subsidiaries, which also permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to present a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking regulators must require any company that controls an FDIC-insured depository institution to serve as a source of strength for the institution, with the ability to provide financial assistance if the institution suffers financial distress. These and other Federal Reserve Board policies may restrict the Corporation&#8217;s ability to pay dividends. 

Capital Requirements. &#32;&#32;Savings and loan holding companies historically have not been subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. However, in July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board approved a new rule that implements the &#8220;Basel III&#8221; regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, the Corporation is subject to regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, which generally are the same as the capital requirements for the Bank. These capital requirements include provisions that might impact the ability of the Corporation to pay dividends to its stockholders or 

repurchase its shares. For a description of the capital regulations, see &#8220;Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions - Capital Requirements&#8221; above. 

Activities Restrictions. The GLBA provides that no company may acquire control of a savings association after May 4, 1999 unless it engages only in the financial activities permitted for financial holding companies under the law or for multiple savings and loan holding companies as described below. The GLBA also specifies, subject to a grandfather provision, that existing savings and loan holding companies may only engage in such activities. The Corporation qualifies for the grandfathering and is therefore not restricted in terms of its activities. Upon any non-supervisory acquisition of another savings association as a separate subsidiary, the Corporation would become a multiple savings and loan holding company and would be limited to those activities permitted multiple savings and loan holding companies by Federal Reserve Board regulation. Multiple savings and loan holding companies may engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies, and certain other activities including acting as a trustee under a deed of trust and real estate investments. 

If the Bank fails the QTL test, the Corporation must, within one year of that failure, register as, and will become subject to the restrictions applicable to bank holding companies. For additional information, see &#8220;Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions &#8211; Qualified Thrift Lender Test&#8221; in this Form 10-K. 

Mergers and Acquisitions. The Corporation must obtain approval from the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company or acquiring such an institution or holding company by merger, consolidation or purchase of its assets. In evaluating an application for the Corporation to acquire control of a savings institution, the Federal Reserve Board would consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the Corporation and the target institution, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the DIF, the convenience and the needs of the community and competitive factors. 

The Federal Reserve Board may not approve any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions; (i) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies and (ii) the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the states of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions. 

Acquisition of the Company. Any company, except a bank holding company, that acquires control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company becomes a &#8220;savings and loan holding company&#8221; subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve and must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve under the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act before obtaining control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company. A bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act before obtaining control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company and remains subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act. The term &#8220;company&#8221; includes corporations, partnerships, associations, and certain trusts and other entities. &#8220;Control&#8221; of a savings association or savings and loan holding company is deemed to exist if a company has voting control, directly or indirectly of more than 25% of any class of the savings association&#8217;s voting stock or controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the savings association or savings and loan holding company, and may be presumed under other circumstances, including, but not limited to, holding 10% or more of a class of voting securities if the institution has a class of registered securities, as the Corporation has. Control may be direct or indirect and may occur through acting in concert with one or more other persons. In addition, a savings and loan holding company must obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to acquiring voting control of more than 5% of any class of voting stock of another savings association or another savings association holding company. A similar provision limiting the acquisition by a bank holding company of 5% or more of a class of voting stock of any company is included in the Bank Holding Company Act. 

Accordingly, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board would be required: 

&#8226; 

before any savings and loan holding company or bank holding company could acquire 5% or more of the common stock of the Corporation; and 

&#8226; 

before any other company could acquire 25% or more of the common stock of the Corporation, and may be required for an acquisition of as little as 10% of such stock. 

In addition, persons that are not companies are subject to the same or similar definitions of control with respect to savings and loan holding companies and savings associations and requirements for prior regulatory approval by the Federal Reserve in the case of control of a savings and loan holding company or by the OCC in the case of control of a savings association not obtained through control of a holding company of such savings association. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was enacted in 2002 in response to public concerns regarding corporate accountability in connection with certain accounting scandals. The stated goals of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act were to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally applies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the SEC, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including the Corporation. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act includes very specific additional disclosure requirements and corporate governance rules, requires the SEC and securities exchanges to adopt extensive additional disclosures, corporate governance and related rules and mandates. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees. As noted above, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes additional disclosure and corporate government requirements and represents further federal involvement in matters historically addressed by state corporate law. 

Dividends and Stock Repurchases. The Federal Reserve policy statement on the payment of cash dividends applicable to savings and loan holding companies provides that although there are no specific regulations restricting dividend payments other than state corporate laws, a savings and loan holding company must maintain an adequate capital position and generally should not pay cash dividends unless the company&#8217;s net income for the past year is sufficient to fully fund the cash dividends and that the prospective rate of earnings appears consistent with the company&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve policy statement also indicates that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. In addition, a savings and loan holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months, is equal to 10% or more of its consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010: &#32;&#32;On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank-Act imposes new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions and implements capital regulations that were discussed above under &#8220;Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions - Capital Requirements." In addition, among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies, such as the Corporation, to (i) provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote (a) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers and (b) at least once every six years on whether they should have a &#8220;say on pay&#8221; vote every one, two or three years; (ii) have a separate, non-binding shareholder vote regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments; (iii) provide disclosure in annual proxy materials concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer; and (iv) amend Item 402 of Regulation S-K to require companies to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. For certain of these changes, the implementing regulations have not been promulgated, so the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on public companies cannot be determined at this time. 

TAXATION 

Federal Taxation 

General. The Corporation and the Bank report their income on a fiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly the Bank&#8217;s reserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Bank or the Corporation. 

Tax Bad Debt Reserves. As a result of legislation enacted in 1996, the reserve method of accounting for bad debt reserves was repealed for tax years beginning after December 31, 1995. Due to such repeal, the Bank is no longer able to calculate its deduction for bad debts using the percentage-of-taxable-income or the experience method. Instead, the Bank is permitted to deduct as bad debt expense its specific charge-offs during the taxable year. In addition, the legislation required savings institutions to recapture 

into taxable income, over a six-year period, their post 1987 additions to their bad debt tax reserves. As of the effective date of the legislation, the Bank had no post 1987 additions to its bad debt tax reserves. As of June 30, 2016, the Bank&#8217;s total pre-1988 bad debt reserve for tax purposes was approximately $9.0 million. Under current law, a savings institution will not be required to recapture its pre-1988 bad debt reserve unless the Bank makes a &#8220;non-dividend distribution&#8221; as defined below. Currently, the Corporation uses the specific charge-off method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax purposes. 

&#160; 

Distributions . In the event that the Bank makes &#8220;non-dividend distributions&#8221; to the Corporation that are considered as made from the reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans, to the extent the reserve for such losses exceeds the amount that would have been allowed under the experience method or from the supplemental reserve for losses on loans (&#8220;Excess Distributions&#8221;), then an amount based on the amount distributed will be included in the Bank&#8217;s taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the Bank&#8217;s current and accumulated earnings and profits, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. However, dividends paid out of the Bank&#8217;s current or accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, will not be considered to result in a distribution from the Bank&#8217;s bad debt reserve. Thus, any dividends to the Corporation that would reduce amounts appropriated to the Bank&#8217;s bad debt reserve and deducted for federal income tax purposes would create a tax liability for the Bank. The amount of additional taxable income attributable to an Excess Distribution is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Thus, if the Bank makes a &#8220;non-dividend distribution,&#8221; then approximately one and one-half times the amount distributed will be included in taxable income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 35% corporate income tax rate (exclusive of state and local taxes). For additional information, see "Regulation - Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions - Limitations on Capital Distributions&#8221; in this Form 10-K for limits on the payment of dividends by the Bank. The Bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its tax bad debt reserve. During fiscal 2016, the Bank declared and paid $15.0 million of cash dividends to the Corporation while the Corporation declared and paid $4.0 million of cash dividends to shareholders. 

Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. The Code imposes a tax on alternative minimum taxable income (&#8220;AMTI&#8221;) at a rate of 20%. In addition, only 90% of AMTI can be offset by net operating loss carryovers. AMTI is increased by an amount equal to 75% of the amount by which the Corporation&#8217;s adjusted current earnings exceeds its AMTI (determined without regard to this preference and prior to reduction for net operating losses). 

Tax Effect from Stock-Based Compensation. During fiscal 2016, there were no shares of restricted common stock distributed to non-employee members of the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors. There were 10,000 shares of restricted common stock distributed to employees, 7,500 non-qualified stock options that expired and 74,500 non-qualified stock options exercised as to purchase shares of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock during fiscal 2016. As a result, there was a $169,000 federal tax benefit effect from stock-based compensation in fiscal 2016. 

Other Matters. The Internal Revenue Service has audited the Bank&#8217;s income tax returns through 1996 and the California Franchise Tax Board has audited the Bank through 1990. Also, the Internal Revenue Service completed a review of the Corporation&#8217;s income tax returns for fiscal 2006 and 2007; and the California Franchise Tax Board completed a review of the Corporation&#8217;s income tax returns for fiscal 2009 and 2010. Tax fiscal years 2013 and forward remain subject to federal examination, while the California state tax returns for fiscal years 2012 and forward are subject to examination by state taxing authorities. 

&#160; 

State Taxation 

California. The California franchise tax rate applicable to the Bank, equals the franchise tax rate applicable to corporations generally, plus an &#8220;in lieu&#8221; rate of 2%, which is approximately equal to personal property taxes and business license taxes paid by such corporations (but not generally paid by banks or financial corporations such as the Bank). At June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Corporation&#8217;s net state tax rate was 7.0% and 7.3%, respectively. Bad debt deductions are available in computing California franchise taxes using the specific charge-off method. The Bank and its California subsidiaries file California franchise tax returns on a combined basis. The Corporation will be treated as a general corporation subject to the general corporate tax rate. There was a $53,000 state tax benefit effect from stock-based compensation in fiscal 2016, as described above in the section entitled "Federal Taxation." 

Delaware. As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, the Corporation is exempted from Delaware corporate income tax, but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Corporation paid annual franchise taxes of $180,000 for each year.
