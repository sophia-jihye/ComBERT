Our Company was formed by a core group of executives who have held senior level positions with several of the largest companies in the entertainment and marketing management industry. Our Company delivers customized marketing solutions at optimize profitability by concentrating our resources in those segments of the marketing communications and entertainment industry. Our Company operates in the sectors of experiential marketing, event marketing, commercial rights, and talent management. 

&#160;

We also offer branding and design services, including graphic, industrial and package designs across traditional and new media, public relations, social media, media development and relations and interactive marketing platforms to provide our clients with a customary private digital media networks to design and develop individual broadcasting digital media channels for our clients to sell, promote and enhance their digital media video contents through mobile, online and social mediums. 

&#160;

Below is the business description of XA, The Experiential Agency, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

XA, The Experiential Agency, Inc. &#160; (&#8220;XA&#8221;) 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160; 

XA, The Experiential Agency, Inc. (&#8220;XA&#8221;) is the Company&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary engaged in event marketing and management. XA was acquired by the Company on April 1, 2009. It engages in a diverse range of marketing services, including interactive event strategy and planning, creative development, public relations, and nontraditional marketing. XA has staged movie and show premiers, cross country tours, hosted VIP events, staged press stunts, and other types of media events and services for leading shows, production houses, non profit agencies and local communities across the United States. In addition to the physical event planning, logistics and event implementation, XA also engages in the interactive side of the events to increase branding awareness over the Internet. 

&#160;

XA&#8217;s strong competitive advantage are (i) its long term presence and it is in its 25th year as a successful top tier event marketing agency, (ii) its outstanding long term vendor relationships that help deliver exceptional programs to its clients, and (iii) &#160; the vertical integration that gives its clients a single source for all their event marketing needs, which we believe will require less outsourcing and increased profitability and delivering superior customer service and creates one of a kind events and programs. 

&#160;

Business Model 

&#160;

Rooted in brand creativity and client partnerships, XA maintains unique client relationships by anticipating client challenges and providing innovative solutions. The XA business model is taking strategic marketing programs to new levels of audience experience through alternative advertising and experiential marketing and interactive media solutions. The XA marketing capabilities enable their clients and audience to &#8220;experience&#8221; events compared to just hearing or seeing their client&#8217;s messages through holistic experiences to boost sales and increase brand awareness and customer affinity. 

&#160;

While XA continues to seek opportunities and win projects from Fortune 100 clients in the larger enterprise segment, we believe that rapid revenue growth opportunities and margin improvements are available in the comprehensive advisory services of the small to medium enterprise (SME) segment. The SME market has many smaller firms that specialize in only a few aspects of the event marketing and business communications segments, yet SME&#8217;s face equally important challenges in terms of brand building and content management. By acting as a comprehensive integrated single source for the total marketing needs of the SMEs, XA has created a niche for itself on a national scale and will replicate the same success strategy internationally under the Company&#8217;s holding company model. Given the fact that brand marketers are demanding a full service agency for developing and executing integrated marketing campaigns, we believes that XA will take advantage of the accelerating secular trend of shifts in corporate emphasis toward online event/promotional marketing versus traditional media driven selling efforts. XA is specifically focused on strategically target key segments within the event marketing space in order to capture market share in its existing geographic locations as well as enhance its national and international presence. XA is positioning itself as the one of the few source marketing partners in the market with its unique selling point being the ability to act as a source for the client&#8217;s total marketing needs. This would encompass the entire spectrum of services associated with marketing, from strategizing and defining an event portfolio, conceptualization of the event theme and content creation to the final implementation/management of events. XA will also provide an ultimate client return on investment assessment following each implementation. 

&#160;

Market Strategy 

&#160;

We have taken strategic steps to position the Company as a marketing communications company servicing clients in domestic and international markets. We operate in a marketing landscape that has vastly changed over the last few years and continues to fragment as clients are presented with different complex strategies to improve brand awareness and increase market share. To achieve our objectives of providing strategic solutions for our clients, we have recruited talents and have concentrated in high&#173; growth areas to align our capabilities to meet the market demands. In order to grow with our clients, we have accelerated our investment in technologies, professional talent, and provided training throughout our Company. Our market strategy and offerings can improve our organic revenue growth and operating income margin, with our ultimate objective to be fully competitive with our industry peer groups. To increase our revenues and improve our operating margins, we will concentrate on controlling our staff expenses in non revenue producing capacities, controlling real estate expenses such as office rent, reducing the complexity of our organization and divesting of underperforming business sectors. 

&#160; 

Through our wholly owned subsidiary, XA, an integrated experiential marketing services company, we develop, manage and execute sales promotion programs at both national and local levels, utilizing both online and offline marketing programs. Our programs assist our clients effectively and promote their platforms and services directly to retailers and consumers, and are intended to assist our clients to achieve maximum impact and return on their marketing investment. Our activities reinforce brand awareness, provide incentives to retailers to motivate consumers to purchase their products, and are designed to meet the needs of our clients by focusing on the communities who want to engage brands as part of their lifestyles. 

&#160;

Sources of Revenue 

&#160;

Our revenues are generated through the execution of marketing and communications programs derived primarily across the sectors of event management, talent management and commercial rights as well as various media, planning and other management programs. The majority of our contracts with our clients are negotiated individually and the terms of engagement with our clients and basis in which we earn fees and commissions will vary significantly. Contracts with our client are multifaceted arrangements that may include incentive compensation provisions and may include vendor credits. Our largest clients are corporations where they may arrange for our services to be provided locally or nationally. Similar to larger marketing communications companies operating in our sector, our revenues are primarily derived from planning and executing marketing and communications programs in various operating sectors. Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated where terms of engagements and consideration in which we earn revenues vary among planning, creation, implementation and executions of marketing and communications programs specific to the sectors of talent management, event management, and commercial rights. Several of our clients have complex contract arrangements&#894; therefore, we provide services to our clients from our own offices as well as onsite where the events are held. In arranging for such services, we may enter into national or local agreements and estimates are involved in determining both amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our fees are calculated to reflect our expertise based on monthly rates as well as mark up percentages and the relative overhead expenses to execute services provided to our clients. Clients may seek to include incentive compensation components for successful execution as part of the total compensation. Commissions earned are based on services provided and are usually calculated on a percentage over the total revenues generated for our clients. Our revenues can also be generated when clients pay gross rates before we pay reduced rates&#8212;the difference is commissions earned which is either retained in total or shared with the client depending on the nature of the services agreement. Our generated revenues are dependent upon the marketing and communications requirements of our corporate clients and dependent on the terms of the client contract. The revenues for services performed can be recognized as proportional performance, monthly basis or execution of the completed contracts. For revenues recognized on a completed contract basis, the contract terms are customary in the industry. Our client contracts generally provide terms for termination by either party on 90 day notice. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

In the highly competitive and fragmented marketing and communications industry, our Company competes for business with mid size marketing firms such as Mktg, Inc. as well as large global holding companies such as International Management Group, Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., MDC Partners, Inc. and Omnicom. These global companies generally have greater resources than those available to us, and such resources may enable them to aggressively compete with our Company&#8217;s marketing communications businesses. We also face competition from numerous independent agencies that operate in multiple markets. Our competitive advantage is to provide clients with marketing strategies that are focused on increasing clients&#8217; revenues and profits. 

&#160;

Industry Trend 

&#160;

Historically, event management and talent management have been primary service provided by global companies in the marketing communications industry. However, as clients aim to establish individual and enhanced relationships with their customers to more accurately measure the effectiveness of their marketing expenditures, specialized and digital communications services are consuming a growing portion of marketing dollars. This increases the demand for a broader range of marketing communications services. The mass market audience is giving way to life style segments, social events/networks, and online/mobile communities, with each segment requiring a different message and/or different, often non traditional, channels of communication. Global marketers now seek innovative strategies, concepts and programs for new opportunities for small to mid sized communications companies. 

&#160;

Clients 

&#160;

The Company serves clients across the marketing communication industry. Marketing agreements and talent representation for our clients means that the Company handles marketing communications and multiple brands, product lines of the client in every geographical location. We have contracts with many of our clients and the terms of the contracts are customary in the industry. These contracts provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8212; Executive Overview&#8221; for a further discussion of our arrangements with our clients. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the Company and its subsidiary had 8 employees. The personal service character of the marketing communications sector, the quality of personnel and executive management are crucially important to the Company&#8217;s continuing success. 

&#160;

Environmental Laws 

&#160;

The company believes it complies with all regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, and such regulations have not had a material effect on the capital expenditures or operations of the company. 

&#160;

Recent Acquisition of Good Gaming 

&#160;

On March 28, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of Good Gaming, Inc. (&#8220;GGI&#8221;) by entering into a Share Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;SEA&#8221;) with BMB Financial, Inc. and Jackie Beckford, GGI&#8217;s shareholders. The owner of BMB Financial, Inc. is also the owner of Infinite Alpha, Inc. which provides consulting services to CMG. Pursuant to the SEA, for 100% of the shares of GGI, CMG paid: 5,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, $33,000 in equipment and consultant compensation and a commitment to pay $200,000 in development costs, of which $50,000 had been advanced by CMG. In addition, the SEA calls for CMG to adopt an incentive plan for GGI pursuant to which the GGI&#8217;s officers, directors and employees will receive up to 30% of the net profits of GGI and up to 30% of the proceeds of any sale of GGI or its assets. In November of 2015 the Company entered into an agreement to sell Good GFaming. The Sale closed in February of 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The SEA contains representations and warranties from the former GGI shareholders customary for this type of transaction. 

&#160;

GGI is an online gaming portal with a business objective of assisting eSports gamers to hone and elevate their skills so as to enable them to compete at a higher level in amateur thru professional gaming tournaments. GGI plans to provide its targeted market with access to its proprietary membership based eSports web platform. GGI intends to provide a service with a monthly membership fee to its target market comprised of 16&#173;25 year old, single, high school/college level adults with disposable income and more than 10 hours of invested game play weekly. 

&#160;

GGI plans to offer a multiple array of incentive driven tournaments to meet the needs of a varied gaming community. GGI plans to hold signature level season tournament play on a quarterly basis. GGI intends to offer many regularly scheduled tournaments on a weekly and monthly basis which will offer cash and other incentive based prizes. GGI also intends to offer organizational level tournaments for groups of gamers who organize themselves in guilds/teams/clans/parties etc. As GGI grows, it intends to offer community driven tournaments that are structured by gamers and organized groups in which they will determine the prizes, style and nature of the incentives. 

&#160;

GGI intends to produce gaming content that is regularly updated by experienced gamers. This content will cover hundreds of areas, some of which are: gaming skills, macros, play style, nomenclature, terminology, tricks and tips, items, equipment, survival, balance of power and etiquette. This content will be focused on improving the gaming experience while improving the overall skill level of casual and serious gamers. In addition, the content will provide a teaching base to assist gamers achieve higher levels of competitive play with the intent to develop the right candidates for professional level play. 

&#160;

GGI plans to introduce a proprietary matchmaking system code named &#8220;Mercenary&#8221; that GGI believes can greatly improve upon the linear &#8220;ranking&#8221; style currently in place in most eSports and competitive games. Mercenary can enable gamers to locate players that not only play at or near their skill level but also their play style and &#8220;comp&#8221;. Mercenary can also harness the power of community based knowledge to offer a continuing improved gaming experience. Mercenary, as it grows, will teach players so that their strengths and weaknesses do not need to rely solely upon a dubious quantitative value that is left for the gamer to decipher. GGI is planning to make Mercenary applicable across multiple games and platforms to quickly allow matchmaking to occur in the adoption of new games and new content. 

&#160;

GGI plans to actively pursue game designers, publishers, and content providers seeking partnerships and agreements that can produce a win win scenario for gamers and providers. These agreements will focus on securing exclusive game content for the purpose of improving the GGI community and offering unique content and experiences. GGI plans to offer providers access to a unique demographic of gamers at their disposal for alpha testing, beta testing, feedback, non traditional gaming exposure, and test content. GGI plans to attempt to foster a cross platform/game concept to consolidate merchandising, pay to play, aesthetic, and advertising content in a cohesive collective. This collective can create unique and new ways for gamers and providers to achieve goals that currently do not exist or are not robust enough to meet the larger needs of the gaming and advertising community. 

&#160;

GGI&#8217;s overall goals are to be the one stop internet presence for serious gamers who wish to move beyond the casual gaming moniker and compete in eSports. GGI plans to improve the overall gamers experience through improving their game etiquette, skill set, and mastery techniques suited to higher professional play. GGI while serving the gaming community has the overall desire to close the gap between gamers, providers, advertisers to foster a gaming community that results in a fun, satisfying experience while serving an economic purpose. 

&#160;

GGI currently has five employees, each of whom is involved in the development of its eSports web portal. 

&#160;

CMG believes that GGI currently does not have any direct competition. However, GGI has a number of indirect competitors which offer eSports content and information related to competitive gaming focused around specific game titles or consoles. These indirect competitors include: Skill Capped, Major League Gaming, Curse, MMO Champion, LOL King and MOBAfire. 

&#160;

AudioEye Separation and Spin off 

&#160;

On March 23, 2010 the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with the former stockholders of AudioEye, Inc. (hereinafter &#8220;AE&#8221;) whereby AE became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the former stockholders of AE retained rights (the &#8220;Rights&#8221;) to receive cash from the exploitation of AE&#8217;s technology. These Rights consisted of 50% of any cash received from income earned, settlements or judgments directly resulting from AE&#8217;s patent strategy, net of any direct costs or tax implications incurred in payment of the patent strategy. Additionally, the holders of the Rights were entitled to a share of AE&#8217;s net income for 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 based on a specified formula. The holders of the Rights have contributed the Rights to AEAC in exchange for shares of AEAC. The Company also had issued Senior Secured Notes (the &#8220;AE Notes&#8221;) in an aggregate principal amount of $1,075,000 to such former shareholders of AE, which were secured by all of the assets of the Company, including AE. There was a significant risk that unless the AE Notes were kept current and serviced, the holders of the AE Notes would foreclose and take possession of AE or its assets. 

&#160; 

On June 22, 2011, the Company entered into a Master Agreement (the &#8220;Master Agreement&#8221;) with AudioEye Acquisition Corporation (&#8220;AEAC&#8221;) pursuant to which: (i) the stockholders of AEAC would acquire from the Company 80% of the capital stock of AE (the &#8220;Separation&#8221;) and (ii) the Company distributed to its stockholders, in the form of a dividend, 5% of the capital stock of AE (the &#8220;Spin off&#8221;). Pursuant to the Master Agreement, as amended, AEAC also released the Company from its obligations under the AE Notes. In connection with the release of the Company under the AE Notes, effective August 15, 2012, the Company completed the Separation. On February 22, 2013, the Company completed the Spin off by distributing a total of 1,500,259 shares of AE common stock to its shareholders on the record date of October 26, 2012 on a pro rata basis after the SEC declared the registration statement on Form S&#173;1 filed by AE effective on January 19, 2013. As a result of the foregoing transactions, the Company retained a total of 4,500,874 shares of AE common stock. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Also in connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a Royalty Agreement with AE, pursuant to which for a period of five years, AE would pay to the Company 10% of cash received from income earned or settlements on judgments directly resulting from AE&#8217;s patent enforcement and licensing strategy, whether received by AE or any of AE&#8217;s affiliates, net in either case of any direct costs or tax implications incurred in pursuit of such strategy as they relate to the patents described in the Master Agreement. Additionally, the Company entered into a Services Agreement with AE whereby, without duplication to the amounts payable under the Royalty Agreement, for a period of 5 years, the Company shall receive a commission of 7.5% of all revenues received by AE after the Separation from all business, clients or other sources of revenue procured by the Company or its employees, officers or subsidiaries and directed to AE and 10% of net revenues obtained from a specified customer. 

&#160; 

On August 1, 2013, the Company and AE entered into a Call Option Agreement (&#8220;AE Call Option&#8221;), where the Company granted AE the rights to purchase from AE up to 4,500,874 shares of AE common stock that the Company held. The AE Call Option was amended later on August 30, 2013, September 14, 2013, November 7, 2013 and November 25, 2013 and December 16, 2013, where the option granted under the AE Call Option was amended to reflect the new exercise price and the extended expiration date of March 31, 2014. 

&#160;

In addition, pursuant to the AE Call Option, on November 12, 2013, the Company agreed to terminate the Royalty Agreement in consideration for cash payment of $85,000 from AE. 

&#160; 

On December 30, 2013, AE repurchased from the Company a total of 2,184,583 shares of AE common stock owned by the Company for the following consideration: (i) cash payment of $573,022 and (ii) release of Good Gaming, Inc.&#8217;s obligation to AE in connection with a $50,000 accounts payable.

Recent Developments 

&#160;

Good Gaming Acquisition 

&#160;

On March 28, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of Good Gaming, Inc. (&#8220;GGI&#8221;) by entering into a Share Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;SEA&#8221;) with BMB Financial, Inc. and Jackie Beckford, GGI&#8217;s shareholders. The owner of BMB Financial, Inc. is also the owner of Infinite Alpha, Inc. which provides consulting services to CMG. Pursuant to the SEA, for 100% of the shares of GGI, CMG paid: 5,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, $33,000 in equipment and consultant compensation and a commitment to pay $200,000 in development costs, of which $50,000 had been advanced by CMG. In addition, the SEA calls for CMG to adopt an incentive plan for GGI pursuant to which the GGI&#8217;s officers, directors and employees will receive up to 30% of the net profits of GGI and up to 30% of the proceeds of any sale of GGI or its assets. 

&#160;

GGI&#8217;s field team has acquired new independently confirmable research showing eSports and competitive gaming is growing at a much faster pace than anticipated. According to Newwzoo BV games market research, eSports viewership is more than doubling on a year over year basis and we have seen that prize pools are increasing even faster in many cases. With the announcement that Wargaming&#8217;s signature title "World of Tanks" will invest $10 million into eSports, GGI believes that other companies aside from industry leaders Riot games, Valve, and Ubisoft, are likely to enter the million dollar investment pool as the stakes for eSports grows. As a result, large advertisers are starting to focus on the eSports industry as it offers a platform for reaching increasing numbers of consumers. 

Some key statistics that drive our growing optimistic outlook are as follows: 

&#160;

- &#160; Over 20% of eSports gamers are big spender&#8217;s vs 8% for all gamers. 

- 

Over 90% of eSports gamers spend money on games vs 65% for all gamers. 

&#160;

- 

The global games market is a $74 billion market and eSports is one of the fastest growing segments 

&#160;

- &#160; For the first time, in 2013 Chinese giant Tencent surpassed Activision blizzard in gaming revenues solidifying the diminishing need for large box game development and loosening dependence on Christmas holiday sales patterns. 

&#160;

&#160; Newzoo BV, Q4 PC Gaming Trend Report 2013 Report and Q2 Sizing Profiling eSports 2014 Report. 

&#160;

GGI is in the process of researching what it is that gamers want &#173; what their goals, aspirations, and ideas of euphoria tend to be. As of the beginning of 2014, according to Newzoo BV, 163.9 million people in the world, 15.38% of them in the United States, are playing video games often enough for it to be a full time job. We believe that eSports is not just a growing segment within the gaming industry, but within the much larger entertainment industry. It is not restricted by nationality, political affiliation, or socioeconomic status. eSports principal barrier is a simple one &#8211; internet access. 

&#160;

Behind the development of GGI&#8217;s web platform, GGI is seeking to access the gaming community. GGI has been seeking and has already signed veteran talent in the gaming community and is broadening its network of veteran and pro players. 

&#160;

GGI recently established a partnership with a leading 3 rd party provider of an eSports tournament management system. This partnership will provide a crucial backbone infrastructure for GGI&#8217;s proprietary tournament design and has done so at less than 1/10 th &#160; the cost originally expected due to diligent work by GGI&#8217;s IT development team and the innovation of its partner. 

&#160;

GGI anticipates that it will be able to announce key publisher partnerships and agreements in the coming months that can place it near the top of eSports entertainment and solidify its projected membership base. 

In April of 2014 CMG was approached by a group interested in spinning off Good Gaming from CMG. The LOI indicated that CMG would maintain a majority interest in the Company. Good Gaming would be listed on the Canadian Stock Exchange. In addition there would be a minimum of a $500,000 infusion of capital to the Company. Discussions are ongoing but there is no certainty that a deal will be consummated. Parties are involved in doing due diligence currently. 

&#160; 

During the quarters ended June 30, 2014 and September 30, 2014, each of the employees in XA&#8217;s New York office, as well as its COO in Chicago resigned. The Company later learned that each of these employees had, along with XA&#8217;s former CEO, formed a new company, called Hudson Gray, LLC (&#8220;HG&#8221;) which was soliciting XA&#8217;s clients using confidential and proprietary information gained from their employment with XA. 

&#160; 

On September 23, 2014, XA filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York against HG and its principals alleging wrongdoing by the defendants in connection with soliciting XA&#8217;s clients and seeking against further contact with XA clients. The Company conducted an internal investigation of actions taken by XA&#8217;s former employees during the quarter ended September 30, 2014.. The Company and XA plan to complete the investigation, including recovering e-mails deleted by the former employees, and to vigorously pursue any and all amounts wrongfully taken from XA. 

&#160; 

The investigation has been completed, an amended complaint will be filed on June 15, 2015. New counsel has been retained to pursue the prosecution of the case and the new counsels name is Laurence Steckman of the firm Eaton and Van Winkle. There will be new defendants added and the damages sought will be substantially increased
