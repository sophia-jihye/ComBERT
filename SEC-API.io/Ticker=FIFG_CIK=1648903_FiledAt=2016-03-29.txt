 Item 1. Business. 

&#160;

Litera Group, Inc. ("Litera," or the "Company") is currently an "emerging growth company" under the JOBS Act. A company loses its "emerging growth company" status on (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of its first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"); (iii) the date on which it has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which it is deemed to be a 'large accelerated filer', as defined in section 240.12b&#8211; 2 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto. As an "emerging growth company," Litera is exempt from certain obligations of the Exchange Act including those found in Section 14A(a) and (b) related to shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachute compensation and Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to the requirement that management assess the effectiveness of the company's internal control for financial reporting. Furthermore, Section 103 of the JOBS Act provides that as an "emerging growth company", Litera is not required to comply with the requirement to provide an auditor's attestation of ICFR under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for as long as Litera qualifies as an "emerging growth company." However, an "emerging growth company" is not exempt from the requirement to perform management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting.

&#160;

Litera was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 1, 2015. We were formed for the purpose of providing products and services within the film and theater production industry. Our founder, Mr. Wade Gardner, was appointed CEO, President, Secretary, CFO, Treasurer and Director of the Company. The Board voted to seek capital to carry out our business plan. We received our initial funding of $20,100 through the sale of common stock to Mr. Gardner who purchased 10,500,000 shares of our Common Stock on June 5, 2015. Our principal executive offices are located at 5751 Buckingham Pkwy, Culver City, CA 90230, our telephone number is (424) 543-4066 and our fax number is (424) 543-5072.

&#160;

Litera is a developmental stage corporation that is dedicated to the creation and commercialization of literary and dramatic products and services with the aim of achieving profitability and sustaining growth of our business. Our implemented plan of operation is the development of screenplays, stage plays, comedy sketch and skit scripts, short film scripts and other literary and dramatic works, as well as offer abridgment and adaptation services, within the theater and film production community. 

&#160;

The key to our success lies in the Company's ability to identify a niche in the entertainment production market and fill the unsatisfied demand. Litera will target independent film and theatrical producers and small and experimental production studios that constantly scout for fresh entertainment material to produce and distribute. To save time and money, indie producers and small studios do not outlay expenses associated with creation of a literary or dramatic work, but instead procure completed aspiring projects to produce or distribute from others. This is the market niche that Litera has focused on. 

&#160;

Since our inception, we have commenced our business operations, including developing products, preliminary marketing of the completed work, as well as closing the first ten sales of our projects for an aggregate of $24,500. The Company also has three more finished products available for sale, as well as two more projects in advanced development status. We negotiate contract details for our products and services as an option or an outright sale basis. Currently, the Company secured all the resources and skills needed to create and market our products and services internally by utilizing our sole officer and director's creative writing abilities and his background within the film and theater entertainment. In the future, Litera may pursue additional avenues outside its own walls and look to outsource certain aspects of services and product development and engage playwrights/screenwriters for this purpose. We anticipate that, as the Company grows over the next twelve months, pools of expertise will be acquired by recruiting within the film and theater production industry and by the use of creative and marketing consultants, which will allow Litera to expand its management team and add to the Board of Directors.

&#160;

As an emerging company, we continually analyze our business plan and operations in the light of current trends within the theater and film entertainment, market conditions and developments. We intend to become a self-sustained operational entity. In order to generate revenues, the management will aim to maximize the Company's business value by creating competitive products and services, addressing market and competition, utilizing specific marketing strategies, and establishing growth strategy for our company.

&#160;

OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

&#160;

The Company develops literary and dramatic works such as screenplays, stage plays, comedy sketch and skit scripts, short film scripts, etc. for theater/film production. On our clients' request we will also provide abridgment and adaptation services on any products they are interested in. Abridgment is a condensing of a creative work into a shorter form while maintaining the unity of the original. Adaptation is conversion of an original work to another genre or medium (e.g. a short film script into a stage play, etc.)

&#160;

The process for creating a literary or dramatic work can be an arduous one. For each project we conduct a needs assessment to determine the trends in certain categories of theater and film entertainment that enjoy popularity at the time. The theater and cinema culture is cyclical in nature; every once in a while a certain vision, topic or genre becomes popular, and producers release films and performances that adhere to this style or genre until the current interest and demand fizzle down. Other genres then take over and the process runs full cycle again. For purposes of demand and marketability, choosing a trend/genre that is currently on the edge of popularity is vital, and this is why a proper needs assessment is essential. We consider it the most important aspect of the entire process.

&#160;

Next, we determine the feasibility of making our product a success. We consider our product a success when it garnishes interest from prospective buyers and results in a sale or option contract. During our feasibility analysis we explore and analyze similar films and performances in a chosen category that were proven successful over time to identify the creative and commercial attributes that made them work in order to utilize them for our projects. 

&#160;

We then identify the audience who we intend to reach through our product. Knowing the audience is important because it determines the content that will appear in the writing, as it may vary greatly depending on the intended audience. Targeting the product at specific audience increases the chances of the product sparking interest from potential buyers, so we must determine the market we intend our product for and cater to this audience's expectations throughout our writing.

&#160;

Further, we move to concept development. We identify an idea or a story within a genre that is popular or gaining in popularity based on our needs assessment analysis. This is considered a product's early development where a story outline is created. Once the story outline takes shape, writing, or actual creative development, begins. It is the most time-consuming part of the process during which a workable script is crafted from a story outline. This crucial phase includes developing the format, narrative (plot, characters, story lines) and dialogue; introducing conflict, climax and resolution; writing out scene-by-scene physical interaction, utilizing symbolism, etc. The drafts are then rewritten and polished numerous times until we believe they are ready to be marketed for sale, at which time a logline and synopsis to convey both the content and the tone of the completed work are prepared for prospective clients' review and consideration. Litera makes sure to prepare these carefully thought out and compelling to engage and excite a prospective client about the potential of the project. 

&#160;

All phases of our product development, marketing and sales are conducted exclusively by Mr. Gardner, who devotes full time to the Company's operations. To-date, no capital has been expensed for development of our works. Litera develops products "on spec" (i.e. non-commissioned) and advertises them directly to our target market. Mr. Gardner uses his numerous industry contacts and studio introductions that he has developed over course of his career in entertainment business as the starting point in our clientele building. Depending on the complexity of the project, it takes Mr. Gardner about 2-6 weeks to produce a product ready for marketing.

TARGET MARKET AND OUR NICHE WITHIN

&#160;

It is essential for the Company's success to identify a niche in the entertainment market and fill the unsatisfied demand. To select a niche in the entertainment market that Litera could cater to, the Company researched core groups of professionals within the large demographic entertainment community who have similar needs and interests that could be targeted with excellent results. All the research data was derived from available industry and marketing information accumulated by our sole officer and director and required no expenses. We were able to establish that, having weathered financial storms in the past decade, the dynamics within the entertainment industry encountered changes which resulted in an acute shortage of development capital for new projects both in film and theater. While major studios and production companies maintain control of the high-end of the market and the big movies and shows, the independent film and theatrical producers have proven themselves to be more efficient making low budget films and theater shows. To save time and money, indie producers and small studios do not outlay expenses associated with creation of a literary or dramatic work, but instead procure completed aspiring projects to produce or distribute from others. Litera will target independent film and theatrical producers and small and experimental production studios that constantly scout for new exciting projects to produce and distribute. This is the market niche that Litera has selected and will focus on. 

&#160;

COMPETITION, OUR COMPETITIVE STRATEGY AND METHODS OF COMPETITION

&#160;

The film and theater production industry is highly competitive, and our Company faces competition ranging from large and well established film and theater production companies to thousands of small firms engaged in developing and producing play and screenplay options and other material in a similar manner as Litera and seeking to enter the industry.

&#160;

Our competitive strategy is based on the facts that while Litera is at a significant disadvantage to more established competitors due to our lack of financial resources, scarcity of relationships within the film and theater production community and absence of major marketing tools, the barriers to entry into the industry are nevertheless relatively low. It takes skills, knowledge and contacts to develop and sell products and services similar to ours. The Company believes that Mr. Gardner's pre-existing industry connections, his experience and background may allow us to tap into the theater and film production industry with a certain level of credibility. We will aim to produce creatively unique projects to gain the competitive edge we need while watching closely for emerging trends in theater and cinema and demands of the audience.

&#160;

The Company's primary method of competition is to market specifically to independent and experimental film makers and small theater production companies. To save time and money, indie producers and small studios do not outlay expenses associated with creation of a literary or dramatic work, and therefore, they rely on others to supply them with well-written material. We believe that since we have chosen this specific niche market, we will be able to target the right audience and cater to its demands.

&#160;

MARKETING, MARKETING OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES

&#160;

Litera markets its products and services directly to the theater and film production community, focusing specifically on independent film and theatrical producers and small and experimental production studios. 

&#160;

Our Marketing Objectives are as follows:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Establishing and promoting our presence in our selected targeted market

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Creating and maintaining a media list of theater and film entertainment PR agencies and advertising firms contacts

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Building a network of theater and film industry professional relationships and referrals

&#160;

&#160; 5 

&#160; 

&#160;

To promote and market our products and services, we may incorporate the following strategies: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Establishing online presence by designing a corporate website reflecting products and scope of services offered. We will also engage in a search engine optimization campaign to improve visibility of our website and assist us with awareness for our products and services. Optimizing a website may involve editing its content and HTML and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Approaching our industry target market by email. The most basic method of contacting is a carefully thought out query letter, sent via email, which consists of a one-paragraph synopsis of a project, a bio, a logline, in standard business format. Focusing specifically on our selected target market community who have similar needs and interests may yield excellent results.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Engaging a PR campaign to obtain publicity and increase visibility for our business.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Participating in writers' conferences and pitch fests, as well as submitting completed scripts for selection to film and theater festivals. While winning a contest is obviously a good way to add value to the product, even entering in such competitions will result in getting exposure for our Company and in some cases in reviews.

&#160;

Currently, Mr. Gardner promotes our products through many channels, including networking at local film and theater festivals and Internet sources, as well as expanding his personal professional relationships with small and experimental studios and independent producers. While Mr. Gardner has limited experience in developing and expanding a client base and marketing products to them, we anticipate that, as the Company grows over the next twelve months, pools of expertise will be acquired by recruiting within the theater and film production industry and by the use of technical and marketing consultants, which will allow qualified individuals to join Mr. Gardner on our management team and Board of Directors.

&#160;

Currently, Litera does not have any existing relationships with PR agents, publicists, producers or producer's agents.

&#160;

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

&#160;

The Company has not expended funds for research and development costs since inception. Other than utilizing Mr. Gardner's experiences and available industry and marketing information, Litera has not undertaken any research and development activities regarding our target market and marketability of our products. 

&#160;

THEATRICAL AND FILM PRODUCTION INDUSTRY 

&#160;

The major business centers of film and theatrical production are concentrated in the United States, Europe, India and China. The theatrical and film production industry consists of the technological and commercial institutions that are involved in creation of a film or stage performance, such as: production companies, studios, cinematography, choreography, production, screen/playwriting, pre-production, post production, film and theater festivals, actors, dancers, singers, film and theatrical producers, directors and other personnel. Due to the great expense required to produce a movie or a stage play, the making of a film or a performance usually has to be done in conjunction with an already established production company. However, the production of independent films and small scale stage performances has begun to evolve with the advent of more affordable equipment and more sophisticated consumer technology, as well as the increasing visibility of independent festivals such as Sundance Film Festival or Contemporary American Theater Festival. Independent projects are often described as less commercially-driven art forms which differ significantly from the norms of plot-driven, mainstream classical Hollywood cinema or Broadway theater. Catering specifically to the needs of independent film and theatrical producers and small and experimental production studios is the focus of the Company's business.

OUR SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYEE

&#160;

We currently have one employee, Mr. Gardner who is our founder and serves as our sole officer and director. Mr. Gardner currently devotes full time to our business and is responsible for our daily operations including product development, sales and marketing, fund raising, implementation of our general strategy and execution of our business plan. 

&#160;

Our future business and operating results depend significantly on the continued contributions and active participation of Mr. Gardner. This individual would be difficult or impossible to replace. The loss of this key contributor, or his failure to perform, could materially and adversely affect our Company's operations. While we may obtain Key Man insurance, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover the loss incurred in the event this executive officer is lost.

&#160;

Currently, our officer and director receives no compensation for his services during the development stage of our business operations. He is reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses he may incur on our behalf. In the future, we may approve payment of salaries for officers and directors, but currently, no such plans have been approved. We anticipate adding two (2) employees over the next twelve (12) months, one of which will be a screen/play writer. We do not have any employment agreements in place with our officer and director. We also do not currently have any benefits, such as health or life insurance, available to our employee.
