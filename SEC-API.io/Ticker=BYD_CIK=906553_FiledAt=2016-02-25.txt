 ITEM 1. Business 

Overview 

Boyd Gaming Corporation (the "Company," the "Registrant," "Boyd Gaming," "we" or "us") is a multi-jurisdictional gaming company that has been in operation since 1975. Headquartered in Las Vegas, we have 21 wholly-owned gaming entertainment properties in Nevada, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, and hold a 50% non-controlling interest in a limited liability company in New Jersey. 

Our primary areas of focus are: (i) ensuring our existing operations are managed as efficiently as possible and remain positioned for growth; (ii) improving our capital structure and strengthening our balance sheet, including paying down debt, improving operations and diversifying our asset base; and (iii) successfully implementing our growth strategy, which is built on identifying development opportunities and acquiring assets that are a good strategic fit and provide an appropriate return to our shareholders. 

Over the past several years, we have undertaken several programs aimed at reducing our cost structure in an effort to manage our properties' operations under tightened revenue trends. We have established a more efficient business model that we believe is helping us to realize improved results as consumer wealth and confidence continue to improve and the negative effects of global economic issues and the recent recession continue to decline. We are strategically reinvesting in our non-gaming amenities, including hotel rooms and restaurants, in order to better capitalize on customer&#8217;s evolving spending behaviors. We continue to manage our cost and expense structure to adjust to current business volumes and to generate strong and stable cash flows. 

During 2015, we completed several transactions that improved our long-term financial position and strengthened our balance sheet. During second quarter 2015, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due May 2023, and used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem all $500 million face amount outstanding of our 9.125% Senior Notes due December 2018. During the fourth quarter, we redeemed the HoldCo Note, which had been issued in 2012 when we acquired Peninsula Gaming, LLC. Over the last three years, we have reduced the combined Boyd Gaming and Peninsula outstanding debt balance by over $820 million. 

We continually work to position our Company for greater success by strengthening our existing operations and growing through capital investment and other strategic initiatives. An example is our ongoing strategic initiative to enhance our non-gaming amenities at properties across the country that is designed to ensure our properties remain competitive and compelling to customers across generations. This initiative began in 2014 and will continue into 2017, a period during which we expect to invest over $100 million in these amenities. In 2015, we redesigned and enhanced 1,700 hotel rooms at The Orleans, Suncoast and Blue Chip properties, bringing the total number of rooms renovated thus far to about 3,000. We also introduced five new food and beverage concepts in 2015: California Noodle House at the California, the Filament at Fremont, the Spotted Horse and Fast &#38; Lucy&#8217;s Pub at Evangeline Downs, and Brigg&#8217;s Oyster Company at Suncoast. We anticipate introducing about 20 additional new food and beverage concepts at our properties across the country in 2016. 

In addition to our non-gaming amenities initiative, in June 2015 we announced a $45 million expansion of our Delta Downs property in Vinton, Louisiana. Set for completion by the end of 2016, the centerpiece of this project is a new hotel tower, featuring 167 additional guest rooms and suites. The project also includes the redesign of all 200 existing rooms and of its food and beverage facilities. The special events center will also be expanded to better accommodate meeting and banquet functions. 

We believe that the following factors have contributed to our success in the past and are central to our success in the future: 

&#8226; 

we emphasize slot revenues, the most consistently profitable segment of the gaming industry; 

&#8226; 

we have comprehensive marketing and promotion programs; 

&#8226; 

six of our Las Vegas properties are well-positioned to capitalize on the Las Vegas locals market; 

&#8226; 

our downtown Las Vegas properties focus a majority of their marketing programs on, and derive a majority of their revenues from, a unique niche - Hawaiian customers; 

&#8226; 

our operations are geographically diversified within the United States; 

&#8226; 

we have the ability to expand certain existing properties and make opportunistic and strategic acquisitions; and 

&#8226; 

we have an experienced management team. 

Properties 

As of December 31, 2015 , we own or manage 1,243,007 &#32;square feet of casino space, containing 29,736 &#32;slot machines, 757 &#32;table games and 11,391 &#32;hotel rooms. We derive the majority of our gross revenues from our gaming operations, which generated approximately 76% &#32;of gross revenues for 2015 &#32;and 74% of gross revenues in both 2014 &#32;and 2013 . Food and beverage gross revenues represent our next most significant revenue source, generating approximately 13% &#32;of gross revenues for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . Room revenues and other revenues each contributed less than 10% of gross revenues during each year. 

We view each operating property as an operating segment. For financial reporting purposes, we aggregate our properties into five reportable business segments: (i) Las Vegas Locals; (ii) Downtown Las Vegas; (iii) Midwest and South; (iv) Peninsula; and (v) Borgata (which is comprised of our 50%-owned joint venture in Atlantic City, New Jersey). For further financial information related to our segments as of and for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 , see Note 15, Segment Information, &#32;to our consolidated financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8 . 

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our wholly-owned properties (listed by the segment in which each such property is reported) and Borgata, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 :

In addition to these properties, we own and operate a travel agency and a captive insurance company that underwrites travel-related insurance, each located in Hawaii. Financial results for these operations are included in our Downtown Las Vegas segment, as our Downtown Las Vegas properties concentrate their marketing efforts on gaming customers from Hawaii. 

Las Vegas Locals Properties 

Our Las Vegas Locals segment consists of six casinos that primarily serve the resident population of the Las Vegas metropolitan area, which was one of the fastest growing areas in the United States prior to the economic downturn. Las Vegas has historically been characterized by a vibrant economy and strong demographics that include a large population of retirees and other active gaming customers. The recent recession adversely impacted the growth and economy of Las Vegas, resulting in significant declines in the local housing market and unstable unemployment in the Las Vegas valley, which negatively affected consumer spending. In 2015, the Las Vegas economy strengthened, as reflected in the positive trends in unemployment, construction activity and visitation. Our Las Vegas Locals segment competes directly with other locals casinos and gaming companies, some of which operate larger casinos and offer different promotions than ours. 

Gold Coast Hotel and Casino 

Gold Coast Hotel and Casino ("Gold Coast") is located on Flamingo Road, approximately one mile west of the Las Vegas Strip and one-quarter mile west of Interstate 15, the major highway linking Las Vegas and southern California. Its location offers easy access from all four directions in the Las Vegas valley. The primary target market for Gold Coast consists of local middle-market customers who actively gamble. Gold Coast's amenities include 712 &#32;hotel rooms and suites along with meeting facilities, multiple restaurant options, a 70-lane bowling center and gaming, including slots, table games, a race and sports book and a bingo center. 

The Orleans Hotel and Casino 

The Orleans Hotel and Casino ("The Orleans") is located on Tropicana Avenue, a short distance from the Las Vegas Strip. The target markets for The Orleans are both local residents and visitors to the Las Vegas area. The Orleans provides an exciting New Orleans French Quarter-themed environment. Amenities at The Orleans include 1,885 &#32;hotel rooms, a variety of restaurants and bars, a spa and fitness center, 18 stadium-seating movie theaters, a 70-lane bowling center, banquet and meeting space, and a special events arena that seats up to 9,500 patrons. 

Sam's Town Hotel and Gambling Hall 

Sam's Town Hotel and Gambling Hall ("Sam's Town Las Vegas") is located on the Boulder Strip, approximately six miles east of the Las Vegas Strip, and features a contemporary western theme. Its informal, friendly atmosphere appeals to both local residents and visitors alike. Amenities at Sam's Town Las Vegas include 645 &#32;hotel rooms, a variety of restaurants and bars, 18 stadium-seating movie theaters, and a 56-lane bowling center. 

Suncoast Hotel and Casino 

Suncoast Hotel and Casino ("Suncoast") is located in Peccole Ranch, a master-planned community adjacent to Summerlin, and is readily accessible from most major points in Las Vegas, including downtown and the Las Vegas Strip. The primary target market for Suncoast consists of local middle-market customers who gamble frequently. Suncoast is a Mediterranean-themed facility that features 427 &#32;hotel rooms, multiple restaurant options, 25,000 square feet of banquet and meeting facilities, 16 stadium-seating movie theaters, and a 64-lane bowling center. 

Eldorado Casino and Jokers Wild Casino 

Located in downtown Henderson, the Eldorado Casino ("Eldorado") is approximately 14 miles from the Las Vegas Strip. Jokers Wild Casino ("Jokers Wild") is also located in Henderson. The amenities at each of these properties include a sports book and dining options, as well as gaming, including slots at both properties and table games at Jokers Wild. The principal customers of these properties are Henderson residents. 

Downtown Las Vegas Properties 

Our three Downtown Las Vegas properties directly compete with 12 casinos that operate in downtown Las Vegas. As such, we have developed a distinct niche for our downtown properties by focusing on customers from Hawaii. Our downtown properties focus their marketing on gaming enthusiasts from Hawaii and tour and travel agents in Hawaii with whom we have cultivated relationships since we opened our California Hotel and Casino (the "Cal") in 1975. Through our Hawaiian travel agency, Vacations Hawaii, we operate as many as four charter flights from Honolulu to Las Vegas each week, helping to ensure a stable supply of air transportation. We also have strong, informal relationships with other Hawaiian travel agencies and offer affordable all-inclusive packages. These relationships, combined with our Hawaiian promotions, have allowed the Cal, Fremont Hotel and Casino ("Fremont") and Main Street Station Casino, Brewery and Hotel ("Main Street Station") to capture a significant share of the Hawaiian tourist trade in Las Vegas. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , patrons from Hawaii comprised approximately 64% of the occupied room nights at the Cal, 41% of the occupied room nights at Fremont, and 47% of the occupied room nights at Main Street Station. 

California Hotel and Casino 

The Cal's amenities include 781 &#32;hotel rooms, multiple dining options, a sports book, and meeting space. The Cal and Main Street Station are connected by an indoor pedestrian bridge. 

Fremont Hotel and Casino 

Fremont is adjacent to the principal pedestrian thoroughfare in downtown Las Vegas, known as the Fremont Street Experience. The property's amenities include 447 &#32;hotel rooms, a race and sports book, and meeting space. 

Main Street Station Casino, Brewery and Hotel 

Main Street Station's amenities include 406 &#32;hotel rooms and three restaurants, one of which includes a brewery. In addition, Main Street Station features a 96-space recreational vehicle park, the only such facility in the downtown area. 

Midwest and South Properties 

Our Midwest and South properties consist of four dockside riverboat casinos, one racino and two barge-based casinos that operate in four states in the Midwest and southern United States. Generally, these states allow casino gaming on a limited basis through the issuance of a limited number of gaming licenses.

Borgata Hotel Casino &#38; Spa 

Borgata opened in Atlantic City, New Jersey in July 2003. Atlantic City is predominantly a regional day-trip and overnight-trip market.

The property has a total of 2,767 &#32;guest rooms and suites comprised of 1,970 guest rooms and suites at Borgata hotel and 797 guest rooms and suites at The Water Club.

In addition, the property contains approximately 88,000 square feet of meeting and event space, as well as two entertainment venues. Borgata was master-planned with ease of access and designed as a single-level casino floor with appealing design elements, including the placement of multiple food and beverage outlets on the casino floor itself. Its location in the Marina District provides guests with convenient access to the property via the Atlantic City Expressway Connector tunnel, without the delays associated with driving to competing casinos located on the Boardwalk of Atlantic City. 

In June 2013, Boyd, Borgata, and Digital Entertainment PLC ("bwin") completed definitive documentation for their business arrangements in New Jersey. Pursuant to this arrangement, bwin is providing Borgata with bwin&#8217;s technology platform and service to facilitate the offering of Borgata branded online gaming services and Borgata provides bwin access to the online gaming market in New Jersey by permitting bwin to offer PartyPoker branded online gaming services pursuant to Borgata&#8217;s casino gaming license (as required by regulations in New Jersey). In connection with this arrangement, Boyd Gaming owns 10% of the bwin New Jersey subsidiary offering PartyPoker branded online gaming services in New Jersey. In October 2013, Borgata was the first casino in New Jersey to be issued an internet gambling permit, the permit necessary for a casino to offer online gaming in the State. In November 2013, bwin was issued a transactional waiver, which permits them to act as a provider of online gaming services while the licensing investigation continues. 

In November 2013, Borgata launched a real money online gaming website in New Jersey developed under an agreement with bwin. Through the end of December 2015, Borgata achieved a 25.6% share of the online gaming market. Online gaming also provides Borgata with a new distribution channel to deliver its market-leading gaming experience to customers. 

Borgata was developed as a 50%/50% joint venture between our wholly-owned subsidiary, Boyd Atlantic City, Inc. ("BAC"), and MAC, Corp. ("MAC"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of MGM Resorts International ("MGM"). On March 17, 2010, MGM announced that its settlement agreement with the Division of Gaming Enforcement Office of the Attorney General of the State of New Jersey (the "NJDGE") had been approved by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission ("NJCCC"). In connection with MGM&#8217;s settlement agreement with the NJDGE, on March 24, 2010, MAC transferred its 50% ownership interest (the "MGM Interest") in Marina District Development Holding Co., LLC ("Holding Company"), and certain land leased to Marina District Development Company, LLC ("MDDC"), into a divestiture trust, of which MGM and its subsidiaries are the economic beneficiaries (the "Divestiture Trust"), for sale to a third party. Holding Company is the parent of MDDC, the entity that developed, owns and operates Borgata. As managing member of Holding Company pursuant to the terms of the operating agreement of Holding Company between BAC and MAC, BAC, through Holding Company, has responsibility for the oversight and management of Borgata&#8217;s day-to-day operations. 

Upon the transfer of MGM's ownership interest into the Divestiture Trust on March 24, 2010, we determined that we had control, as defined in the relevant accounting literature, of Holding Company and commenced consolidating the business as of that date. Subsequent to a Joint Petition of MGM, the Company and Holding Company, on February 13, 2013, the NJCCC approved amendments to the settlement agreement which permitted MGM to file an application for a statement of compliance, which, if approved, would permit MGM to reacquire its interest in Holding Company. 

The NJCCC approved MGM&#8217;s application for licensure on September 10, 2014. On September 30, 2014, the Divestiture Trust was dissolved and MGM reacquired its Borgata interest and its substantive participation rights in the management of Holding Company. As a result, we deconsolidated Borgata as of the close of business on September 30, 2014, eliminating the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests recorded for Holding Company from our balance sheet, and are accounting for our investment in Borgata applying the equity method for periods subsequent to the deconsolidation. As a result of the deconsolidation, we adjusted the book value of our investment to equal fair value and recognized a loss due to the deconsolidation of $12.1 million in our third quarter 2014 results, which was recorded in impairments of assets on our consolidated statement of operations. 

Competition 

Our properties generally operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against other gaming companies as well as other hospitality, entertainment and leisure companies. We face significant competition in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such competition may intensify in some of these jurisdictions if new gaming operations open in these markets or existing competitors expand their operations. Our properties compete directly with other gaming properties in each state in which we operate, as well as in adjacent states. We also compete for customers with other casino operators in other markets, including casinos located on Native American reservations, and other forms of gaming, such as lotteries and internet gaming. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater name recognition and marketing and financial resources. In some instances, particularly with Native American casinos, our competitors pay substantially lower taxes or no taxes at all. We believe that increased legalized gaming in other states, particularly in areas close to our existing gaming properties and the development or expansion of Native American gaming in or near the states in which we operate, could create additional competition for us and could adversely affect our operations or future development projects. 

Future Development Opportunities 

Development agreement with Wilton Rancheria 

We have a development agreement and a management agreement with Wilton Rancheria, a federally-recognized tribe located about 30 miles southeast of Sacramento, California, to develop and manage a gaming entertainment complex. 

Agreements with bwin 

During October 2011, we entered into an agreement with bwin, the world's largest publicly traded online gaming company. Per this agreement, should Congress legalize online poker in the United States, and subject to regulatory approvals, we would acquire a 10% stake in a new company that would offer online poker to United States-based players under bwin's brands, including PartyPoker. Separately, we entered into a 15-year agreement to use bwin's technology platform and associated services to offer online poker to United States players under a brand Boyd develops, assuming Congress passes enabling legislation. These agreements with bwin were subsequently modified to apply to online gaming (not just poker) on a state-by-state basis. These agreements are being utilized by Borgata to provide necessary technology infrastructure and back-of-house processing for Borgata&#8217;s online business that launched in November 2013. We can extend the agreement to additional states that legalize online gaming. 

Frequent Player Loyalty Programs 

B Connected 

We have established a nationwide branding initiative and loyalty program. Our players use their "B Connected" cards to earn and redeem points at nearly all of our wholly-owned Boyd Gaming properties in Nevada, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana and 

Mississippi. The "B Connected" club, among other benefits, extends the time period over which players may qualify for promotions and increases the credits awarded to reel slot and table games players. 

In addition to the "B Connected" player loyalty program, we launched the "B Connected Mobile" program in July 2010. "B Connected Mobile," the first multi-property, loyalty program-based iPhone and Android application of its kind in the gaming industry, is a personalized mobile application that delivers customized offers and information directly to a customer&#8217;s iPhone, iPad or Android device, making "B Connected Mobile" the first application of its kind available on multiple platforms. The application further expands the benefits of the "B Connected" program by providing real-time personalized information on hotel, dining and gaming offers when a customer visits a Boyd property, instant access to event information, schedules and special offers, a search engine that allows customers to find Boyd Gaming casinos that have their favorite machines and displays the games&#8217; locations on a casino floor map, the ability to track "B Connected" point balances in real time, and the ability to make immediate hotel or restaurant reservations. These tools allow our customers to receive the greatest value from their "B Connected" membership, and ensure that our marketing is as effective as possible. 

We further improved our "B Connected" loyalty program with the introduction of "B Connected Social" in the first quarter of 2012, which rewards users for using "B Connected Online", "B Connected Mobile", or sharing offers and events on social networks. "B Connected Social" is a dynamic network loyalty program that allows "B Connected" members to share offers with friends, connect to their favorite social networks, check in online via certain social networks, as well as participate in a variety of online activities including interfacing with "B Connected Online" or "B Connected Mobile", participate in online contests, and register for alerts to deliver targeted information specific to the "B Connected" member. 

Peninsula Programs 

During 2014, loyalty programs at three of the Peninsula properties were converted to "B Connected". The other two Peninsula properties continue to sponsor their own player loyalty programs to expand brand awareness and leverage their strong loyalty card programs, predicated on efforts to use marketing and promotional programs to serve an important role: to retain existing customers, maintain trip frequency and acquire new customers. These properties offer their guests comprehensive, competitive and targeted marketing and promotion programs. Each program, for example, offers players a hassle-free way of earning points redeemable for slot play, food, beverage and retail items as well as comp dollars and other rewards and benefits based on game play. In addition, each property strives to differentiate its casino with high-quality guest services to further enhance overall brand and customer experience. 

In the future we plan to extend the B Connected program to the remaining two Peninsula properties, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals. The implementation of "B Connected" will replace the individual property programs described above and provide Peninsula&#8217;s players with a multi-property player loyalty program. 

Other Promotional Activities 

From time to time, we offer other promotional offers and discounts targeted towards new customers, frequent customers, inactive customers, customers of various levels of play, and prospective customers who have not yet visited our properties, and mid-week and other promotional activities that seek to generate visits to our properties during slower periods. Complementaries are usually in the form of monetary discounts, and other rewards generally can only be redeemed at our restaurants, retail and spa facilities. 

Government Regulation 

We are subject to extensive regulation under laws, rules and supervisory procedures primarily in the jurisdictions where our facilities are located or docked. Some jurisdictions, including Nevada, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and New Jersey, empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and may require access to periodic reports respecting those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A detailed description of the governmental gaming regulations to which we are subject is filed as Exhibit 99.1 and is herein incorporated by reference. 

If additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate, such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. From time to time, various proposals have been introduced in the legislatures of some of the jurisdictions in which we have existing or planned operations that, if enacted, could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and us. We do not know whether or not such legislation will be enacted. The federal government has also previously considered a federal tax on casino revenues and the elimination of betting on NCAA events and may consider such a tax or eliminations on betting in the future. In addition, gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. Any material increase in these taxes or fees could adversely affect us. 

Employees and Labor Relations 

At December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 18,243 persons, and had collective bargaining agreements with three unions covering 1,948 employees. Employees at one property are covered by an expired agreement and &#32; are continuing to work under the terms of the expired agreement. Negotiations for a first contract will begin in early 2016 for a newly organized bargaining unit.
